- **[AntiGrounding: Lifting Robotic Actions into VLM Representation Space for Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12374)**  `arXiv:2506.12374`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode knowledge and reasoning capabilities for robotic manipulation within high-dimensional representation spaces. However, current approaches often project them into compressed intermediate representations, discarding important task-specific information such as fine-grained spatial or semantic details. To address this, we propose AntiGrounding, a new framework that reverses the instruction grounding process. It lifts candidate actions directly into the VLM representation space, renders trajectories from multiple views, and uses structured visual question answering for instruction-based decision making. This enables zero-shot synthesis of optimal closed-loop robot trajectories for new tasks. We also propose an offline policy refinement module that leverages past experience to enhance long-term performance. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that our method outperforms baselines across diverse robotic manipulation tasks.

- **[T-Rex: Task-Adaptive Spatial Representation Extraction for Robotic Manipulation with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19498)**  `arXiv:2506.19498`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yiteng Chen, Wenbo Li, Shiyi Wang, Huiping Zhuang, Qingyao Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Building a general robotic manipulation system capable of performing a wide variety of tasks in real-world settings is a challenging task. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic manipulation tasks, primarily due to the extensive world knowledge they gain from large-scale datasets. In this process, Spatial Representations (such as points representing object positions or vectors representing object orientations) act as a bridge between VLMs and real-world scene, effectively grounding the reasoning abilities of VLMs and applying them to specific task scenarios. However, existing VLM-based robotic approaches often adopt a fixed spatial representation extraction scheme for various tasks, resulting in insufficient representational capability or excessive extraction time. In this work, we introduce T-Rex, a Task-Adaptive Framework for Spatial Representation Extraction, which dynamically selects the most appropriate spatial representation extraction scheme for each entity based on specific task requirements. Our key insight is that task complexity determines the types and granularity of spatial representations, and Stronger representational capabilities are typically associated with Higher overall system operation costs. Through comprehensive experiments in real-world robotic environments, we show that our approach delivers significant advantages in spatial understanding, efficiency, and stability without additional training.

- **[Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19143)**  `arXiv:2506.19143`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an open-source tool (this http URL) for visualizing the outputs of our methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models.

- **[ReDit: Reward Dithering for Improved LLM Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18631)**  `arXiv:2506.18631`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect'' reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions, encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these advantages.

- **[Process Reward Models That Think](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16828)**  `arXiv:2504.16828`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  Step-by-step verifiers -- also known as process reward models (PRMs) -- are a key ingredient for test-time scaling. PRMs require step-level supervision, making them expensive to train. This work aims to build data-efficient PRMs as verbalized step-wise reward models that verify every step in the solution by generating a verification chain-of-thought (CoT). We propose ThinkPRM, a long CoT verifier fine-tuned on orders of magnitude fewer process labels than those required by discriminative PRMs. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent reasoning abilities of long CoT models, and outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and discriminative verifiers -- using only 1% of the process labels in PRM800K -- across several challenging benchmarks. Specifically, ThinkPRM beats the baselines on ProcessBench, MATH-500, and AIME '24 under best-of-N selection and reward-guided search. In an out-of-domain evaluation on a subset of GPQA-Diamond and LiveCodeBench, our PRM surpasses discriminative verifiers trained on the full PRM800K by 8% and 4.5%, respectively. Lastly, under the same token budget, ThinkPRM scales up verification compute more effectively compared to LLM-as-a-Judge, outperforming it by 7.2% on a subset of ProcessBench. Our work highlights the value of generative, long CoT PRMs that can scale test-time compute for verification while requiring minimal supervision for training. Our code, data, and models will be released atthis https URL.

- **[Understanding Reasoning in Thinking Language Models via Steering Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18167)**  `arXiv:2506.18167`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Constantin Venhoff, Iv√°n Arcuschin, Philip Torr, Arthur Conmy, Neel Nanda_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance, controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using three DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different model architectures.

- **[DRIFT: Data Reduction via Informative Feature Transformation- Generalization Begins Before Deep Learning starts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19734)**  `arXiv:2506.19734`  `cs.LG`  
  _Ben Keslaki_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern deep learning architectures excel at optimization, but only after the data has entered the network. The true bottleneck lies in preparing the right input: minimal, salient, and structured in a way that reflects the essential patterns of the data. We propose DRIFT (Data Reduction via Informative Feature Transformation), a novel preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational analysis in physical systems, to identify and extract the most resonant modes of input data prior to training. Unlike traditional models that attempt to learn amidst both signal and noise, DRIFT mimics physics perception by emphasizing informative features while discarding irrelevant elements. The result is a more compact and interpretable representation that enhances training stability and generalization performance. In DRIFT, images are projected onto a low-dimensional basis formed by spatial vibration mode shapes of plates, offering a physically grounded feature set. This enables neural networks to operate with drastically fewer input dimensions (~ 50 features on MNIST and less than 100 on CIFAR100) while achieving competitive classification accuracy. Extensive experiments across MNIST and CIFAR100 demonstrate DRIFT's superiority over standard pixel-based models and PCA in terms of training stability, resistance to overfitting, and generalization robustness. Notably, DRIFT displays minimal sensitivity to changes in batch size, network architecture, and image resolution, further establishing it as a resilient and efficient data representation strategy. This work shifts the focus from architecture engineering to input curation and underscores the power of physics-driven data transformations in advancing deep learning performance.

- **[Distilling Tool Knowledge into Language Models via Back-Translated Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19171)**  `arXiv:2506.19171`  `cs.LG`  
  _Xingyue Huang, Xianglong Hu, Zifeng Ding, Yuan He, Rishabh, Waleed Alzarooni, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical problems that require exact computation or multi-step algebraic reasoning. Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) offers a promising solution by leveraging external tools such as code interpreters to ensure correctness, but it introduces inference-time dependencies that hinder scalability and deployment. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for distilling tool knowledge into LLMs purely through natural language. We first construct a Solver Agent that solves math problems by interleaving planning, symbolic tool calls, and reflective reasoning. Then, using a back-translation pipeline powered by multiple LLM-based agents, we convert interleaved TIR traces into natural language reasoning traces. A Translator Agent generates explanations for individual tool calls, while a Rephrase Agent merges them into a fluent and globally coherent narrative. Empirically, we show that fine-tuning a small open-source model on these synthesized traces enables it to internalize both tool knowledge and structured reasoning patterns, yielding gains on competition-level math benchmarks without requiring tool access at inference.

- **[Command-V: Pasting LLM Behaviors via Activation Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19140)**  `arXiv:2506.19140`  `cs.LG`  
  _Barry Wang, Avi Schwarzschild, Alexander Robey, Ali Payani, Charles Fleming, Mingjie Sun, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrofitting large language models (LLMs) with new behaviors typically requires full finetuning or distillation-costly steps that must be repeated for every architecture. In this work, we introduce Command-V, a backpropagation-free behavior transfer method that copies an existing residual activation adapter from a donor model and pastes its effect into a recipient model. Command-V profiles layer activations on a small prompt set, derives linear converters between corresponding layers, and applies the donor intervention in the recipient's activation space. This process does not require access to the original training data and needs minimal compute. In three case studies-safety-refusal enhancement, jailbreak facilitation, and automatic chain-of-thought reasoning--Command-V matches or exceeds the performance of direct finetuning while using orders of magnitude less compute. Our code and data are accessible atthis https URL.

- **[A Comparative Study of NAFNet Baselines for Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19845)**  `arXiv:2506.19845`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Vladislav Esaulov, M. Moein Esfahani_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study NAFNet (Nonlinear Activation Free Network), a simple and efficient deep learning baseline for image restoration. By using CIFAR10 images corrupted with noise and blur, we conduct an ablation study of NAFNet's core components. Our baseline model implements SimpleGate activation, Simplified Channel Activation (SCA), and LayerNormalization. We compare this baseline to different variants that replace or remove components. Quantitative results (PSNR, SSIM) and examples illustrate how each modification affects restoration performance. Our findings support the NAFNet design: the SimpleGate and simplified attention mechanisms yield better results than conventional activations and attention, while LayerNorm proves to be important for stable training. We conclude with recommendations for model design, discuss potential improvements, and future work.

- **[Visual hallucination detection in large vision-language models via evidential conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19513)**  `arXiv:2506.19513`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Tao Huang, Zhekun Liu, Rui Wang, Yang Zhang, Liping Jing_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective, overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset, which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances, scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5, mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics, achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Mem4Nav: Boosting Vision-and-Language Navigation in Urban Environments with a Hierarchical Spatial-Cognition Long-Short Memory System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19433)**  `arXiv:2506.19433`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Lixuan He, Haoyu Dong, Zhenxing Chen, Yangcheng Yu, Jie Feng, Yong Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced viathis https URL.

- **[DaMO: A Data-Efficient Multimodal Orchestrator for Temporal Reasoning with Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11558)**  `arXiv:2506.11558`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Bo-Cheng Chiu, Jen-Jee Chen, Yu-Chee Tseng, Feng-Chi Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain, enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments, especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment, semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision. Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

- **[Surgery-R1: Advancing Surgical-VQLA with Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Model via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19469)**  `arXiv:2506.19469`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Pengfei Hao, Shuaibo Li, Hongqiu Wang, Zhizhuo Kou, Junhang Zhang, Guang Yang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of surgical scene understanding, particularly in the task of Visual Question Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA). However, existing Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning capabilities and interpretability in surgical scenes, which limits their reliability and potential for development in clinical applications. To address this issue, inspired by the development of Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we first build the Surgery-R1-54k dataset, including paired data for Visual-QA, Grounding-QA, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Then, we propose the first Reasoning MLLM for Surgical-VQLA (Surgery-R1). In our Surgery-R1, we design a two-stage fine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities by utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). Furthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our RFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional illusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in the Surgical-VQLA task and widely-used MLLMs, while also validating its reasoning capabilities and the effectiveness of our approach. The code and dataset will be organized inthis https URL.

- **[GLIMPSE: Gradient-Layer Importance Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation for Generative LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18985)**  `arXiv:2506.18985`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Guanxi Shen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large vision language models (LVLMs) have unlocked unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent responses from visual inputs. However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while generating free-form textual responses remains a significant challenge, yet is essential for understanding model behavior, diagnosing hallucination, exposing bias and ensuring transparency. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight, model-agnostic framework for visualizing the salient image regions that LVLMs rely upon during open-ended visual question answering (VQA), while concurrently revealing the multimodal textual saliency. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to produce holistic response-level attribution heat maps for interpreting cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods in human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution, trace token-level reasoning dynamics, and analyze systematic human-attention misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

- **[MSR-Align: Policy-Grounded Multimodal Alignment for Safety-Aware Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19257)**  `arXiv:2506.19257`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yinan Xia, Yilei Jiang, Yingshui Tan, Xiaoyong Zhu, Xiangyu Yue, Bo Zheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal reasoning tasks through enhanced chain-of-thought capabilities. However, this advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective foundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our dataset is made publicly available atthis https URL.

  _Yuqian Fu, Tinghong Chen, Jiajun Chai, Xihuai Wang, Songjun Tu, Guojun Yin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning tasks, yet the optimal integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a fundamental challenge. Through comprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and integration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key differences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes to LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective optimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training effectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both fine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach simultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using demonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage sequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks.

  Being prompted to engage in reasoning has emerged as a core technique for using large language models (LLMs), deploying additional inference-time compute to improve task performance. However, as LLMs increase in both size and adoption, inference costs are correspondingly becoming increasingly burdensome. How, then, might we optimize reasoning's cost-performance tradeoff? This work introduces a novel approach based on computational models of metareasoning used in cognitive science, training LLMs to selectively use intermediate reasoning steps only when necessary. We first develop a reward function that incorporates the Value of Computation by penalizing unnecessary reasoning, then use this reward function with Expert Iteration to train the LLM. Compared to few-shot chain-of-thought prompting and STaR, our method significantly reduces inference costs (20-37\% fewer tokens generated across three models) while maintaining task performance across diverse datasets.

  In the era of large-scale artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing. However, they often lack transparency and generate unreliable outputs, raising concerns about their interpretability. To address this, the Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting method structures reasoning into step-by-step deductions. Yet, not all reasoning chains are valid, and errors can lead to unreliable conclusions. We propose ECCoT, an End-to-End Cognitive Chain of Thought Validation Framework, to evaluate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs. ECCoT integrates the Markov Random Field-Embedded Topic Model (MRF-ETM) for topic-aware CoT generation and Causal Sentence-BERT (CSBert) for causal reasoning alignment. By filtering ineffective chains using structured ordering statistics, ECCoT improves interpretability, reduces biases, and enhances the trustworthiness of LLM-based decision-making. Key contributions include the introduction of ECCoT, MRF-ETM for topic-driven CoT generation, and CSBert for causal reasoning enhancement. Code is released at:this https URL.

- **[Can Large Language Models Capture Human Annotator Disagreements?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19467)**  `arXiv:2506.19467`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Jingwei Ni, Yu Fan, Vil√©m Zouhar, Donya Rooein, Alexander Hoyle, Mrinmaya Sachan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human annotation variation (i.e., annotation disagreements) is common in NLP and often reflects important information such as task subjectivity and sample ambiguity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for automatic annotation to reduce human effort, their evaluation often focuses on predicting the majority-voted "ground truth" labels. It is still unclear, however, whether these models also capture informative human annotation variation. Our work addresses this gap by extensively evaluating LLMs' ability to predict annotation disagreements without access to repeated human labels. Our results show that LLMs struggle with modeling disagreements, which can be overlooked by majority label-based evaluations. Notably, while RLVR-style (Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) reasoning generally boosts LLM performance, it degrades performance in disagreement prediction. Our findings highlight the critical need for evaluating and improving LLM annotators in disagreement modeling. Code and data atthis https URL.

- **[Language Models Might Not Understand You: Evaluating Theory of Mind via Story Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19089)**  `arXiv:2506.19089`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Nathaniel Getachew, Abulhair Saparov_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM) capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable $\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects. Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.

- **[KAG-Thinker: Interactive Thinking and Deep Reasoning in LLMs via Knowledge-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17728)**  `arXiv:2506.17728`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Dalong Zhang, Jun Xu, Jun Zhou, Lei Liang, Lin Yuan, Ling Zhong, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce KAG-Thinker, which upgrade KAG to a multi-turn interactive thinking and deep reasoning framework powered by a dedicated parameter-light large language model (LLM). Our approach constructs a structured thinking process for solving complex problems, enhancing the the logical coherence and contextual consistency of the reasoning process in question-answering (Q&A) tasks on domain-specific knowledge bases (KBs) within LLMs. Following the \textbf{Logical Form} guided retrieval and reasoning technology route of KAG, this framework first decomposes complex questions into independently solvable sub-problems (which are also referred to as logical forms) through \textbf{breadth decomposition}. Each such logical form is represented in two equivalent forms-natural language and logical function-and subsequently classified as either a Knowledge Retrieval or Reasoning Analysis task. Dependencies and parameter passing between these tasks are explicitly modeled via logical function interfaces. In the solving process, the Retrieval function performs retrieval tasks. It retrieves one-hop structured and unstructured information of specified knowledge unit. While the Math and Deduce functions are used to perform reasoning analysis tasks. Secondly, it is worth noting that, in the Knowledge Retrieval sub-problem tasks, LLMs and external knowledge sources are regarded as equivalent KBs. We use the \textbf{knowledge boundary} module to determine the optimal source using self-regulatory mechanisms such as confidence calibration and reflective reasoning, and use the \textbf{depth solving} module to enhance the comprehensiveness of knowledge acquisition...

  Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians' diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, HuatuoGPT-o1 scores 56.9 on knowledge but only 44.8 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.

  Distinguishing between human- and LLM-generated texts is crucial given the risks associated with misuse of LLMs. This paper investigates detection and explanation capabilities of current LLMs across two settings: binary (human vs. LLM-generated) and ternary classification (including an ``undecided'' class). We evaluate 6 close- and open-source LLMs of varying sizes and find that self-detection (LLMs identifying their own outputs) consistently outperforms cross-detection (identifying outputs from other LLMs), though both remain suboptimal. Introducing a ternary classification framework improves both detection accuracy and explanation quality across all models. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses using our human-annotated dataset, we identify key explanation failures, primarily reliance on inaccurate features, hallucinations, and flawed reasoning. Our findings underscore the limitations of current LLMs in self-detection and self-explanation, highlighting the need for further research to address overfitting and enhance generalizability.

  This paper introduces REACT, a benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within accountable, high-stakes decision-making tasks in medical and legal domains. Unlike traditional benchmarks primarily focused on prediction accuracy, REACT emphasizes transparent and interpretable reasoning, requiring models to align their logic closely with expert-derived procedures. To assess whether LLM reasoning aligns closely with human experts, we annotated 511 clinical cases from the medical domain and 86 legal cases from the legal domain, each enriched with detailed expert-extracted rationales and evidence supporting each step of the reasoning process. These annotations were guided by carefully constructed reasoning graphs, which explicitly encode domain-specific inference structures and decision criteria derived by domain experts. These reasoning graphs serve not only as standards for expert annotation but also as structured guidelines enabling models to reason transparently and step-by-step. To address the scalability challenges of manual annotation, we further developed a semi-automatic annotation pipeline leveraging expert-defined reasoning graph templates to efficiently generate new graphs, exploring the potential to extend our approach into additional critical domains. Experimental results demonstrate that reasoning graphs substantially enhance the interpretability and accuracy of LLM reasoning compared to traditional baselines, although significant gaps remain relative to expert-level reasoning performance.

  Recent advancements in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their powerful reasoning and diagnostic capabilities. Despite their success, current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis (MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an LLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient knowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly accessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and video modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance of modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance improvements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models.

  Reinforcement post training (RPT) has recently shown promise in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, it remains unclear how well these improvements generalize to new domains, as prior work evaluates RPT models on data from the same domains used for fine-tuning. To understand the generalizability of RPT, we conduct two studies. (1) Observational: We compare a wide range of open-weight RPT models against their corresponding base models across multiple domains, including both seen and unseen domains in their fine-tuning data. (2) Interventional: we fine-tune LLMs with RPT on single domains and evaluate their performance across multiple domains. Both studies converge on the same conclusion that, although RPT brings substantial gains on tasks similar to the fine-tuning data, the gains generalize inconsistently and can vanish on domains with different reasoning patterns.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) possess significant capabilities in open-world agent tasks, they also face challenges in rapidly adapting to new, specialized tasks due to their reliance on static pre-trained knowledge. Traditional methods such as fine-tuning are often costly, data-intensive, and may lead to "catastrophic forgetting." Therefore, we present KnowMap, a novel approach that dynamically constructs a knowledge base from environmental and experiential data. KnowMap fine-tunes a small knowledge-embedding model to equip a larger LLM with valuable task-specific knowledge. Our experiments on the ScienceWorld benchmark demonstrate 17.71% improvement for the performance of gpt-4-turbo model. KnowMap not only provides an efficient and effective means for LLM task-adapting, but also highlights how integrating environmental and experiential knowledge can enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

  This paper provides preliminary results on exploring the task of performing turn-level data augmentation for dialogue system based on different types of commonsense relationships, and the automatic evaluation of the generated synthetic turns. The proposed methodology takes advantage of the extended knowledge and zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions, understand contextual information, and their commonsense reasoning capabilities. The approach draws inspiration from methodologies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied more explicitly to the task of prompt-based generation for dialogue-based data augmentation conditioned on commonsense attributes, and the automatic evaluation of the generated dialogues.To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, first we extracted 200 randomly selected partial dialogues, from 5 different well-known dialogue datasets, and generate alternative responses conditioned on different event commonsense attributes. This novel dataset allows us to measure the proficiency of LLMs in generating contextually relevant commonsense knowledge, particularly up to 12 different specific ATOMIC [10] database relations. Secondly, we propose an evaluation framework to automatically detect the quality of the generated dataset inspired by the ACCENT [26] metric, which offers a nuanced approach to assess event commonsense. However, our method does not follow ACCENT's complex eventrelation tuple extraction process. Instead, we propose an instruction-based prompt for each commonsense attribute and use state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically detect the original attributes used when creating each augmented turn in the previous step.Preliminary results suggest that our approach effectively harnesses LLMs capabilities for commonsense reasoning and evaluation in dialogue systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing LLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability, it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample its continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols, particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning. This shows the potential of communication augmentation for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively evaluate \haf of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and highlight how "non-ideal" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and nonsensical responses. We open-source our code and LLM-generated explanations atthis https URL.

  Ensuring the moral reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a growing concern as these systems are used in socially sensitive tasks. Nevertheless, current evaluation benchmarks present two major shortcomings: a lack of annotations that justify moral classifications, which limits transparency and interpretability; and a predominant focus on English, which constrains the assessment of moral reasoning across diverse cultural settings. In this paper, we introduce MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark dataset for evaluating the moral reasoning of LLMs via hate speech multi-hop explanation using Moral Foundation Theory (MFT). The dataset comprises 3,000 tweets across Portuguese, Italian, Persian, and English, annotated with binary hate speech labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales. Empirical results highlight a misalignment between LLM outputs and human annotations in moral reasoning tasks. While LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to 0.836), their ability to predict moral sentiments is notably weak (F1 < 0.35). Furthermore, rationale alignment remains limited mainly in underrepresented languages. These findings show the limited capacity of current LLMs to internalize and reflect human moral reasoning.

  When artificial intelligence mistakes memorization for intelligence, it creates a dangerous mirage of reasoning. Existing studies treat memorization and self-knowledge deficits in LLMs as separate issues and do not recognize an intertwining link that degrades the trustworthiness of LLM responses. In our study, we utilize a novel framework to ascertain if LLMs genuinely learn reasoning patterns from training data or merely memorize them to assume competence across problems of similar complexity focused on STEM domains. Our analysis shows a noteworthy problem in generalization: LLMs draw confidence from memorized solutions to infer a higher self-knowledge about their reasoning ability, which manifests as an over 45% inconsistency in feasibility assessments when faced with self-validated, logically coherent task perturbations. This effect is most pronounced in science and medicine domains, which tend to have maximal standardized jargon and problems, further confirming our approach. Significant wavering within the self-knowledge of LLMs also shows flaws in current architectures and training patterns, highlighting the need for techniques that ensure a balanced, consistent stance on models' perceptions of their own knowledge for maximum AI explainability and trustworthiness. Our code and results are available publicly atthis https URL.

  Outcome-rewarded Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in mathematical problem-solving. However, this success often masks a critical issue: models frequently achieve correct answers through fundamentally unsound reasoning processes, a phenomenon indicative of reward hacking. We introduce MathOlympiadEval, a new dataset with fine-grained annotations, which reveals a significant gap between LLMs' answer correctness and their low process correctness. Existing automated methods like LLM-as-a-judge struggle to reliably detect these reasoning flaws. To address this, we propose ParaStepVerifier, a novel methodology for meticulous, step-by-step verification of mathematical solutions. ParaStepVerifier identifies incorrect reasoning steps. Empirical results demonstrate that ParaStepVerifier substantially improves the accuracy of identifying flawed solutions compared to baselines, especially for complex, multi-step problems. This offers a more robust path towards evaluating and training LLMs with genuine mathematical reasoning.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on prolonged reasoning chains to solve complex tasks. However, this trial-and-error approach often leads to high computational overhead and error propagation, where early mistakes can derail subsequent steps. To address these issues, we introduce Meta-Reasoner, a framework that dynamically optimizes inference-time reasoning by enabling LLMs to "think about how to think." Drawing inspiration from human meta-cognition and dual-process theory, Meta-Reasoner operates as a strategic advisor, decoupling high-level guidance from step-by-step generation. It employs contextual multi-armed bandits to iteratively evaluate reasoning progress and select optimal strategies (e.g., backtrack, clarify ambiguity, restart from scratch, or propose alternative approaches), and reallocates computational resources toward the most promising paths. Our evaluations on mathematical reasoning and puzzles highlight the potential of dynamic reasoning chains to overcome inherent challenges in the LLM reasoning process and also show promise in broader applications, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for reasoning-intensive tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities.

  Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex reasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually designed or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the reasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can effectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance well. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\% for the reasoning length on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss.

  The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to access relevant information but also to apply it within structured, goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+ consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more interpretable and capable LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing adoption of agentic workflows across diverse domains brings a critical need to scalably and systematically evaluate the complex traces these systems generate. Current evaluation methods depend on manual, domain-specific human analysis of lengthy workflow traces - an approach that does not scale with the growing complexity and volume of agentic outputs. Error analysis in these settings is further complicated by the interplay of external tool outputs and language model reasoning, making it more challenging than traditional software debugging. In this work, we (1) articulate the need for robust and dynamic evaluation methods for agentic workflow traces, (2) introduce a formal taxonomy of error types encountered in agentic systems, and (3) present a set of 148 large human-annotated traces (TRAIL) constructed using this taxonomy and grounded in established agentic benchmarks. To ensure ecological validity, we curate traces from both single and multi-agent systems, focusing on real-world applications such as software engineering and open-world information retrieval. Our evaluations reveal that modern long context LLMs perform poorly at trace debugging, with the best Gemini-2.5-pro model scoring a mere 11% on TRAIL. Our dataset and code are made publicly available to support and accelerate future research in scalable evaluation for agentic workflows.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for increasingly complex tasks. However, joint evolution across heterogeneous agents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training instability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL called JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively refining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves holistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities. Specifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on the behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO sampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal benefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with maximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve training stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter adjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution mechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to eliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across general and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves performance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller open-source models.

  A KG represents a network of entities and illustrates relationships between them. KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and discovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine learning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object) extraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and has been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to more recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given input-output examples.This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization, and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous empirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt optimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for triple extraction. In turn, these optimized prompts achieve improved results, particularly with increasing schema complexity and text size.

  Traditional recommendation systems often grapple with "filter bubbles", underutilization of external knowledge, and a disconnect between model optimization and business policy iteration. To address these limitations, this paper introduces RecLLM-R1, a novel recommendation framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and drawing inspiration from the DeepSeek R1 methodology. The framework initiates by transforming user profiles, historical interactions, and multi-faceted item attributes into LLM-interpretable natural language prompts through a carefully engineered data construction process. Subsequently, a two-stage training paradigm is employed: the initial stage involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to imbue the LLM with fundamental recommendation capabilities. The subsequent stage utilizes Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning technique, augmented with a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism. This stage guides the model through multi-step reasoning and holistic decision-making via a flexibly defined reward function, aiming to concurrently optimize recommendation accuracy, diversity, and other bespoke business objectives. Empirical evaluations on a real-world user behavior dataset from a large-scale social media platform demonstrate that RecLLM-R1 significantly surpasses existing baseline methods across a spectrum of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, diversity, and novelty. It effectively mitigates the filter bubble effect and presents a promising avenue for the integrated optimization of recommendation models and policies under intricate business goals.

  Large language models (LLMs) are known to perform well on language tasks, but struggle with reasoning tasks. This paper explores the ability of LLMs to play the 2D puzzle game Baba is You, in which players manipulate rules by rearranging text blocks that define object properties. Given that this rule-manipulation relies on language abilities and reasoning, it is a compelling challenge for LLMs. Six LLMs are evaluated using different prompt types, including (1) simple, (2) rule-extended and (3) action-extended prompts. In addition, two models (Mistral, OLMo) are finetuned using textual and structural data from the game. Results show that while larger models (particularly GPT-4o) perform better in reasoning and puzzle solving, smaller unadapted models struggle to recognize game mechanics or apply rule changes. Finetuning improves the ability to analyze the game levels, but does not significantly improve solution formulation. We conclude that even for state-of-the-art and finetuned LLMs, reasoning about dynamic rule changes is difficult (specifically, understanding the use-mention distinction). The results provide insights into the applicability of LLMs to complex problem-solving tasks and highlight the suitability of games with dynamically changing rules for testing reasoning and reflection by LLMs.

  Strategic randomization is a key principle in game theory, yet it remains underexplored in large language models (LLMs). Prior work often conflates the cognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness, leading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds to a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from untrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt styles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament gameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to randomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of prompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit hints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to exploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers. Through win/loss outcomes and Bayes factor analysis, we demonstrate meaningful variation in LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, highlighting opportunities for improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. We make our implementation publicly available atthis https URLto ensure full reproducibility.
