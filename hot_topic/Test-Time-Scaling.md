- **[3D CAVLA: Leveraging Depth and 3D Context to Generalize Vision Language Action Models for Unseen Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05800)**  `arXiv:2505.05800`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  Robotic manipulation in 3D requires learning an $N$ degree-of-freedom joint space trajectory of a robot manipulator. Robots must possess semantic and visual perception abilities to transform real-world mappings of their workspace into the low-level control necessary for object manipulation. Recent work has demonstrated the capabilities of fine-tuning large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to learn the mapping between RGB images, language instructions, and joint space control. These models typically take as input RGB images of the workspace and language instructions, and are trained on large datasets of teleoperated robot demonstrations. In this work, we explore methods to improve the scene context awareness of a popular recent Vision-Language-Action model by integrating chain-of-thought reasoning, depth perception, and task-oriented region of interest detection. Our experiments in the LIBERO simulation environment show that our proposed model, 3D-CAVLA, improves the success rate across various LIBERO task suites, achieving an average success rate of 98.1$\%$. We also evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of our method, demonstrating that 3D scene awareness leads to robust learning and adaptation for completely unseen tasks. 3D-CAVLA achieves an absolute improvement of 8.8$\%$ on unseen tasks. We will open-source our code and the unseen tasks dataset to promote community-driven research here:this https URL

- **[CityNavAgent: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation with Hierarchical Semantic Planning and Global Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05622)**  `arXiv:2505.05622`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Aerial vision-and-language navigation (VLN), requiring drones to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex urban environments, emerges as a critical embodied AI challenge that bridges human-robot interaction, 3D spatial reasoning, and real-world deployment. Although existing ground VLN agents achieved notable results in indoor and outdoor settings, they struggle in aerial VLN due to the absence of predefined navigation graphs and the exponentially expanding action space in long-horizon exploration. In this work, we propose \textbf{CityNavAgent}, a large language model (LLM)-empowered agent that significantly reduces the navigation complexity for urban aerial VLN. Specifically, we design a hierarchical semantic planning module (HSPM) that decomposes the long-horizon task into sub-goals with different semantic levels. The agent reaches the target progressively by achieving sub-goals with different capacities of the LLM. Additionally, a global memory module storing historical trajectories into a topological graph is developed to simplify navigation for visited targets. Extensive benchmark experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvement. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of different modules of CityNavAgent for aerial VLN in continuous city environments. The code is available at \href{this https URL}{link}.

- **[Harnessing LLMs Explanations to Boost Surrogate Models in Tabular Data Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05744)**  `arXiv:2505.05744`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Ruxue Shi, Hengrui Gu, Xu Shen, Xin Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in solving complex tasks, making them a promising tool for enhancing tabular learning. However, existing LLM-based methods suffer from high resource requirements, suboptimal demonstration selection, and limited interpretability, which largely hinder their prediction performance and application in the real world. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel in-context learning framework for tabular prediction. The core idea is to leverage the explanations generated by LLMs to guide a smaller, locally deployable Surrogate Language Model (SLM) to make interpretable tabular predictions. Specifically, our framework mainly involves three stages: (i) Post Hoc Explanation Generation, where LLMs are utilized to generate explanations for question-answer pairs in candidate demonstrations, providing insights into the reasoning behind the answer. (ii) Post Hoc Explanation-Guided Demonstrations Selection, which utilizes explanations generated by LLMs to guide the process of demonstration selection from candidate demonstrations. (iii) Post Hoc Explanation-Guided Interpretable SLM Prediction, which utilizes the demonstrations obtained in step (ii) as in-context and merges corresponding explanations as rationales to improve the performance of SLM and guide the model to generate interpretable outputs. Experimental results highlight the framework's effectiveness, with an average accuracy improvement of 5.31% across various tabular datasets in diverse domains.

- **[Credal Wrapper of Model Averaging for Uncertainty Estimation in Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15047)**  `arXiv:2405.15047`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Kaizheng Wang, Fabio Cuzzolin, Keivan Shariatmadar, David Moens, Hans Hallez_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents an innovative approach, called credal wrapper, to formulating a credal set representation of model averaging for Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and deep ensembles (DEs), capable of improving uncertainty estimation in classification tasks. Given a finite collection of single predictive distributions derived from BNNs or DEs, the proposed credal wrapper approach extracts an upper and a lower probability bound per class, acknowledging the epistemic uncertainty due to the availability of a limited amount of distributions. Such probability intervals over classes can be mapped on a convex set of probabilities (a credal set) from which, in turn, a unique prediction can be obtained using a transformation called intersection probability transformation. In this article, we conduct extensive experiments on several out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmarks, encompassing various dataset pairs (CIFAR10/100 vs SVHN/Tiny-ImageNet, CIFAR10 vs CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100 vs CIFAR100-C and ImageNet vs ImageNet-O) and using different network architectures (such as VGG16, ResNet-18/50, EfficientNet B2, and ViT Base). Compared to the BNN and DE baselines, the proposed credal wrapper method exhibits superior performance in uncertainty estimation and achieves a lower expected calibration error on corrupted data.

  Naturalistic driving studies use devices in participants' own vehicles to record daily driving over many months. Due to diverse and extensive amounts of data recorded, automated processing is necessary. This report describes methods to extract and characterize driver head scans at intersections from data collected from an in-car recording system that logged vehicle speed, GPS location, scene videos, and cabin videos. Custom tools were developed to mark the intersections, synchronize location and video data, and clip the cabin and scene videos for +/-100 meters from the intersection location. A custom-developed head pose detection AI model for wide angle head turns was run on the cabin videos to estimate the driver head pose, from which head scans >20 deg were computed in the horizontal direction. The scene videos were processed using a YOLO object detection model to detect traffic lights, stop signs, pedestrians, and other vehicles on the road. Turning maneuvers were independently detected using vehicle self-motion patterns. Stop lines on the road surface were detected using changing intensity patterns over time as the vehicle moved. The information obtained from processing the scene videos, along with the speed data was used in a rule-based algorithm to infer the intersection type, maneuver, and bounds. We processed 190 intersections from 3 vehicles driven in cities and suburban areas from Massachusetts and California. The automated video processing algorithm correctly detected intersection signage and maneuvers in 100% and 94% of instances, respectively. The median [IQR] error in detecting vehicle entry into the intersection was 1.1[0.4-4.9] meters and 0.2[0.1-0.54] seconds. The median overlap between ground truth and estimated intersection bounds was 0.88[0.82-0.93].

  Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While recent advancements have primarily focused on improving the model structure and training data of MRMs, there has been limited exploration into the effectiveness of long-term reasoning capabilities for reward modeling and how to activate these capabilities in MRMs. In this paper, we explore how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to improve reward modeling. Specifically, we reformulate the reward modeling problem as a rule-based RL task. However, we observe that directly applying existing RL algorithms, such as Reinforce++, to reward modeling often leads to training instability or even collapse due to the inherent limitations of these algorithms. To address this issue, we propose the StableReinforce algorithm, which refines the training loss, advantage estimation strategy, and reward design of existing RL methods. These refinements result in more stable training dynamics and superior performance. To facilitate MRM training, we collect 200K preference data from diverse datasets. Our reward model, R1-Reward, trained using the StableReinforce algorithm on this dataset, significantly improves performance on multimodal reward modeling benchmarks. Compared to previous SOTA models, R1-Reward achieves a $8.4\%$ improvement on the VL Reward-Bench and a $14.3\%$ improvement on the Multimodal Reward Bench. Moreover, with more inference compute, R1-Reward's performance is further enhanced, highlighting the potential of RL algorithms in optimizing MRMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of ConvNeXt and its variants has reaffirmed the conceptual and structural suitability of CNN-based models for vision tasks, re-establishing them as key players in image classification in general, and in facial expression recognition (FER) in particular. In this paper, we propose a new set of models that build on these advancements by incorporating a new set of attention mechanisms that combines Triplet attention with Squeeze-and-Excitation (TripSE) in four different variants. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these variants by applying them to the ResNet18, DenseNet and ConvNext architectures to validate their versatility and impact. Our study shows that incorporating a TripSE block in these CNN models boosts their performances, particularly for the ConvNeXt architecture, indicating its utility. We evaluate the proposed mechanisms and associated models across four datasets, namely CIFAR100, ImageNet, FER2013 and AffectNet datasets, where ConvNext with TripSE achieves state-of-the-art results with an accuracy of \textbf{78.27\%} on the popular FER2013 dataset, a new feat for this dataset.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual Learning entails progressively acquiring knowledge from new data while retaining previously acquired knowledge, thereby mitigating ``Catastrophic Forgetting'' in neural networks. Our work presents a novel uncertainty-driven Unsupervised Continual Learning framework using Generative Replay, namely ``Replay to Remember (R2R)''. The proposed R2R architecture efficiently uses unlabelled and synthetic labelled data in a balanced proportion using a cluster-level uncertainty-driven feedback mechanism and a VLM-powered generative replay module. Unlike traditional memory-buffer methods that depend on pretrained models and pseudo-labels, our R2R framework operates without any prior training. It leverages visual features from unlabeled data and adapts continuously using clustering-based uncertainty estimation coupled with dynamic thresholding. Concurrently, a generative replay mechanism along with DeepSeek-R1 powered CLIP VLM produces labelled synthetic data representative of past experiences, resembling biological visual thinking that replays memory to remember and act in new, unseen tasks. Extensive experimental analyses are carried out in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, SVHN and TinyImageNet datasets. Our proposed R2R approach improves knowledge retention, achieving a state-of-the-art performance of 98.13%, 73.06%, 93.41%, 95.18%, 59.74%, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art performance by over 4.36%.

- **[VladVA: Discriminative Fine-tuning of LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04378)**  `arXiv:2412.04378`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have become the de facto approach for discriminative vision-language representation learning. However, these models have limited language understanding, often exhibiting a "bag of words" behavior. At the same time, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which combine vision encoders with LLMs, have been shown to be capable of detailed vision-language reasoning, yet their autoregressive nature renders them less suitable for discriminative tasks.In this work, we propose to combine "the best of both worlds": a new training approach for discriminative fine-tuning of LVLMs that results in strong discriminative and compositional capabilities. Essentially, our approach converts a generative LVLM into a discriminative one, unlocking its capability for powerful image-text discrimination combined with enhanced language understanding.Our contributions include (1) a carefully designed training/optimization framework that utilizes image-text pairs of variable length and granularity for training the model with both contrastive and next-token prediction losses. This is accompanied by ablation studies that justify the necessity of our framework's components; (2) a parameter-efficient adaptation method using a combination of soft prompting and LoRA adapters; (3) significant improvements over state-of-the-art CLIP-like models of similar size, including standard image-text retrieval benchmarks and notable gains in compositionality.

  Recent advances in LVLMs have improved vision-language understanding, but they still struggle with spatial perception, limiting their ability to reason about complex 3D scenes. Unlike previous approaches that incorporate 3D representations into models to improve spatial understanding, we aim to unlock the potential of VLMs by leveraging spatially relevant image data. To this end, we introduce a novel 2D spatial data generation and annotation pipeline built upon scene data with 3D ground-truth. This pipeline enables the creation of a diverse set of spatial tasks, ranging from basic perception tasks to more complex reasoning tasks. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct SPAR-7M, a large-scale dataset generated from thousands of scenes across multiple public datasets. In addition, we introduce SPAR-Bench, a benchmark designed to offer a more comprehensive evaluation of spatial capabilities compared to existing spatial benchmarks, supporting both single-view and multi-view inputs. Training on both SPAR-7M and large-scale 2D datasets enables our models to achieve state-of-the-art performance on 2D spatial benchmarks. Further fine-tuning on 3D task-specific datasets yields competitive results, underscoring the effectiveness of our dataset in enhancing spatial reasoning.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely accessible, a detailed understanding of their knowledge within specific domains becomes necessary for successful real world use. This is particularly critical in public health, where failure to retrieve relevant, accurate, and current information could significantly impact UK residents. However, currently little is known about LLM knowledge of UK Government public health information. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new benchmark, PubHealthBench, with over 8000 questions for evaluating LLMs' Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and free form responses to public health queries, created via an automated pipeline. We also release a new dataset of the extracted UK Government public health guidance documents used as source text for PubHealthBench. Assessing 24 LLMs on PubHealthBench we find the latest private LLMs (GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1 and o1) have a high degree of knowledge, achieving >90% in the MCQA setup, and outperform humans with cursory search engine use. However, in the free form setup we see lower performance with no model scoring >75%. Therefore, whilst there are promising signs that state of the art (SOTA) LLMs are an increasingly accurate source of public health information, additional safeguards or tools may still be needed when providing free form responses on public health topics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating user interface (UI) design effectiveness extends beyond aesthetics to influencing user behavior, a principle central to Design Persuasiveness. A/B testing is the predominant method for determining which UI variations drive higher user engagement, but it is costly and time-consuming. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process automated UI analysis, current approaches focus on isolated design attributes rather than comparative persuasiveness-the key factor in optimizing user interactions. To address this, we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a benchmark designed for Pairwise UI Design Persuasiveness Assessment task, featuring 300 real-world UI image pairs labeled with A/B test results and expert rationales. Additionally, we propose G-FOCUS, a novel inference-time reasoning strategy that enhances VLM-based persuasiveness assessment by reducing position bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Experimental results show that G-FOCUS surpasses existing inference strategies in consistency and accuracy for pairwise UI evaluation. Through promoting VLM-driven evaluation of UI persuasiveness, our work offers an approach to complement A/B testing, propelling progress in scalable UI preference modeling and design optimization. Code and data will be released publicly.

- **[Assessing Robustness to Spurious Correlations in Post-Training Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05704)**  `arXiv:2505.05704`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Julia Shuieh, Prasann Singhal, Apaar Shanker, John Heyer, George Pu, Samuel Denton_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supervised and preference-based fine-tuning techniques have become popular for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user intent and correctness criteria. However, real-world training data often exhibits spurious correlations -- arising from biases, dataset artifacts, or other "shortcut" features -- that can compromise a model's performance or generalization. In this paper, we systematically evaluate three post-training algorithms -- Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and KTO (Kahneman-Tversky Optimization) -- across a diverse set of synthetic tasks and spuriousness conditions. Our tasks span mathematical reasoning, constrained instruction-following, and document-grounded question answering. We vary the degree of spurious correlation (10% vs. 90%) and investigate two forms of artifacts: "Feature Ambiguity" and "Distributional Narrowness." Our results show that the models often but not always degrade under higher spuriousness. The preference-based methods (DPO/KTO) can demonstrate relative robustness in mathematical reasoning tasks. By contrast, SFT maintains stronger performance in complex, context-intensive tasks. These findings highlight that no single post-training strategy universally outperforms in all scenarios; the best choice depends on the type of target task and the nature of spurious correlations.

- **[Bridging Legal Knowledge and AI: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Vector Stores, Knowledge Graphs, and Hierarchical Non-negative Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20364)**  `arXiv:2502.20364`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agentic Generative AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Vector Stores (VSs), represents a transformative technology applicable to specialized domains such as legal systems, research, recommender systems, cybersecurity, and global security, including proliferation research. This technology excels at inferring relationships within vast unstructured or semi-structured datasets. The legal domain here comprises complex data characterized by extensive, interrelated, and semi-structured knowledge systems with complex relations. It comprises constitutions, statutes, regulations, and case law. Extracting insights and navigating the intricate networks of legal documents and their relations is crucial for effective legal research. Here, we introduce a generative AI system that integrates RAG, VS, and KG, constructed via Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to enhance legal information retrieval and AI reasoning and minimize hallucinations. In the legal system, these technologies empower AI agents to identify and analyze complex connections among cases, statutes, and legal precedents, uncovering hidden relationships and predicting legal trends-challenging tasks that are essential for ensuring justice and improving operational efficiency. Our system employs web scraping techniques to systematically collect legal texts, such as statutes, constitutional provisions, and case law, from publicly accessible platforms like Justia. It bridges the gap between traditional keyword-based searches and contextual understanding by leveraging advanced semantic representations, hierarchical relationships, and latent topic discovery. This framework supports legal document clustering, summarization, and cross-referencing, for scalable, interpretable, and accurate retrieval for semi-structured data while advancing computational law and AI.

  _Max Glockner, Xiang Jiang, Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro, Iryna Gurevych, Markus Dreyer_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in large language models (LLMs) is challenging because benchmarks can quickly become stale. Questions initially requiring retrieval may become answerable from pretraining knowledge as newer models incorporate more recent information during pretraining, making it difficult to distinguish evidence-based reasoning from recall. We introduce NeoQA (News Events for Out-of-training Question Answering), a benchmark designed to address this issue. To construct NeoQA, we generated timelines and knowledge bases of fictional news events and entities along with news articles and Q\&A pairs to prevent LLMs from leveraging pretraining knowledge, ensuring that no prior evidence exists in their training data. We propose our dataset as a new platform for evaluating evidence-based question answering, as it requires LLMs to generate responses exclusively from retrieved evidence and only when sufficient evidence is available. NeoQA enables controlled evaluation across various evidence scenarios, including cases with missing or misleading details. Our findings indicate that LLMs struggle to distinguish subtle mismatches between questions and evidence, and suffer from short-cut reasoning when key information required to answer a question is missing from the evidence, underscoring key limitations in evidence-based reasoning.

  _Mo Li, Songyang Zhang, Taolin Zhang, Haodong Duan, Yunxin Liu, Kai Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The capability of large language models to handle long-context information is crucial across various real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often rely either on real-world long texts, making it difficult to exclude the influence of models' inherent knowledge, or introduce irrelevant filler content to artificially achieve target lengths, reducing assessment effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce NeedleBench, a synthetic framework for assessing retrieval and reasoning performance in bilingual long-context tasks with adaptive context lengths. NeedleBench systematically embeds key data points at varying depths to rigorously test model capabilities. Tasks are categorized into two scenarios: information-sparse, featuring minimal relevant details within extensive irrelevant text to simulate simple retrieval tasks; and information-dense (the Ancestral Trace Challenge), where relevant information is continuously distributed throughout the context to simulate complex reasoning tasks. Our experiments reveal that although recent reasoning models like Deepseek-R1 and OpenAI's o3 excel in mathematical reasoning, they struggle with continuous retrieval and reasoning in information-dense scenarios, even at shorter context lengths. We also characterize a phenomenon termed 'under-thinking', where models prematurely conclude reasoning despite available information. NeedleBench thus provides critical insights and targeted tools essential for evaluating and improving LLMs' long-context capabilities. All resources are available at OpenCompass:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent research have demonstrated LLMs' impressive performance in math and reasoning. However, the capacity of LLMs to address math problems under unconventional conditions, such as internal inconsistencies and flawed assumptions, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel benchmark Unreasonable Math Problem (UMP) designed to assess LLMs' ability to recognize and respond to unreasonability in math problem. The benchmark consists of a carefully curated collection of unreasonable math questions across diverse types. Based on extensive experiments covering 19 LLMs, we observe that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o achieve only limited performance of 0.6 in UMP, while reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 are prone to overthinking and unstable. We further explore strategies for improving the recognition of unreasonable inputs, shedding light on both the possibility and limitations of LLMs in this challenging setting.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding visual art requires reasoning across multiple perspectives -- cultural, historical, and stylistic -- beyond mere object recognition. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on general image captioning, they often fail to capture the nuanced interpretations that fine art demands. We propose ArtRAG, a novel, training-free framework that combines structured knowledge with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multi-perspective artwork explanation. ArtRAG automatically constructs an Art Context Knowledge Graph (ACKG) from domain-specific textual sources, organizing entities such as artists, movements, themes, and historical events into a rich, interpretable graph. At inference time, a multi-granular structured retriever selects semantically and topologically relevant subgraphs to guide generation. This enables MLLMs to produce contextually grounded, culturally informed art descriptions. Experiments on the SemArt and Artpedia datasets show that ArtRAG outperforms several heavily trained baselines. Human evaluations further confirm that ArtRAG generates coherent, insightful, and culturally enriched interpretations.

  _Biao Yi, Xavier Hu, Yurun Chen, Shengyu Zhang, Hongxia Yang, Fan Wu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cloud-based mobile agents powered by (multimodal) large language models ((M)LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities but suffer from high latency and cost. While fine-tuned (M)SLMs enable edge deployment, they often lose general capabilities and struggle with complex tasks. To address this, we propose \textbf{EcoAgent}, an \textbf{E}dge-\textbf{C}loud c\textbf{O}llaborative multi-agent framework for mobile automation. EcoAgent features a closed-loop collaboration among a cloud-based Planning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent for action execution and the Observation Agent for verifying outcomes. The Observation Agent uses a Pre-Understanding Module to compress screen images into concise text, reducing token usage and communication overhead. In case of failure, the Planning Agent retrieves screen history through a Memory Module and replans via a Reflection Module. Experiments on AndroidWorld show that EcoAgent achieves task success rates comparable to cloud-based mobile agents while significantly reducing MLLM token consumption, enabling efficient and practical mobile automation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Critical peer review of scientific manuscripts presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), partly due to data limitations and the complexity of expert reasoning. This report introduces Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP), a potentially broadly applicable prompt engineering methodology designed to bridge this gap using standard LLM chat interfaces (zero-code, no APIs). We present a proof-of-concept PWP prompt for the critical analysis of experimental chemistry manuscripts, featuring a hierarchical, modular architecture (structured via Markdown) that defines detailed analysis workflows. We develop this PWP prompt through iterative application of meta-prompting techniques and meta-reasoning aimed at systematically codifying expert review workflows, including tacit knowledge. Submitted once at the start of a session, this PWP prompt equips the LLM with persistent workflows triggered by subsequent queries, guiding modern reasoning LLMs through systematic, multimodal evaluations. Demonstrations show the PWP-guided LLM identifying major methodological flaws in a test case while mitigating LLM input bias and performing complex tasks, including distinguishing claims from evidence, integrating text/photo/figure analysis to infer parameters, executing quantitative feasibility checks, comparing estimates against claims, and assessing a priori plausibility. To ensure transparency and facilitate replication, we provide full prompts, detailed demonstration analyses, and logs of interactive chats as supplementary resources. Beyond the specific application, this work offers insights into the meta-development process itself, highlighting the potential of PWP, informed by detailed workflow formalization, to enable sophisticated analysis using readily available LLMs for complex scientific tasks.
