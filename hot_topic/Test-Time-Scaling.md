- **[Pretraining a Unified PDDL Domain from Real-World Demonstrations for Generalizable Robot Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21545)**  `arXiv:2507.21545`  `cs.RO`

  Robotic task planning in real-world environments requires reasoning over implicit constraints from language and vision. While LLMs and VLMs offer strong priors, they struggle with long-horizon structure and symbolic grounding. Existing methods that combine LLMs with symbolic planning often rely on handcrafted or narrow domains, limiting generalization. We propose UniDomain, a framework that pre-trains a PDDL domain from robot manipulation demonstrations and applies it for online robotic task planning. It extracts atomic domains from 12,393 manipulation videos to form a unified domain with 3137 operators, 2875 predicates, and 16481 causal edges. Given a target class of tasks, it retrieves relevant atomics from the unified domain and systematically fuses them into high-quality meta-domains to support compositional generalization in planning. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks show that UniDomain solves complex, unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner, achieving up to 58% higher task success and 160% improvement in plan optimality over state-of-the-art LLM and LLM-PDDL baselines.

- **[LITE: A Learning-Integrated Topological Explorer for Multi-Floor Indoor Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21517)**  `arXiv:2507.21517`  `cs.RO`

  This work focuses on multi-floor indoor exploration, which remains an open area of research. Compared to traditional methods, recent learning-based explorers have demonstrated significant potential due to their robust environmental learning and modeling capabilities, but most are restricted to 2D environments. In this paper, we proposed a learning-integrated topological explorer, LITE, for multi-floor indoor environments. LITE decomposes the environment into a floor-stair topology, enabling seamless integration of learning or non-learning-based 2D exploration methods for 3D exploration. As we incrementally build floor-stair topology in exploration using YOLO11-based instance segmentation model, the agent can transition between floors through a finite state machine. Additionally, we implement an attention-based 2D exploration policy that utilizes an attention mechanism to capture spatial dependencies between different regions, thereby determining the next global goal for more efficient exploration. Extensive comparison and ablation studies conducted on the HM3D and MP3D datasets demonstrate that our proposed 2D exploration policy significantly outperforms all baseline explorers in terms of exploration efficiency. Furthermore, experiments in several 3D multi-floor environments indicate that our framework is compatible with various 2D exploration methods, facilitating effective multi-floor indoor exploration. Finally, we validate our method in the real world with a quadruped robot, highlighting its strong generalization capabilities.

- **[Integration of Large Language Models within Cognitive Architectures for Autonomous Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14945)**  `arXiv:2309.14945`  `cs.RO`  
  _Miguel 츼. Gonz치lez-Santamarta, Irene Gonz치lez-Fern치ndez, Francisco J. Rodr칤guez-Lera, 츼ngel Manuel Guerrero-Higueras, Vicente Matell치n-Olivera_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Symbolic reasoning systems have been used in cognitive architectures to provide inference and planning capabilities. However, defining domains and problems has proven difficult and prone to errors. Moreover, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as tools to process natural language for different tasks. In this paper, we propose the use of LLMs to tackle these problems. This way, this paper proposes the integration of LLMs in the ROS 2-integrated cognitive architecture MERLIN2 for autonomous robots. Specifically, we present the design, development and deployment of how to leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs inside the deliberative processes of MERLIN2. As a result, the deliberative system is updated from a PDDL-based planner system to a natural language planning system. This proposal is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, measuring the impact of incorporating the LLMs in the cognitive architecture. Results show that a classical approach achieves better performance but the proposed solution provides an enhanced interaction through natural language.

- **[Towards Cognitive Synergy in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems: Integrating Theory of Mind and Critical Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21969)**  `arXiv:2507.21969`  `cs.MA`  
  _Adam Kostka, Jaros켹aw A. Chudziak_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, the field of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has gained popularity as researchers are trying to develop artificial intelligence capable of efficient collective reasoning. Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in isolated tasks, yet struggle with higher-order cognition required for adaptive collaboration. Human teams achieve synergy not only through knowledge sharing, but also through recursive reasoning, structured critique, and the ability to infer others' mental states. Current artificial systems lack these essential mechanisms, limiting their ability to engage in sophisticated collective reasoning. This work explores cognitive processes that enable effective collaboration, focusing on adaptive theory of mind (ToM) and systematic critical evaluation. We investigate three key questions. First, how does the ability to model others' perspectives enhance coordination and reduce redundant reasoning? Second, to what extent does structured critique improve reasoning quality by identifying logical gaps and mitigating biases? Third, the interplay of these mechanisms can lead to emergent cognitive synergy, where the collective intelligence of the system exceeds the sum of its parts. Through an empirical case study on complex decision making, we show that the integration of these cognitive mechanisms leads to more coherent, adaptive, and rigorous agent interactions. This article contributes to the field of cognitive science and AI research by presenting a structured framework that emulates human-like collaborative reasoning MAS. It highlights the significance of dynamic ToM and critical evaluation in advancing multi-agent systems' ability to tackle complex, real-world challenges.

- **[Embeddings to Diagnosis: Latent Fragility under Agentic Perturbations in Clinical LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21188)**  `arXiv:2507.21188`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs for clinical decision support often fail under small but clinically meaningful input shifts such as masking a symptom or negating a finding, despite high performance on static benchmarks. These reasoning failures frequently go undetected by standard NLP metrics, which are insensitive to latent representation shifts that drive diagnosis instability. We propose a geometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation Diagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical LLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of LDFR beyond synthetic settings. Our results reveal a persistent gap between surface robustness and semantic stability, underscoring the importance of geometry-aware auditing in safety-critical clinical AI.

- **[LLM-Adapted Interpretation Framework for Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21179)**  `arXiv:2507.21179`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Background & Aims: High-performance machine learning models like XGBoost are often "black boxes," limiting their clinical adoption due to a lack of interpretability. This study aims to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and narrative transparency for sarcopenia risk assessment. Methods: We propose the LLM-Adapted Interpretation Framework (LAI-ML), a novel knowledge distillation architecture. LAI-ML transforms feature attributions from a trained XGBoost model into a probabilistic format using specialized techniques (HAGA and CACS). A Large Language Model (LLM), guided by a reinforcement learning loop and case-based retrieval, then generates data-faithful diagnostic narratives. Results: The LAI-ML framework achieved 83% prediction accuracy, significantly outperforming the baseline XGBoost model, 13% higher. Notably, the LLM not only replicated the teacher model's logic but also corrected its predictions in 21.7% of discordant cases, demonstrating enhanced reasoning. Conclusion: LAI-ML effectively translates opaque model predictions into trustworthy and interpretable clinical insights, offering a deployable solution to the "black-box" problem in medical AI.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Progress in complex reasoning is constrained by the static nature of the current training datasets. We propose structured interaction as a new scaling axis, moving beyond the prevailing paradigm of increasing model parameters. Our self-evolving framework, AGORA, enables a collaborative ensemble to achieve reasoning performance exceeding state-of-the-art monolithic systems by up to 4.45 percentage points on challenging mathematical benchmarks. This gain stems from group emergent ability-the synthesis of collective capabilities unattainable by isolated models, validating interaction as a scalable driver of intelligence. Our results position the engineering of collaborative ecosystems as a vital frontier for capability emergence.

  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities. However, further enhancing existing MLLMs necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated, leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic, closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model, C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately. Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be released.

  Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose RAIF, a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Evaluation on OOD constraints also confirms the generalizability of our RAIF.

- **[Multimodal LLMs as Customized Reward Models for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21391)**  `arXiv:2507.21391`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with later-layer hiddenthis http URLaddition, LLaVA-Reward supports different types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives: text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have advanced capabilities in visual question answering (VQA). However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention remains a significant challenge, yet is essential for understanding model behavior. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that jointly attributes LVLM outputs to the most relevant visual evidence and textual signals that support open-ended generation. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted attention, adaptive layer propagation, and relevance-weighted token aggregation to produce holistic response-level heat maps for interpreting cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior methods in faithfulness and pushing the state-of-the-art in human-attention alignment. We demonstrate an analytic approach to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution, trace reasoning dynamics, analyze systematic misalignment, diagnose hallucination and bias, and ensure transparency.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure. These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning, allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and visual-semantic alignment. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models. However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm; 3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR) format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8% on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is publicly available atthis https URL.

  The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level (local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This compact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced reasoning over subtle facial musclethis http URLextensive evaluations on the benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a new state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis.

  _Aybora Koksal, A. Aydin Alatan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks. Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to 128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.

- **[EMIT: Enhancing MLLMs for Industrial Anomaly Detection via Difficulty-Aware GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21619)**  `arXiv:2507.21619`  `cs.CV`  
  _Wei Guan, Jun Lan, Jian Cao, Hao Tan, Huijia Zhu, Weiqiang Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model (InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

- **[TARS: MinMax Token-Adaptive Preference Strategy for Hallucination Reduction in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21584)**  `arXiv:2507.21584`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kejia Zhang, Keda Tao, Zhiming Luo, Chang Liu, Jiasheng Tang, Huan Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning, yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations. This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning. We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback, TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on several key metrics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally, we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses the inherent limitations of conventional bottleneck structures (diminished instance discriminability due to overemphasis on batch statistics) and decoupled heads (computational redundancy) in object detection frameworks by proposing two novel modules: the Instance-Specific Bottleneck with full-channel global self-attention (ISB) and the Instance-Specific Asymmetric Decoupled Head (ISADH). The ISB module innovatively reconstructs feature maps to establish an efficient full-channel global attention mechanism through synergistic fusion of batch-statistical and instance-specific features. Complementing this, the ISADH module pioneers an asymmetric decoupled architecture enabling hierarchical multi-dimensional feature integration via dual-stream batch-instance representation fusion. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate that the coordinated deployment of ISB and ISADH in the YOLO-PRO framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across all computational scales. Specifically, YOLO-PRO surpasses YOLOv8 by 1.0-1.6% AP (N/S/M/L/X scales) and outperforms YOLO11 by 0.1-0.5% AP in critical N/M/L/X groups, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. This work provides practical insights for developing high-precision detectors deployable on edge devices.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present SmoothRot, a novel post-training quantization technique to enhance the efficiency of 4-bit quantization in Large Language Models (LLMs). SmoothRot addresses the critical challenge of massive activation outliers, by integrating channel-wise scaling with Hadamard transformations. Our technique effectively transforms extreme outliers into quantization-friendly activations, significantly improving quantization accuracy. Experiments conducted on popular LLMs (LLaMA2 7B, LLaMA3.1 8B, and Mistral 7B) demonstrate that SmoothRot consistently reduces the performance gap between quantized and FP16 models by approximately 10-30\% across language generation and zero-shot reasoning tasks, without introducing additional inference latency.

- **[Post-Training Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21931)**  `arXiv:2507.21931`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated answers, limiting their reliability on reasoning-intensive tasks. We present Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that uses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans learn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several chain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final answer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are then used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization, similar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally curated rewards.RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates -- restoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step reasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and multiple-choice question answering.By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms reinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and data-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further research in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.

  We present HumorBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) ability to reason about and explain sophisticated humor in cartoon captions. As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks in mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model intelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally involved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of connections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural references, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately 300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest andthis http URL, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying essential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards the humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on this task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between concepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at the most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA models reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers effectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM reasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong transferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing thinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor reasoning.

  This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task. We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory. LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy, achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of 0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems, including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading, while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning, this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and broadening access through local deployment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We challenge the prevailing assumption that complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs) necessitates massive training data. We demonstrate that sophisticated mathematical reasoning can emerge with only a few examples. Specifically, through simple supervised fine-tuning, our model, LIMO, achieves 63.3\% accuracy on AIME24 and 95.6\% on MATH500, surpassing previous fine-tuned models (6.5\% on AIME24, 59.2\% on MATH500) while using only 1\% of the training data required by prior approaches. Furthermore, LIMO exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization, achieving a 45.8\% absolute improvement across diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x more data. Synthesizing these findings, we propose the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has been comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning can emerge through minimal but strategically designed demonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis suggests that the threshold for eliciting complex reasoning is not dictated by task complexity but rather by two key factors: (1) the completeness of the model's pre-trained knowledge base and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples in serving as "cognitive templates" that guide reasoning.

  Simulated patient systems play an important role in modern medical education and research, providing safe, integrative medical training environments and supporting clinical decision-making simulations. We developed AIPatient, an intelligent simulated patient system powered by large language model-based AI agents. The system incorporates the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, powered by six task-specific LLM-based AI agents for complex reasoning. For simulation reality, the system is also powered by the AIPatient KG (Knowledge Graph), built with de-identified real patient data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. Primary outcomes showcase the system's intelligence, including the system's accuracy in Electronic Record (EHR)-based medical Question Answering (QA), readability, robustness, and stability. The system achieved a QA accuracy of 94.15% when all six AI agents present, surpassing benchmarks with partial or no agent integration. Its knowledgebase demonstrated high validity (F1 score=0.89). Readability scores showed median Flesch Reading Ease at 77.23 and median Flesch Kincaid Grade at 5.6, indicating accessibility to all medical professionals. Robustness and stability were confirmed with non-significant variance (ANOVA F-value=0.6126, p > 0.1; F-value=0.782, p > 0.1). A user study with medical students further demonstrated that AIPatient offers high fidelity, strong usability, and effective educational value, performing comparably or better than human-simulated patients in medical history-taking scenarios. The promising intelligence of the AIPatient system highlights its potential to support a wide range of applications, including medical education, model evaluation, and system integration.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity, transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability over conventional RAG approaches.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, but relies on chunk-based retrieval that lacks structural semantics. GraphRAG methods improve RAG by modeling knowledge as entity-relation graphs, but still face challenges in high construction cost, fixed one-time retrieval, and reliance on long-context reasoning and prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-R1, an agentic GraphRAG framework via end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces lightweight knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as a multi-turn agent-environment interaction, and optimizes the agent process via an end-to-end reward mechanism. Experiments on standard RAG datasets show that Graph-R1 outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG methods in reasoning accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality.

  Large Language Models (LLMs), when enhanced through reasoning-oriented post-training, evolve into powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) further extends their capabilities by incorporating external tools, but existing methods often rely on rigid, predefined tool-use patterns that risk degrading core language competence. Inspired by the human ability to adaptively select tools, we introduce AutoTIR, a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to autonomously decide whether and which tool to invoke during the reasoning process, rather than following static tool-use strategies. AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward mechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness, structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby encouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive evaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general language modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall performance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior generalization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of reinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR capabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge conflict often arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, where retrieved documents may be inconsistent with one another or contradict the model's parametric knowledge. Existing benchmarks for investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues, we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions. Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.

  Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated, independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1) Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode, combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100 consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average), while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%). Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model capabilities.

  The demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated mathematical reasoning is growing across industries. However, the development of performant mathematical LLMs is critically bottlenecked by the scarcity of difficult, novel training data. We introduce \textbf{SAND-Math} (Synthetic Augmented Novel and Difficult Mathematics problems and solutions), a pipeline that addresses this by first generating high-quality problems from scratch and then systematically elevating their complexity via a new \textbf{Difficulty Hiking} step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two key findings. First, augmenting a strong baseline with SAND-Math data significantly boosts performance, outperforming the next-best synthetic dataset by \textbf{$\uparrow$ 17.85 absolute points} on the AIME25 benchmark. Second, in a dedicated ablation study, we show our Difficulty Hiking process is highly effective: by increasing average problem difficulty from 5.02 to 5.98, this step lifts AIME25 performance from 46.38\% to 49.23\%. The full generation pipeline, final dataset, and a fine-tuned model form a practical and scalable toolkit for building more capable and efficient mathematical reasoning LLMs. SAND-Math dataset is released here: \href{this https URL}{this https URL}

Despite minimal changes to the model architecture, the new series achieves substantial performance gains through enhanced training strategies in both pre-training and post-training stages. The series begins with \textbf{TeleChat2}, which undergoes pretraining on 10 trillion high-quality and diverse tokens. This is followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to further enhance its capabilities. \textbf{TeleChat2.5} and \textbf{T1} expand the pipeline by incorporating a continual pretraining phase with domain-specific datasets, combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve performance in code generation and mathematical reasoning tasks. The \textbf{T1} variant is designed for complex reasoning, supporting long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and demonstrating substantial improvements in mathematics and coding. In contrast, \textbf{TeleChat2.5} prioritizes speed, delivering rapid inference. Both flagship models of \textbf{T1} and \textbf{TeleChat2.5} are dense Transformer-based architectures with 115B parameters, showcasing significant advancements in reasoning and general task performance compared to the original TeleChat. Notably, \textbf{T1-115B} outperform proprietary models such as OpenAI's o1-mini and GPT-4o. We publicly release \textbf{TeleChat2}, \textbf{TeleChat2.5} and \textbf{T1}, including post-trained versions with 35B and 115B parameters, to empower developers and researchers with state-of-the-art language models tailored for diverse applications.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently output the label Unknown in reasoning tasks, where two scenarios may appear: (i) an input sample is genuinely unverifiable, but the model cannot understand why; and (ii) a verifiable problem that the model fails to solve, thus outputs Unknown. We refer to these cases collectively as the Vague Perception phenomenon. Current evaluations focus on whether such answers are honest, rather than analyzing the limits of LLM reasoning.To address this, we introduce WakenLLM, a framework that quantifies the portion of Unknown output attributable to model incapacity and evaluates whether stimulation can convert them into either correct answers (verifiable) or justified (unverifiable) responses with valid reasoning. Our method offers a clearer picture of the limits of LLM reasoning and the potential for corrections across various datasets. Comprehensive experiments on six LLMs suggest that, without any training or parameter revision, LLMs can achieve up to a 68.53% accuracy improvement on Vague Perception samples through guided understanding.Our work reveals that current baseline methods only activate a small portion of LLMs' reasoning potential, indicating considerable unexplored capacity. This extends the theoretical upper bounds of reasoning accuracy in LLMs. Consequently, this study deepens our understanding of the latent reasoning capacity of LLMs and offers a new perspective on addressing the Vague Perception phenomenon.

  In this work, we tackle the challenge of embedding realistic human personality traits into LLMs. Previous approaches have primarily focused on prompt-based methods that describe the behavior associated with the desired personality traits, suffering from realism and validity issues. To address these limitations, we introduce BIG5-CHAT, a large-scale dataset containing 100,000 dialogues designed to ground models in how humans express their personality in language. Leveraging this dataset, we explore Supervised Fine-Tuning and Direct Preference Optimization as training-based methods to align LLMs more naturally with human personality patterns. Our methods outperform prompting on personality assessments such as BFI and IPIP-NEO, with trait correlations more closely matching human data. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that models trained to exhibit higher conscientiousness, higher agreeableness, lower extraversion, and lower neuroticism display better performance on reasoning tasks, aligning with psychological findings on how these traits impact human cognitive performance. To our knowledge, this work is the first comprehensive study to demonstrate how training-based methods can shape LLM personalities through learning from real human behaviors.

  To fully expedite AI-powered chemical research, high-quality chemical databases are the cornerstone. Automatic extraction of chemical information from the literature is essential for constructing reaction databases, but it is currently limited by the multimodality and style variability of chemical information. In this work, we developed a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based multi-agent system for robust and automated chemical information extraction. It utilizes the MLLM's strong reasoning capability to understand the structure of diverse chemical graphics, decompose the extraction task into sub-tasks, and coordinate a set of specialized agents, each combining the capabilities of the MLLM with the precise, domain-specific strengths of dedicated tools, to solve them accurately and integrate the results into a unified output. Our system achieved an F1 score of 80.8% on a benchmark dataset of sophisticated multimodal chemical reaction graphics from the literature, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model (F1 score of 35.6%) by a significant margin. Additionally, it demonstrated consistent improvements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction image parsing, named entity recognition and text-based reaction extraction. This work is a critical step toward automated chemical information extraction into structured datasets, which will be a strong promoter of AI-driven chemical research.

  Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague, evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally, requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only 20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

  We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR automatically synthesizes (i) an instruction prompt for an inductive reasoning task, (ii) a validation program, executable on model outputs to provide verifiable rewards, and (iii) the latent ground-truth rule. This process is fully automated, scalable, requires no human annotations, and offers precise control over task difficulty. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 19k prompts organized into 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs demonstrate improved performance but incur very high test-time computation, with costs exceeding $300 for just 1,000 prompts. Finally, curriculum learning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. Moreover, these reasoning capabilities generalize to a wide range of established benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of SLR for downstream reasoning.

  The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities. Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training, we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process: 1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a "Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy; and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

  Large language models (LLMs) struggle with formal domains that require rigorous logical deduction and symbolic reasoning, such as mathematical proof generation. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1) we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require trustworthiness.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in enhancing step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning. However, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward rules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading to the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this challenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response diversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal (advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model reflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the fine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the EDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{D}riven Advantage and \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the problem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It is available atthis https URL.

  Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications. Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.

  Large language model (LLM) agents integrate pre-trained LLMs with modular algorithmic components and have shown remarkable reasoning and decision-making abilities. In this work, we investigate their use for two tightly intertwined challenges in workforce management: staffing, i.e., the assignment and scheduling of tasks to workers, which may require team formation; and profiling, i.e., the continuous estimation of workers' skills, preferences, and other latent attributes from unstructured data. We cast these problems in a formal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature estimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and profiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro allows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts textual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts directly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop, ensuring natural and intuitive use. By analyzing human feedback, our agent continuously estimates the latent features of workers, realizing life-long worker profiling and ensuring optimal staffing performance over time. A consulting firm simulation example demonstrates that StaffPro successfully estimates workers' attributes and generates high quality schedules. With its innovative design, StaffPro offers a robust, interpretable, and human-centric solution for automated personnel management.

  In this work, we study how vision-language models (VLMs) can be utilized to enhance the safety for the autonomous driving system, including perception, situational understanding, and path planning. However, existing research has largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K) and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18 sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge, enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval. By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and methodology for advancing research in traffic safety.

  The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial intelligence, offering unprecedented capabilities in reasoning, generalization, and zero-shot learning. These strengths open new frontiers in wireless communications, where increasing complexity and dynamics demand intelligent and adaptive solutions. This article explores the role of LLMs in transforming wireless systems across three key directions: adapting pretrained LLMs for core communication tasks, developing wireless-specific foundation models to balance versatility and efficiency, and enabling agentic LLMs with autonomous reasoning and coordination capabilities. We highlight recent advances, practical case studies, and the unique benefits of LLM-based approaches over traditional methods. Finally, we outline open challenges and research opportunities, including multimodal fusion, collaboration with lightweight models, and self-improving capabilities, charting a path toward intelligent, adaptive, and autonomous wireless networks of the future.

  Infrared spectroscopy offers rapid, non destructive measurement of chemical and material properties but suffers from high dimensional, overlapping spectral bands that challenge conventional chemometric approaches. Emerging large language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning, offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate, automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base, automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.

  Ontologies and knowledge graphs require continuous evolution to remain comprehensive and accurate, but manual curation is labor intensive. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits (e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance. We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router. Evo-DKD offers a new paradigm for LLM-driven knowledge base maintenance, combining the strengths of symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution.
