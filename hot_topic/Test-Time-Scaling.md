  Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level event forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast doubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved evaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching superforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been reported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity, knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks, utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to society in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths and considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology, aiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.

  Training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning via maths and code datasets has become a major new focus in LLM post-training. Two particularly popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU, while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together, our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.

- **[Step-3 is Large yet Affordable: Model-system Co-design for Cost-effective Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19427)**  `arXiv:2507.19427`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  Large language models (LLMs) face low hardware efficiency during decoding, especially for long-context reasoning tasks. This paper introduces Step-3, a 321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs achieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under 50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324 in the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm increasingly used to align large language models. Popular RL algorithms utilize multiple workers and can be modeled as a graph, where each node is the status of a worker and each edge represents dataflow between nodes. Owing to the heavy cross-node dependencies, the RL training system usually suffers from poor cluster scalability and low memory utilization. In this article, we introduce MindSpeed RL, an effective and efficient system for large-scale RL training. Unlike existing centralized methods, MindSpeed RL organizes the essential data dependencies in RL training, i.e., sample flow and resharding flow, from a distributed view. On the one hand, a distributed transfer dock strategy, which sets controllers and warehouses on the basis of the conventional replay buffer, is designed to release the dispatch overhead in the sample flow. A practical allgather--swap strategy is presented to eliminate redundant memory usage in resharding flow. In addition, MindSpeed RL further integrates numerous parallelization strategies and acceleration techniques for systematic optimization. Compared with existing state-of-the-art systems, comprehensive experiments on the RL training of popular Qwen2.5-Dense-7B/32B, Qwen3-MoE-30B, and DeepSeek-R1-MoE-671B show that MindSpeed RL increases the throughput by 1.42 ~ 3.97 times. Finally, we open--source MindSpeed RL and perform all the experiments on a super pod of Ascend with 384 neural processing units (NPUs) to demonstrate the powerful performance and reliability of Ascend.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A large language model (LLM) with knowledge in both scientific and general tasks is the foundation of science general intelligence. However, directly continued pretraining an LLM using science data usually leads to catastrophic forgetting, which indicates severe degradation in general ability. In this report, we present Innovator, which solves this problem by upcycling a pre-trained dense LLM into a fine-grained Mixtures-of-Experts model during continued pretraining, where different experts are expected to learn science knowledge in different disciplines, and a shared expert is utilized for general tasks. Innovator introduces a four-stage upcycle training paradigm: (1) Scientific Expert Induction on discipline-specific data, (2) Fine-grained Expert Splitting via FFN dimension decomposition, (3) Science-Aware Routing warmup, and (4) Generalist-Scientist Integration training on hybrid datasets. Such a paradigm enables knowledge in the general domain, and different scientific disciplines can be decoupled, avoiding the negative influence among knowledge in different domains. With 53.3B total parameters and 13.3B activated, Innovator extends Qwen2.5-7B using a shared general expert and 64 specialized scientific experts with 8 activated. Trained on 300B tokens with tri-level quality-controlled data, Innovator achieves 25% average improvement across 30 scientific tasks with a win rate as 70%, while retaining 99% performance in general tasks. Furthermore, Innovator-Reason, which is post-trained from Innovator for reasoning boosting, exhibits excellent reasoning performance in solving complex scientific problems with improvements over 30%.

  Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However, the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor, which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.

- **[CircuitProbe: Dissecting Spatiotemporal Visual Semantics with Circuit Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19420)**  `arXiv:2507.19420`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The processing mechanisms underlying language and image understanding in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied. However, the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a systematic, circuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual semantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our framework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing circuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we discover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object tokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%. Furthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions emerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs. In contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we reveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional localization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a foundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning. However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this, we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0% over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets, respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

  Spatial intelligence is emerging as a transformative frontier in AI, yet it remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. Unlike the abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic 3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence. We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting with physical environments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data, demanding sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it should be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do not constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be unified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks with distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote sensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on supervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote sensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing targets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity output generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for precise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable diverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific decoders or further fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that RemoteReasoner achieves remarkable performance across multi-granularity reasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level. Additionally, our framework enables novel capabilities such as the contour extraction task beyond the reach of existing reasoning pipelines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we propose a framework that creates a lively virtual dynamic scene with contextual motions of multiple humans. Generating multi-human contextual motion requires holistic reasoning over dynamic relationships among human-human and human-scene interactions. We adapt the power of a large language model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input and convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate multi-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before. Specifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a dynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a well-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we synthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial guidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive context, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the retrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale and with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of contextual reasoning. Benchmark results and user studies show that our framework effectively captures scene context with high scalability. The code and benchmark, along with result videos, are available at our project page:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To construct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive transfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks: image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT: SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and 10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding those of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that, as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.

- **[A Toolbox, Not a Hammer -- Multi-TAG: Scaling Math Reasoning with Multi-Tool Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18973)**  `arXiv:2507.18973`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Bohan Yao, Vikas Yadav_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks: MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0% to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often falls short when retrieved context includes confusing semi-relevant passages, or when answering questions require deep contextual understanding and reasoning. We propose an efficient fine-tuning framework, called PrismRAG, that (i) trains the model with distractor-aware QA pairs mixing gold evidence with subtle distractor passages, and (ii) instills reasoning-centric habits that make the LLM plan, rationalize, and synthesize without relying on extensive human engineered instructions. Evaluated across 12 open-book RAG QA benchmarks spanning diverse application domains and scenarios, PrismRAG improves average factuality by 5.4%, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias, potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed. These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language models (LLMs) to handle intricate language patterns and stilted translations that arise in automated translations. In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual and bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs. Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models, including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and applications.

- **[Toward Structured Knowledge Reasoning: Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00842)**  `arXiv:2506.00842`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Jiawei Gu, Ziting Xian, Yuanzhen Xie, Ye Liu, Enjie Liu, Ruichao Zhong, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on plain text tasks but underperform on structured data like tables and databases. Potential challenges arise from their underexposure during pre-training and rigid text-to-structure transfer mechanisms. Unlike humans who seamlessly apply learned patterns across data modalities, LLMs struggle to infer implicit relationships embedded in tabular formats, especially in the absence of explicit structural guidance. To bridge this cognitive gap, we introduce Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience (CoRE), a framework that builds experience memory representations and enhances generalization through contrastive In-Context Learning (ICL) to simulate human-like knowledge transfer. Experiments on Text-to-SQL and TableQA show CoRE significantly improves performance, achieving average gains of 3.44% and 4.24%, with up to 17.2% on challenging tasks. Our Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-generated Experience Memory expands training data 8-9x, enhancing diversity and domain coverage. This training-free and continual method propels LLMs toward structured knowledge expertise.

  High-quality dialogue is crucial for e-commerce customer service, yet traditional intent-based systems struggle with dynamic, multi-turn interactions. We present MindFlow+, a self-evolving dialogue agent that learns domain-specific behavior by combining large language models (LLMs) with imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL). MindFlow+ introduces two data-centric mechanisms to guide learning: tool-augmented demonstration construction, which exposes the model to knowledge-enhanced and agentic (ReAct-style) interactions for effective tool use; and reward-conditioned data modeling, which aligns responses with task-specific goals using reward signals. To evaluate the model's role in response generation, we introduce the AI Contribution Ratio, a novel metric quantifying AI involvement in dialogue. Experiments on real-world e-commerce conversations show that MindFlow+ outperforms strong baselines in contextual relevance, flexibility, and task accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of combining LLMs tool reasoning, and reward-guided learning to build domain-specialized, context-aware dialogue systems.

  We introduce the latest series of TeleChat models: \textbf{TeleChat2}, \textbf{TeleChat2.5}, and \textbf{T1}, offering a significant upgrade over their predecessor, TeleChat. Despite minimal changes to the model architecture, the new series achieves substantial performance gains through enhanced training strategies in both pre-training and post-training stages. The series begins with \textbf{TeleChat2}, which undergoes pretraining on 10 trillion high-quality and diverse tokens. This is followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to further enhance its capabilities. \textbf{TeleChat2.5} and \textbf{T1} expand the pipeline by incorporating a continual pretraining phase with domain-specific datasets, combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve performance in code generation and mathematical reasoning tasks. The \textbf{T1} variant is designed for complex reasoning, supporting long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and demonstrating substantial improvements in mathematics and coding. In contrast, \textbf{TeleChat2.5} prioritizes speed, delivering rapid inference. Both flagship models of \textbf{T1} and \textbf{TeleChat2.5} are dense Transformer-based architectures with 115B parameters, showcasing significant advancements in reasoning and general task performance compared to the original TeleChat. Notably, \textbf{T1-115B} outperform proprietary models such as OpenAI's o1-mini and GPT-4o. We publicly release \textbf{TeleChat2}, \textbf{TeleChat2.5} and \textbf{T1}, including post-trained versions with 35B and 115B parameters, to empower developers and researchers with state-of-the-art language models tailored for diverse applications.

  Existing informal language-based (e.g., human language) Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL) face a significant challenge: their verification processes, which provide crucial training signals, are neither reliable nor scalable. In fact, the prevalent large proprietary models could hardly generate verifiable programs. A promising yet largely uncharted alternative is formal language-based reasoning. Grounding LLMs in rigorous formal systems where generative models operate in formal language spaces (e.g., Dafny) enables the automatic and mathematically provable verification of their reasoning processes and outcomes. This capability is pivotal for achieving large-scale, reliable formal software verification. It is a common practice to employ human-annotated chain-of-thought and other human priors to induce the reasoning and coding capabilities of LLMs. Unfortunately, it becomes unacceptably all-consuming to provide such priors for supervising complex programming tasks. In this work, we systematically explore ways to reduce human priors with the formal language, Dafny, as the main environment for our pilot study. Our pipeline mainly relies on introducing an automatic and scalable data curation pipeline, and careful RL designs integrated with feedback from the formal language verifier. We introduce DafnyComp, a benchmark of compositional formal programs with auto-formalized specifications for specification reasoning. Our supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage enables even small models (e.g., 0.5B) to generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code, surpassing proprietary models. RL with regularization further improves performance, achieving stronger generalization to out-of-domain tasks and outperforming all strong baselines on the challenging DafnyComp benchmark.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the field of biomedical question answering, but their application in real-world clinical consultations still faces core challenges. Single-round consultation systems require patients to describe all symptoms upfront, leading to vague diagnosis with unclear complaints. Traditional multi-turn dialogue models, constrained by static supervised learning, lack flexibility and fail to intelligently extract key clinical information. To address these limitations, we propose \Ours{}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent collaborative framework that models medical consultations as a dynamic decision-making process under uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously optimizes its questioning strategy within the RL framework through multi-turn interactions with the patient agent, dynamically adjusting its information-gathering path based on comprehensive rewards from the Consultation Evaluator. This RL fine-tuning mechanism enables LLMs to autonomously develop interaction strategies aligned with clinical reasoning logic, rather than superficially imitating patterns in existing dialogue data. Notably, we constructed MTMedDialog, the first English multi-turn medical consultation dataset capable of simulating patient interactions. Experiments demonstrate that \Ours{} outperforms existing models in both multi-turn reasoning capability and final diagnostic performance. This approach shows immense practical value by reducing misdiagnosis risks in time-pressured settings, freeing clinicians for complex cases, and pioneering a strategy to optimize medical resource allocation and alleviate workforce shortages.

  Distilling reasoning paths from teacher to student models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) provides a shortcut for improving the reasoning ability of smaller Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reasoning paths generated by teacher models often reflect only surface-level traces of their underlying authentic reasoning. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that authentic reasoning involves a complex interweaving between meta-reasoning (which selects appropriate sub-problems from multiple candidates) and solving (which addresses the sub-problem). This implies authentic reasoning has an implicit multi-branch structure. Supervised fine-tuning collapses this rich structure into a flat sequence of token prediction in the teacher's reasoning path, preventing effective distillation of this structure to students. To address this limitation, we propose RLKD, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based distillation framework guided by a novel Generative Structure Reward Model (GSRM). Our GSRM converts reasoning paths into multiple meta-reasoning-solving steps and computes rewards to measure structural alignment between student and teacher reasoning. RLKD combines this reward with RL, enabling student LLMs to internalize the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure rather than merely mimicking fixed output paths. Experiments show RLKD surpasses standard SFT-RL pipelines even when trained on 0.1% of data under an RL-only regime, unlocking greater student reasoning potential than SFT-based distillation.

  Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by achieving state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. Recently, their effectiveness as embedding models has gained attention, marking a paradigm shift from traditional encoder-only models like ELMo and BERT to decoder-only, large-scale LLMs such as GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral. This survey provides an in-depth overview of this transition, beginning with foundational techniques before the LLM era, followed by LLM-based embedding models through two main strategies to derive embeddings from LLMs. 1) Direct prompting: We mainly discuss the prompt designs and the underlying rationale for deriving competitive embeddings. 2) Data-centric tuning: We cover extensive aspects that affect tuning an embedding model, including model architecture, training objectives, data constructions, etc. Upon the above, we also cover advanced methods for producing embeddings from longer texts, multilingual, code, cross-modal data, as well as reasoning-aware and other domain-specific scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss factors affecting choices of embedding models, such as performance/efficiency comparisons, dense vs sparse embeddings, pooling strategies, and scaling law. Lastly, the survey highlights the limitations and challenges in adapting LLMs for embeddings, including cross-task embedding quality, trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, low-resource, long-context, data bias, robustness, etc. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners by synthesizing current advancements, highlighting key challenges, and offering a comprehensive framework for future work aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of LLMs as embedding models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This position paper examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in social simulation, analyzing both their potential and their limitations from a computational social science perspective. The first part reviews recent findings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition, including Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also highlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true understanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys emerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on system architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such as Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of their design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations. Particular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity, calibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The final section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box systems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious games-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or predictive modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for hybrid approaches that integrate LLMs into traditional agent-based modeling platforms (GAMA, Netlogo, etc), enabling modelers to combine the expressive flexibility of language-based reasoning with the transparency and analytical rigor of classical rule-based systems.

  Building neural systems that can learn to execute symbolic algorithms is a challenging open problem in artificial intelligence, especially when aiming for strong generalization and out-of-distribution performance. In this work, we introduce a general framework for learning convergent term rewriting systems using a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by the rewriting algorithm itself. We present two modular implementations of such architecture: the Neural Rewriting System (NRS) and the Fast Neural Rewriting System (FastNRS). As a result of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both models can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering significant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and inference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the simplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their versatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is trained to solve multiple types of problems simultaneously. The proposed system significantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router, a recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic problems, and GPT-4o, one of the most powerful general-purpose large-language models. Moreover, our system matches or outperforms the latest o1-preview model from OpenAI that excels in reasoning benchmarks.

  The International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) poses uniquely challenging problems requiring deep insight, creativity, and formal reasoning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on mathematical benchmarks like AIME, they struggle with Olympiad-level tasks. We use Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro on the newly released IMO 2025 problems, avoiding data contamination. Using a self-verification pipeline with careful prompt design, 5 (out of 6) problems are solved correctly. This result underscores the importance of developing optimal strategies to harness the full potential of powerful LLMs for complex reasoning tasks.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and problem-solving across various domains. However, their ability to perform complex, multi-step reasoning task-essential for applications in science, medicine, and law-remains an area of active investigation. This paper examines the reasoning capabilities of contemporary LLMs, analyzing their strengths, limitations, and potential for improvement. The study uses prompt engineering techniques on the Graduate-Level GoogleProof Q&A (GPQA) dataset to assess the scientific reasoning of GPT-4o. Five popular prompt engineering techniques and two tailored promptings were tested: baseline direct answer (zero-shot), chain-of-thought (CoT), zero-shot CoT, self-ask, self-consistency, decomposition, and multipath promptings. Our findings indicate that while LLMs exhibit emergent reasoning abilities, they often rely on pattern recognition rather than true logical inference, leading to inconsistencies in complex problem-solving. The results indicated that self-consistency outperformed the other prompt engineering technique with an accuracy of 52.99%, followed by direct answer (52.23%). Zero-shot CoT (50%) outperformed multipath (48.44%), decomposition (47.77%), self-ask (46.88%), and CoT (43.75%). Self-consistency performed the second worst in explaining the answers. Simple techniques such as direct answer, CoT, and zero-shot CoT have the best scientific reasoning. We propose a research agenda aimed at bridging these gaps by integrating structured reasoning frameworks, hybrid AI approaches, and human-in-the-loop methodologies. By critically evaluating the reasoning mechanisms of LLMs, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on the future of artificial general intelligence and the development of more robust, trustworthy AI systems.
