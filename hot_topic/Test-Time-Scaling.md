- **[STRIVE: Structured Representation Integrating VLM Reasoning for Efficient Object Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06729)**  `arXiv:2505.06729`  `cs.RO`  
  _Haokun Zhu, Zongtai Li, Zhixuan Liu, Wenshan Wang, Ji Zhang, Jonathan Francis, et al._

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been increasingly integrated into object navigation tasks for their rich prior knowledge and strong reasoning abilities. However, applying VLMs to navigation poses two key challenges: effectively representing complex environment information and determining \textit{when and how} to query VLMs. Insufficient environment understanding and over-reliance on VLMs (e.g. querying at every step) can lead to unnecessary backtracking and reduced navigation efficiency, especially in continuous environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that constructs a multi-layer representation of the environment during navigation. This representation consists of viewpoint, object nodes, and room nodes. Viewpoints and object nodes facilitate intra-room exploration and accurate target localization, while room nodes support efficient inter-room planning. Building on this representation, we propose a novel two-stage navigation policy, integrating high-level planning guided by VLM reasoning with low-level VLM-assisted exploration to efficiently locate a goal object. We evaluated our approach on three simulated benchmarks (HM3D, RoboTHOR, and MP3D), and achieved state-of-the-art performance on both the success rate ($\mathord{\uparrow}\, 7.1\%$) and navigation efficiency ($\mathord{\uparrow}\, 12.5\%$). We further validate our method on a real robot platform, demonstrating strong robustness across 15 object navigation tasks in 10 different indoor environments.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function, combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1 substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks. These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications. Our code will be available atthis https URL.

- **[WebSailor-V2: Bridging the Chasm to Proprietary Agents via Synthetic Data and Scalable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13305)**  `arXiv:2509.13305`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Kuan Li, Zhongwang Zhang, Huifeng Yin, Rui Ye, Yida Zhao, Liwen Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability. Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks, matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

- **[When Inverse Data Outperforms: Exploring the Pitfalls of Mixed Data in Multi-Stage Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13079)**  `arXiv:2509.13079`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing work has shown that o1-level performance can be achieved with limited data distillation, but most existing methods focus on unidirectional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), overlooking the intricate interplay between diverse reasoning patterns. In this paper, we construct r1k, a high-quality reverse reasoning dataset derived by inverting 1,000 forward examples from s1k, and examine how SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) affect alignment under bidirectional reasoning objectives. SFT on r1k yields a 1.6%--6.8% accuracy improvement over s1k across evaluated benchmarks. However, naively mixing forward and reverse data during SFT weakens the directional distinction. Although DPO can partially recover this distinction, it also suppresses less preferred reasoning paths by shifting the probability mass toward irrelevant outputs. These findings suggest that mixed reasoning data introduce conflicting supervision signals, underscoring the need for robust and direction-aware alignment strategies.

- **[LoRA-PAR: A Flexible Dual-System LoRA Partitioning Approach to Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20999)**  `arXiv:2507.20999`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Yining Huang, Bin Li, Keke Tang, Meilian Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefit substantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing their performance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameter fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost, most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.

- **[Metacognitive Reuse: Turning Recurring LLM Reasoning Into Concise Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13237)**  `arXiv:2509.13237`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting extended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise, reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook" which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to conclude.

  Search has emerged as core infrastructure for LLM-based agents and is widely viewed as critical on the path toward more general intelligence. Finance is a particularly demanding proving ground: analysts routinely conduct complex, multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks requires deep financial expertise and time-sensitive data is hard to evaluate. We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises three tasks -- Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and Complex Historical Investigation -- closely reproduce real-world financial analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70 professional financial experts for annotation and implement a rigorous multi-stage quality-assurance pipeline. The benchmark includes 635 questions spanning global and Greater China markets, and we evaluate 21 models (products) on it. Grok 4 (web) tops the global subset, approaching expert-level accuracy. DouBao (web) leads on the Greater China subset. Experimental analyses show that equipping agents with web search and financial plugins substantially improves results on FinSearchComp, and the country origin of models and tools impact performancethis http URLaligning with realistic analyst tasks and providing end-to-end evaluation, FinSearchComp offers a professional, high-difficulty testbed for complex financial search and reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The two-stage fine-tuning paradigm of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empirically shown better reasoning performance than one-stage SFT for the post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that: (1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss; (2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries, \ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance. Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the \textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation.

  Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot hyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI, and efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8 tasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times on 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of best-performing baselines.

- **[Perception Before Reasoning: Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning for Visual Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13031)**  `arXiv:2509.13031`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance. However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

  Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however, they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes open-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.

  Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge. Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM, equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced editing tools without additional fine-tuning.Code is available:this https URL.

  It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications, offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000 synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation) diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations. These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques can be adapted to other fields.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

  We introduce PKR-QA (Procedural Knowledge Reasoning Question Answering), a new benchmark for question answering over procedural tasks that require structured reasoning. PKR-QA is constructed semi-automatically using a procedural knowledge graph (PKG), which encodes task-specific knowledge across diverse domains. The PKG is built by curating and linking information from the COIN instructional video dataset and the ontology, enriched with commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet and structured outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), followed by manual verification. To generate question-answer pairs, we design graph traversal templates where each template is applied systematically over PKG. To enable interpretable reasoning, we propose a neurosymbolic approach called Knowledge Module Learning (KML), which learns procedural relations via neural modules and composes them for structured reasoning with LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that this paradigm improves reasoning performance on PKR-QA and enables step-by-step reasoning traces that facilitate interpretability.

  Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many domains, yet their appli- cation to specialized fields remains constrained by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference. Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing over- fitting and ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves 75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models - when fine tuned properly - can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is infeasible. Beyond expand- ing research in the growing field of specialized small language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety, security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various industries.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled strong reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits step-by-step problem solving, but often at the cost of excessive verbosity in intermediate outputs, leading to increased computational overhead. We propose Sketch-of-Thought (SoT), a prompting framework that integrates cognitively inspired reasoning paradigms with linguistic constraints to reduce token usage while preserving reasoning accuracy. SoT is designed as a flexible, modular approach and is instantiated with three paradigms--Conceptual Chaining, Chunked Symbolism, and Expert Lexicons--each tailored to distinct reasoning tasks and selected dynamically at test-time by a lightweight routing model. Across 18 reasoning datasets spanning multiple domains, languages, and modalities, SoT achieves token reductions of up to 84% with minimal accuracy loss. In tasks such as mathematical and multi-hop reasoning, it even improves accuracy while shortening outputs.

  While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like text, aligning their outputs with complex, qualitative goals like pedagogical soundness remains a significant challenge. Standard reinforcement learning techniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on brittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic essence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) framework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient encoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a dense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a generated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards explanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and conceptually aligned with expert reasoning. We apply this method to the task of training a model for the Italian medical-school entrance examinations, following standard domain-adaptive continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our results demonstrate that GRPO with our proposed semantic reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over a strong SFT baseline, showcasing the power of using lightweight encoder models for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks

  Confidence estimation is essential for the reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs). Existing methods are primarily designed for factual QA tasks and often fail to generalize to reasoning tasks. To address this gap, we propose a set of training-free, graph-based confidence estimation methods tailored to reasoning tasks. Our approach models reasoning paths as directed graphs and estimates confidence by exploiting graph properties such as centrality, path convergence, and path weighting.

  Estimating the difficulty of input questions as perceived by large language models (LLMs) is essential for accurate performance evaluation and adaptive inference. Existing methods typically rely on repeated response sampling, auxiliary models, or fine-tuning the target model itself, which may incur substantial computational costs or compromise generality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for difficulty estimation that leverages only the hidden representations produced by the target LLM. We model the token-level generation process as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate the expected output quality given any hidden state. This allows for efficient and accurate difficulty estimation based solely on the initial hidden state, without generating any output tokens. Extensive experiments across both textual and multimodal tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines in difficulty estimation. Moreover, we apply our difficulty estimates to guide adaptive reasoning strategies, including Self-Consistency, Best-of-N, and Self-Refine, achieving higher inference efficiency with fewer generated tokens.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced the field of Automated Theorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely adopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing performance.

  The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their factual reliability. However, existing benchmarks are often limited by narrow domains of data, failing to capture the complexity of real-world medical information. To address this critical gap, we introduce MedFact, a new and challenging benchmark for Chinese medical fact-checking. MedFact comprises 2,116 expert-annotated instances curated from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 medical specialties, 8 fine-grained error types, 4 writing styles, and multiple difficulty levels. Its construction employs a hybrid AI-human framework where iterative expert feedback refines an AI-driven, multi-criteria filtering process, ensuring both high data quality and difficulty. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 leading LLMs, benchmarking their performance on veracity classification and error localization against a human expert baseline. Our results reveal that while models can often determine if a text contains an error, precisely localizing it remains a substantial challenge, with even top-performing models falling short of human performance. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a frequent ``over-criticism'' phenomenon, a tendency for models to misidentify correct information as erroneous, which is exacerbated by advanced reasoning techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and inference-time scaling. By highlighting these critical challenges for deploying LLMs in medical applications, MedFact provides a robust resource to drive the development of more factually reliable and medically aware models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As LLMs excel on standard reading comprehension benchmarks, attention is shifting toward evaluating their capacity for complex abstract reasoning and inference. Literature-based benchmarks, with their rich narrative and moral depth, provide a compelling framework for evaluating such deeper comprehension skills. Here, we present MORABLES, a human-verified benchmark built from fables and short stories drawn from historical literature. The main task is structured as multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference, with carefully crafted distractors that challenge models to go beyond shallow, extractive question answering. To further stress-test model robustness, we introduce adversarial variants designed to surface LLM vulnerabilities and shortcuts due to issues such as data contamination. Our findings show that, while larger models outperform smaller ones, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation and often rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning. This brittleness results in significant self-contradiction, with the best models refuting their own answers in roughly 20% of cases depending on the framing of the moral choice. Interestingly, reasoning-enhanced models fail to bridge this gap, suggesting that scale - not reasoning ability - is the primary driver of performance.

  Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong general-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many in-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to leverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without gradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning for broader chat workflows.Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8), MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it attains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat capabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves 75.4% on MMLU.

  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been proven effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recent advancements, such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, suggest that scaling up the length of CoT sequences during inference could further boost LLM reasoning performance. However, due to the autoregressive nature of LLM decoding, longer CoT outputs lead to a linear increase in inference latency, adversely affecting user experience, particularly when the CoT exceeds 10,000 tokens. To address this limitation, we analyze the semantic importance of tokens within CoT outputs and reveal that their contributions to reasoning vary. Building on this insight, we propose TokenSkip, a simple yet effective approach that enables LLMs to selectively skip less important tokens, allowing for controllable CoT compression. Extensive experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSkip in reducing CoT token usage while preserving strong reasoning performance. Notably, when applied to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, TokenSkip reduces reasoning tokens by 40% (from 313 to 181) on GSM8K, with less than a 0.4% performance drop. We release our code and checkpoints inthis https URL.

  Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation, we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of 4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web agents.

  Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving. However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably 39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring nuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents, counselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and alignment-oriented fine-tuning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models (LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis, that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over 10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.

  Temporal reasoning about historical events is a critical skill for NLP tasks like event extraction, historical entity linking, temporal question answering, timeline summarization, temporal event clustering and temporal natural language inference. Yet efforts on benchmarking temporal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are rather limited. Existing temporal reasoning datasets are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage and focus more on contemporary events. To address these limitations, we present HistoryBank, a multilingual database of 10M+ historical events extracted from Wikipedia timeline pages and article infoboxes. Our database provides unprecedented coverage in both historical depth and linguistic breadth with 10 languages. Additionally, we construct a comprehensive question answering benchmark for temporal reasoning across all languages. This benchmark covers a diverse set of 6 temporal QA reasoning tasks, and we evaluate a suite of popular language models (LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9b, Qwen3-8B, GPT4o) to assess their performance on these tasks. As expected GPT4o performs best across all answer types and languages; Gemma-2 outperforms the other small language models. Our work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for advancing multilingual and temporally-aware natural language understanding of historical events. To facilitate further research, we will make our code and datasets publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.

  Text-based person search (TBPS) enables the retrieval of person images from large-scale databases using natural language descriptions, offering critical value in surveillance applications. However, a major challenge lies in the labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic, dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague, incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy, robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.

  Training a task-specific small reasoning model is challenging when direct human supervision or high-quality labels are scarce. However, LLMs with reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies, to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams (EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600 EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond.

  Context faithfulness is essential for reliable reasoning in context-dependent scenarios. However, large language models often struggle to ground their outputs in the provided context, resulting in irrelevant responses. Inspired by the emergent expert specialization observed in mixture-of-experts architectures, this work investigates whether certain experts exhibit specialization in context utilization, offering a potential pathway toward targeted optimization for improved context faithfulness. To explore this, we propose Router Lens, a method that accurately identifies context-faithful experts. Our analysis reveals that these experts progressively amplify attention to relevant contextual information, thereby enhancing context grounding. Building on this insight, we introduce Context-faithful Expert Fine-Tuning (CEFT), a lightweight optimization approach that selectively fine-tunes context-faithful experts. Experiments across a wide range of benchmarks and models demonstrate that CEFT matches or surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning while being significantly more efficient.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit \textit{hallucinations}, generating factually incorrect or semantically irrelevant content in response to prompts. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can mitigate hallucinations by encouraging step-by-step reasoning, but its impact on hallucination detection remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of various detection methods. Our study highlights an overlooked trade-off in the use of reasoning. Code is publicly available at:this https URL.

  Iterative evaluation of LLMs during training is essential to ensure expected capability development, but can be time- and compute-intensive. While NLU tasks, where the model selects from fixed answer choices, are cheap to evaluate, essential capabilities like reasoning and code generation rely on the more time-consuming NLG (token-by-token generation) format. In this work, our aim is to decrease the computational burden of NLG benchmarks in order to enable monitoring crucial LLM capabilities during model training. We reformulate generative tasks into computationally cheaper NLU alternatives. We test the performance correlation between the original and reformulated tasks using 8 LMs of various sizes and 4 capabilities: mathematical reasoning, code generation, factual knowledge and reading comprehension. Our results show a strong correlation between task formats, supporting capability assessment via cheaper alternatives and achieving over 35x average reduction in evaluation time.

  Despite their remarkable progress across diverse domains, Large Language Models (LLMs) consistently fail at simple character-level tasks, such as counting letters in words, due to a fundamental limitation: tokenization. In this work, we frame this limitation as a problem of low mutual information and analyze it in terms of concept emergence. Using a suite of 19 synthetic tasks that isolate character-level reasoning in a controlled setting, we show that such capabilities emerge suddenly and only late in training. We find that percolation-based models of concept emergence explain these patterns, suggesting that learning character composition is not fundamentally different from learning commonsense knowledge. To address this bottleneck, we propose a lightweight architectural modification that significantly improves character-level reasoning while preserving the inductive advantages of subword models. Together, our results bridge low-level perceptual gaps in tokenized LMs and provide a principled framework for understanding and mitigating their structural blind spots. We make our code publicly available.

  Real-world vision language reasoning scenarios often include diverse and complex tasks. However, vision language reinforcement learning has primarily focused on a narrow set of tasks (e.g. geometry or chart reasoning), limiting the improvement of Vision Language Models' (VLMs) general reasoning. Therefore, we propose a novel Code2Logic approach, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize verifiable game reasoning tasks at scale via adapting game code. Using the Code2Logic, we developed the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is verifiable and scalable, offers controllable difficulty gradation and is diverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Then we apply Game-RL, which is simple reinforcement learning on GameQA. Surprisingly, despite training solely on game tasks, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization, specifically Qwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33% across 7 diverse vision-language benchmarks.

  Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on advanced mathematics benchmarks but sometimes fail on basic arithmetic tasks, raising the question of whether they have truly grasped fundamental arithmetic rules or are merely relying on pattern matching. To unravel this issue, we systematically probe LLMs' understanding of two-integer addition (0 to $2^64$) by testing three crucial properties: commutativity (A+B=B+A), representation invariance via symbolic remapping (e.g., $7 -> Y$), and consistent accuracy scaling with operand length. Our evaluation of 12 leading LLMs reveals a stark disconnect: while models achieve high numeric accuracy (73.8-99.8%), they systematically fail these diagnostics. Specifically, accuracy plummets to <= 7.5% with symbolic inputs, commutativity is violated in up to 20% of cases, and accuracy scaling is non-monotonic. These findings demonstrate that current LLMs address elementary addition via pattern matching, not robust rule induction, motivating new diagnostic benchmarks and innovations in model architecture and training to cultivate genuine mathematical reasoning.

LLMs' capabilities to autonomously find and fix runtime logical errors in complex data science code remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce DSDBench: the Data Science Debugging Benchmark, the first benchmark for systematic evaluation of LLMs on multi-hop error tracing and multi-bug detection in data science code debugging. DSDBench adapts datasets from existing data science task benchmarks, such as DABench and MatPlotBench, featuring realistic data science debugging tasks with automatically synthesized multi-hop, multi-bug code snippets. DSDBench includes 1,117 annotated samples with 741 cause-effect error pairs and runtime error messages. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on DSDBench show significant performance gaps, highlighting challenges in debugging logical runtime errors in data science code.

  Recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate multilingual abilities, yet they are English-centric due to dominance of English in training corpora. The limited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge. Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specific knowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whether code-switching can activate, or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoning when LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specific domains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource language tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various tasks, including solving math word problems (MWPs), but struggle with real-world problems containing irrelevant information. To address this, we propose a prompting framework that generates adversarial variants of MWPs by adding irrelevant variables. We introduce a dataset, PROBLEMATHIC, containing both adversarial and non-adversarial MWPs. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are susceptible to distraction by numerical noise, resulting in an average relative performance drop of ~26% on adversarial MWPs. To mitigate this, we fine-tune LLMs (Llama-2, Mistral) on the adversarial samples from our dataset. Fine-tuning on adversarial training instances improves performance on adversarial MWPs by ~8%, indicating increased robustness to noise and improved ability to identify relevant data for reasoning. Finally, to assess the generalizability of our prompting framework, we introduce GSM-8K-Adv, an adversarial variant of the GSM-8K benchmark. LLMs continue to struggle when faced with adversarial information, reducing performance by up to 6%.

  We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow, while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably, GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

  Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However, applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem, a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs, like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought, In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial optimization problems with preferential constraints.

  Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut, SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses: Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

  Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidable computational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise to multi-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditional constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability. While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent tothis http URLaddress these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated \textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes NCOPs resolution through learning to relax withthis http URL, we leverage structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance over the baselines.

  Financial news sentiment analysis is crucial for anticipating market movements. With the rise of AI techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs), which demonstrate strong text understanding capabilities, there has been renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes, embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis.

  Reasoning language models such as DeepSeek-R1 produce long chain-of-thought traces during inference time which make them costly to deploy at scale. We show that using compression techniques such as neural network pruning produces greater performance loss than in typical language modeling tasks, and in some cases can make the model slower since they cause the model to produce more thinking tokens but with worse performance. We show that this is partly due to the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction, whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces. This "Reasoning-Aware Compression" (RAC) integrates seamlessly into existing pruning workflows such as SparseGPT, and boosts their performance significantly.

  Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve real-world issues.A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity, limiting the effectiveness of TTS.Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding agents.To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn, tool-assisted setting.\sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than single-turn responses.We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model free approaches.On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks 1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are susceptible to the implicit reasoning risk, wherein innocuous unimodal inputs synergistically assemble into risky multimodal data that produce harmful outputs. We attribute this vulnerability to the difficulty of MLLMs maintaining safety alignment through long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce Safe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI), the first dataset featuring interpretable reasoning paths tailored for such a cross-modal challenge. A novel training framework, Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO), is also designed based on the SSUI dataset to align the MLLM's internal reasoning process with human safety values. Experimental results show that our SRPO-trained models achieve state-of-the-art results on key safety benchmarks, including the proposed Reasoning Path Benchmark (RSBench), significantly outperforming both open-source and top-tier commercial MLLMs.
