- **[LaViPlan : Language-Guided Visual Path Planning with RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12911)**  `arXiv:2507.12911`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving refer to situations that deviate from the training domain, often leading to unexpected and potentially hazardous behavior from planners that lack prior exposure to such cases. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics. This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents in the context of autonomous driving.

  Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in achieving human-like adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex, open-world environments. These challenges stem from fragmented architectures, limited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction from perception. To address these limitations, we propose a unified Perception-Language-Action (PLA) framework that integrates multi-sensor fusion (cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered reasoning core. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning. The results highlight the potential of language-augmented cognitive frameworks for advancing the safety, interpretability, and scalability of autonomous driving systems.

- **[Can LLM-Reasoning Models Replace Classical Planning? A Benchmark Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23589)**  `arXiv:2507.23589`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Kai Goebel, Patrik Zips_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models have sparked interest in their potential for robotic task planning. While these models demonstrate strong generative capabilities, their effectiveness in producing structured and executable plans remains uncertain. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of a broad spectrum of current state of the art language models, each directly prompted using Planning Domain Definition Language domain and problem files, and compares their planning performance with the Fast Downward planner across a variety of benchmarks. In addition to measuring success rates, we assess how faithfully the generated plans translate into sequences of actions that can actually be executed, identifying both strengths and limitations of using these models in this setting. Our findings show that while the models perform well on simpler planning tasks, they continue to struggle with more complex scenarios that require precise resource management, consistent state tracking, and strict constraint compliance. These results underscore fundamental challenges in applying language models to robotic planning in real world environments. By outlining the gaps that emerge during execution, we aim to guide future research toward combined approaches that integrate language models with classical planners in order to enhance the reliability and scalability of planning in autonomous robotics.

- **[CoA-VLA: Improving Vision-Language-Action Models via Visual-Textual Chain-of-Affordance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20451)**  `arXiv:2412.20451`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robot foundation models, particularly Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, have garnered significant attention for their ability to enhance robot policy learning, greatly improving robot's generalization and robustness. OpenAI's recent model, O1, showcased impressive capabilities in solving complex problems by utilizing extensive reasoning chains. This prompts an important question: can robot models achieve better performance in multi-task , complex environments by reviewing prior observations and then providing task-specific reasoning to guide action prediction? In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Affordance (CoA-VLA) , a novel approach to scaling robot models by incorporating reasoning in the format of sequential robot affordances to facilitate task completion. Specifically, we prompt the model to consider the following four types of affordances before taking action: (1) object affordance - what object to manipulate and where it is ; (2) grasp affordance - the specific object part to grasp ; (3) spatial affordance - the optimal space to place the object ; and (4) movement affordance-the collision - free path for movement. We further transform each affordance into two prompting formats: visual affordance and textual affordance. We introduce a novel vision-language co-injection module that integrates this knowledge into the policy network. This allows the robot to leverage essential contextual information during action inference, resulting in improved precision and robustness. Our experiments demonstrate that CoA-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art robot foundation models, including OpenVLA and Octo, on a variety of tasks. Furthermore, CoA-VLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities, including recognizing unseen object poses, identifying free space, and avoiding obstacles in novel environments.

  _Zhiyuan Liu, Leheng Li, Yuning Wang, Haotian Lin, Hao Cheng, Zhizhe Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating autonomous driving systems in complex and diverse traffic scenarios through controllable simulation is essential to ensure their safety and reliability. However, existing traffic simulation methods face challenges in their controllability. To address this, we propose a novel diffusion-based and LLM-enhanced traffic simulation framework. Our approach incorporates a high-level understanding module and a low-level refinement module, which systematically examines the hierarchical structure of traffic elements, guides LLMs to thoroughly analyze traffic scenario descriptions step by step, and refines the generation by self-reflection, enhancing their understanding of complex situations. Furthermore, we propose a Frenet-frame-based cost function framework that provides LLMs with geometrically meaningful quantities, improving their grasp of spatial relationships in a scenario and enabling more accurate cost function generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that our method can handle more intricate descriptions and generate a broader range of scenarios in a controllable manner.

- **[DynaSwarm: Dynamically Graph Structure Selection for LLM-based Multi-agent System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23261)**  `arXiv:2507.23261`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.MA`  
  _Hui Yi Leong, Yuqing Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

- **[GraphRAG-R1: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Process-Constrained Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23581)**  `arXiv:2507.23581`  `cs.LG`  
  _Chuanyue Yu, Kuo Zhao, Yuhan Li, Heng Chang, Mingjian Feng, Xiangzhe Jiang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships. However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems, autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation (PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently delivering performance improvements.

  _Jinan Zhou, Rajat Ghosh, Vaishnavi Bhargava, Debojyoti Dutta, Aryan Singhal_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When designing LLM services, practitioners care about three key properties: inference-time budget, factual authenticity, and reasoning capacity. However, our analysis shows that no model can simultaneously optimize for all three. We formally prove this trade-off and propose a principled framework named The BAR Theorem for LLM-application design.

  _Dongming Wu, Yanping Fu, Saike Huang, Yingfei Liu, Fan Jia, Nian Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions. However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces a novel benchmark, EGE-Math Solutions Assessment Benchmark, for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on their ability to assess hand-written mathematical solutions. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on problem solving, our approach centres on understanding student solutions, identifying mistakes, and assigning grades according to fixed criteria. We compile 122 scanned solutions from the Russian Unified State Exam (EGE) together with official expert grades, and evaluate seven modern VLMs from Google, OpenAI, Arcee AI, and Alibaba Cloud in three inference modes. The results reveal current limitations in mathematical reasoning and human-rubric alignment, opening new research avenues in AI-assisted assessment. You can find code inthis https URL

- **[FastDriveVLA: Efficient End-to-End Driving via Plug-and-Play Reconstruction-based Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23318)**  `arXiv:2507.23318`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Jiajun Cao, Qizhe Zhang, Peidong Jia, Xuhui Zhao, Bo Lan, Xiaoan Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.

- **[Beyond Gloss: A Hand-Centric Framework for Gloss-Free Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23575)**  `arXiv:2507.23575`  `cs.CV`  
  _Sobhan Asasi, Mohamed Ilyas Lakhal, Ozge Mercanoglu Sincan, Richard Bowden_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail, we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively. To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

- **[3D-R1: Enhancing Reasoning in 3D VLMs for Unified Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23478)**  `arXiv:2507.23478`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ting Huang, Zeyu Zhang, Hao Tang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of 3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1. Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10% across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding.

- **[Short-LVLM: Compressing and Accelerating Large Vision-Language Models by Pruning Redundant Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23362)**  `arXiv:2507.23362`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ji Ma, Wei Suo, Peng Wang, Yanning Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights, we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[UniLiP: Adapting CLIP for Unified Multimodal Understanding, Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23278)**  `arXiv:2507.23278`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hao Tang, Chenwei Xie, Xiaoyi Bao, Tingyu Weng, Pandeng Li, Yun Zheng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction, generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or degradation of original comprehensionthis http URLcontrast, we introduce a two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain original comprehension performance while achieving effective image reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks, UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life, ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks; and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model adaptation.

- **[Towards Omnimodal Expressions and Reasoning in Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22886)**  `arXiv:2507.22886`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kaining Ying, Henghui Ding, Guangquan Jie, Yu-Gang Jiang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Referring audio-visual segmentation (RAVS) has recently seen significant advancements, yet challenges remain in integrating multimodal information and deeply understanding and reasoning about audiovisual content. To extend the boundaries of RAVS and facilitate future research in this field, we propose Omnimodal Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (OmniAVS), a new dataset containing 2,104 videos and 61,095 multimodal referring expressions. OmniAVS stands out with three key innovations: (1) 8 types of multimodal expressions that flexibly combine text, speech, sound, and visual cues; (2) an emphasis on understanding audio content beyond just detecting their presence; and (3) the inclusion of complex reasoning and world knowledge in expressions. Furthermore, we introduce Omnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant (OISA), to address the challenges of multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding of audiovisual content in OmniAVS. OISA uses MLLM to comprehend complex cues and perform reasoning-based segmentation. Extensive experiments show that OISA outperforms existing methods on OmniAVS and achieves competitive results on other related tasks.

- **[TARS: MinMax Token-Adaptive Preference Strategy for Hallucination Reduction in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21584)**  `arXiv:2507.21584`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kejia Zhang, Keda Tao, Zhiming Luo, Chang Liu, Jiasheng Tang, Huan Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning, yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations. This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning. We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback, TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on several key metrics.

- **[Detecting Visual Information Manipulation Attacks in Augmented Reality: A Multimodal Semantic Reasoning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20356)**  `arXiv:2507.20356`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yanming Xiu, Maria Gorlatova_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes: information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information. Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM. It consists of 452 raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world AR scenario. To detect such attacks, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only and text-only baselines. The system reaches an average attack detection latency of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.

  _Haiquan Wen, Tianxiao Li, Zhenglin Huang, Yiwei He, Guangliang Cheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved image and video synthesis capabilities, significantly increasing the risk of misinformation through sophisticated fake content. In response, detection methods have evolved from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately, making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning (RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fire detection in dynamic environments faces continuous challenges, including the interference of illumination changes, many false detections or missed detections, and it is difficult to achieve both efficiency and accuracy. To address the problem of feature extraction limitation and information loss in the existing YOLO-based models, this study propose You Only Look Once for Fire Detection with Attention-guided Inverted Residual and Dual-pooling Downscale Fusion (YOLO-FireAD) with two core innovations: (1) Attention-guided Inverted Residual Block (AIR) integrates hybrid channel-spatial attention with inverted residuals to adaptively enhance fire features and suppress environmental noise; (2) Dual Pool Downscale Fusion Block (DPDF) preserves multi-scale fire patterns through learnable fusion of max-average pooling outputs, mitigating small-fire detection failures. Extensive evaluation on two public datasets shows the efficient performance of our model. Our proposed model keeps the sum amount of parameters (1.45M, 51.8% lower than YOLOv8n) (4.6G, 43.2% lower than YOLOv8n), and mAP75 is higher than the mainstream real-time object detection models YOLOv8n, YOL-Ov9t, YOLOv10n, YOLO11n, YOLOv12n and other YOLOv8 variants 1.3-5.5%.

  Language-specific neurons in LLMs that strongly correlate with individual languages have been shown to influence model behavior by deactivating them. However, their role in amplification remains underexplored. This work investigates the effect of amplifying language-specific neurons through interventions across 18 languages, including low-resource ones, using three models primarily trained in different languages. We compare amplification factors by their effectiveness in steering to the target language using a proposed Language Steering Shift (LSS) evaluation score, then evaluate it on downstream tasks: commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XWinograd), knowledge (Include), and translation (FLORES). The optimal amplification factors effectively steer output toward nearly all tested languages. Intervention using this factor on downstream tasks improves self-language performance in some cases but generally degrades cross-language results. These findings highlight the effect of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, where amplification can be beneficial especially for low-resource languages, but provides limited advantage for cross-lingual transfer.

  Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis. Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs' hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

  The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia. As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs, aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13 advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only 21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally, we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios. Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

  We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers. This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality, coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and (3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA. Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

  Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining. Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information systems.

  Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting. Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed. Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting method.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents. While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer. During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient, layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations. We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue scenarios.

  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural language reasoning tasks, yet their reasoning processes remain brittle and difficult to interpret. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enhance reliability by eliciting intermediate reasoning steps or aggregating multiple outputs. However, they lack mechanisms for enforcing logical structure and assessing internal coherence. We introduce Theorem-of-Thought (ToTh), a novel framework that models reasoning as collaboration among three parallel agents, each simulating a distinct mode of inference: abductive, deductive, and inductive. Each agent produces a reasoning trace, which is structured into a formal reasoning graph. To evaluate consistency, we apply Bayesian belief propagation guided by natural language inference (NLI), assigning confidence scores to each step. The most coherent graph is selected to derive the final answer. Experiments on symbolic (WebOfLies) and numerical (MultiArith) reasoning benchmarks show that ToTh consistently outperforms CoT, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding across multiple LLMs, while producing interpretable and logically grounded reasoning chains. Our findings suggest a promising direction for building more robust and cognitively inspired LLM reasoning. The implementation is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families. Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.

  In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance. Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented **R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation, we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by 3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.

  Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs. However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g., pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii) We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly disrupted by SE pruning.

  There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to the other two LLMs.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial. However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce \textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark, emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and efficient RAG systems. Our code is available inthis https URL.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose PAPO, a novel policy gradient algorithm that encourages the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason. Specifically, we introduce the Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term, which can be seamlessly plugged into mainstream RLVR algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation, reward models, or stronger teacher models. To further enhance the training stability of PAPO, we introduce the Double Entropy Loss, which effectively regularizes the new KL objective without compromising performance. Despite its simplicity, PAPO yields significant overall improvements of 4.4%-17.5% on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more pronounced, approaching 8.0%-19.1%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also observe a substantial reduction of 30.5% in perception errors, indicating improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. Overall, our work introduces a deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into core learning objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages visually grounded reasoning. Code and data will be made publicly available for research purposes. Project page:this https URL.

  Current large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emerging capabilities in social intelligence tasks, including implicature resolution and theory-of-mind reasoning, both of which require substantial pragmatic understanding. However, how LLMs acquire this pragmatic competence throughout the training process remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce ALTPRAG, a dataset grounded in the pragmatic concept of alternatives, to evaluate whether LLMs at different training stages can accurately infer nuanced speaker intentions. Each instance pairs two equally plausible yet pragmatically divergent continuations and requires the model to (i) infer the speaker's intended meaning and (ii) explain when and why a speaker would choose one utterance over its alternative, thus directly probing pragmatic competence through contrastive reasoning. We systematically evaluate 22 LLMs across 3 key training stages: after pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference optimization, to examine the development of pragmatic competence. Our results show that even base models exhibit notable sensitivity to pragmatic cues, which improves consistently with increases in model and data scale. Additionally, SFT and RLHF contribute further gains, particularly in cognitive-pragmatic scenarios. These findings highlight pragmatic competence as an emergent and compositional property of LLM training and offer new insights for aligning models with human communicative norms.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various tasks, including solving math word problems (MWPs), but struggle with real-world problems containing irrelevant information. To address this, we propose a prompting framework that generates adversarial variants of MWPs by adding irrelevant variables. We introduce a dataset, PROBLEMATHIC, containing both adversarial and non-adversarial MWPs. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are susceptible to distraction by numerical noise, resulting in an average relative performance drop of ~26% on adversarial MWPs. To mitigate this, we fine-tune LLMs (Llama-2, Mistral) on the adversarial samples from our dataset. Fine-tuning on adversarial training instances improves performance on adversarial MWPs by ~8%, indicating increased robustness to noise and improved ability to identify relevant data for reasoning. Finally, to assess the generalizability of our prompting framework, we introduce GSM-8K-Adv, an adversarial variant of the GSM-8K benchmark. LLMs continue to struggle when faced with adversarial information, reducing performance by up to 6%.

  AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from 0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA, a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a research demo for public testing.

In verifiable reasoning, our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as s1k and OpenMathReasoning, across MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond.

  LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose \textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning. Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F, and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long chain-of-thought reasoning.

  Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release TextQuests atthis https URL.

  Agents built on LLMs are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, automating complex decision-making and task execution. However, their autonomy introduces safety risks, including security vulnerabilities, legal violations, and unintended harmful actions. Existing mitigation methods, such as model-based safeguards and early enforcement strategies, fall short in robustness, interpretability, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose AgentSpec, a lightweight domain-specific language for specifying and enforcing runtime constraints on LLM agents. With AgentSpec, users define structured rules that incorporate triggers, predicates, and enforcement mechanisms, ensuring agents operate within predefined safety boundaries. We implement AgentSpec across multiple domains, including code execution, embodied agents, and autonomous driving, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that AgentSpec successfully prevents unsafe executions in over 90% of code agent cases, eliminates all hazardous actions in embodied agent tasks, and enforces 100% compliance by autonomous vehicles (AVs). Despite its strong safety guarantees, AgentSpec remains computationally lightweight, with overheads in milliseconds. By combining interpretability, modularity, and efficiency, AgentSpec provides a practical and scalable solution for enforcing LLM agent safety across diverse applications. We also automate the generation of rules using LLMs and assess their effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that the rules generated by OpenAI o1 achieve a precision of 95.56% and recall of 70.96% for embodied agents, successfully identify 87.26% of the risky code, and prevent AVs from breaking laws in 5 out of 8 scenarios.

  Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL), have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks. However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance. Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient LLM agents.

  Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform. Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail, we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25 dataset.

  Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model (LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before obtaining group forecasting predictions.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy, they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation (KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions, establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness and capability in MLLMs.

  Large reasoning models (e.g., R1, o3) have demonstrated remarkable mathematical problem-solving abilities. However, the high reported accuracy of these advanced models on popular datasets, reliance on purely numerical evaluation and potential benchmark leakage, often masks their true reasoning shortcomings. To address this, we propose leveraging the inherent rigor and methodological complexity of mathematical proofs as a diagnostic tool to expose these hidden failures. Specifically, we introduce the RFMDataset (Reveal Failure Modes), a collection of 200 diverse mathematical proof problems, and thoroughly evaluate advanced models' performance on it. Our in-depth analysis of their failures uncovers 10 fine-grained error types, which shows fundamental limitations in current large reasoning models: 1) large reasoning models grapple profoundly with mathematical proofs, with some generating entirely correct proofs for less than 20% of problems and failing even on basic ones; 2) models exhibit a diverse spectrum of reasoning failures, prominently demonstrating the lack of guarantees for the correctness and rigor of single-step reasoning; and 3) models show hallucination and incompleteness during the reasoning process. Our findings reveal that models' self-reflection is insufficient to resolve the current logical dilemmas, necessitating formalized and fine-grained logical training.

  Alpha factor mining is pivotal in quantitative investment for identifying predictive signals from complex financial data. While traditional formulaic alpha mining relies on human expertise, contemporary automated methods, such as those based on genetic programming or reinforcement learning, often struggle with search inefficiency or yield alpha factors that are difficult to interpret. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to overcome these limitations. Our framework leverages the LLM's instruction-following and reasoning capability to iteratively generate and refine symbolic alpha formulas within an MCTS-driven exploration. A key innovation is the guidance of MCTS exploration by rich, quantitative feedback from financial backtesting of each candidate factor, enabling efficient navigation of the vast search space. Furthermore, a frequent subtree avoidance mechanism is introduced to enhance search diversity and prevent formulaic homogenization, further improving performance. Experimental results on real-world stock market data demonstrate that our LLM-based framework outperforms existing methods by mining alphas with superior predictive accuracy and trading performance. The resulting formulas are also more amenable to human interpretation, establishing a more effective and efficient paradigm for formulaic alpha mining.
