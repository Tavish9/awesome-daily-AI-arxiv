- **[From Seeing to Doing: Bridging Reasoning and Decision for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08548)**  `arXiv:2505.08548`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  Achieving generalization in robotic manipulation remains a critical challenge, particularly for unseen scenarios and novel tasks. Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, while building on top of general Vision-Language Models (VLMs), still fall short of achieving robust zero-shot performance due to the scarcity and heterogeneity prevalent in embodied datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FSD (From Seeing to Doing), a novel vision-language model that generates intermediate representations through spatial relationship reasoning, providing fine-grained guidance for robotic manipulation. Our approach combines a hierarchical data pipeline for training with a self-consistency mechanism that aligns spatial coordinates with visual signals. Through extensive experiments, we comprehensively validated FSD's capabilities in both "seeing" and "doing," achieving outstanding performance across 8 benchmarks for general spatial reasoning and embodied reference abilities, as well as on our proposed more challenging benchmark VABench. We also verified zero-shot capabilities in robot manipulation, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods in both SimplerEnv and real robot settings. Experimental results show that FSD achieves 54.1% success rate in SimplerEnv and 72% success rate across 8 real-world tasks, outperforming the strongest baseline by 30%.

- **[End-to-End Multi-Task Policy Learning from NMPC for Quadruped Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08574)**  `arXiv:2505.08574`  `cs.RO`  
  _Anudeep Sajja, Shahram Khorshidi, Sebastian Houben, Maren Bennewitz_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quadruped robots excel in traversing complex, unstructured environments where wheeled robots often fail. However, enabling efficient and adaptable locomotion remains challenging due to the quadrupeds' nonlinear dynamics, high degrees of freedom, and the computational demands of real-time control. Optimization-based controllers, such as Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), have shown strong performance, but their reliance on accurate state estimation and high computational overhead makes deployment in real-world settings challenging. In this work, we present a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework in which expert NMPC demonstrations are used to train a single neural network to predict actions for multiple locomotion behaviors directly from raw proprioceptive sensor inputs. We evaluate our approach extensively on the quadruped robot Go1, both in simulation and on real hardware, demonstrating that it accurately reproduces expert behavior, allows smooth gait switching, and simplifies the control pipeline for real-time deployment. Our MTL architecture enables learning diverse gaits within a unified policy, achieving high $R^{2}$ scores for predicted joint targets across all tasks.

By leveraging the diverse capabilities and roles of individual agents, multi-agent systems can tackle complex tasks through agent collaboration. We discuss optimizing task allocation, fostering robust reasoning through iterative debates, managing complex and layered context information, and enhancing memory management to support the intricate interactions within multi-agent systems. We also explore potential applications of multi-agent systems in blockchain systems to shed light on their future development and application in real-world distributed systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have become pivotal in artificial intelligence, demonstrating strong capabilities in reasoning, understanding, and generating data. However, their deployment on edge devices is hindered by their substantial size, often reaching several billion parameters. Quantization is a widely used method to reduce memory usage and inference time, however LLMs present unique challenges due to the prevalence of outliers in their activations. In this work, we leverage the theoretical advantages of Hadamard matrices over random rotation matrices to push the boundaries of quantization in LLMs. We demonstrate that Hadamard matrices are more effective in reducing outliers, which are a significant obstacle in achieving low-bit quantization. Our method based on a gradual binary search enables 3-bit quantization for weights, activations, and key-value (KV) caches, resulting in a 40% increase in accuracy on common benchmarks compared to SoTA methods. We extend the use of rotation matrices to support non-power-of-2 embedding dimensions, similar to the Qwen architecture, by employing the Paley algorithm. We theoretically demonstrates the superiority of Hadamard matrices in reducingthis http URLachieved 3-bit quantization for weights, activations, and KV cache, significantly enhancing model performance. Our experimental results on multiple models family like Mistral, LLaMA, and Qwen demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming existing methods and enabling practical 3-bit quantization.

- **[DSADF: Thinking Fast and Slow for Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08189)**  `arXiv:2505.08189`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are effective in well-defined environments, they often struggle to generalize their learned policies to dynamic settings due to their reliance on trial-and-error interactions. Recent work has explored applying Large Language Models (LLMs) or Vision Language Models (VLMs) to boost the generalization of RL agents through policy optimization guidance or prior knowledge. However, these approaches often lack seamless coordination between the RL agent and the foundation model, leading to unreasonable decision-making in unfamiliar environments and efficiency bottlenecks. Making full use of the inferential capabilities of foundation models and the rapid response capabilities of RL agents and enhancing the interaction between the two to form a dual system is still a lingering scientific question. To address this problem, we draw inspiration from Kahneman's theory of fast thinking (System 1) and slow thinking (System 2), demonstrating that balancing intuition and deep reasoning can achieve nimble decision-making in a complex world. In this study, we propose a Dual-System Adaptive Decision Framework (DSADF), integrating two complementary modules: System 1, comprising an RL agent and a memory space for fast and intuitive decision making, and System 2, driven by a VLM for deep and analytical reasoning. DSADF facilitates efficient and adaptive decision-making by combining the strengths of both systems. The empirical study in the video game environment: Crafter and Housekeep demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method, showing significant improvements in decision abilities for both unseen and known tasks.

- **[Prototype Augmented Hypernetworks for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07450)**  `arXiv:2505.07450`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Neil De La Fuente, Maria Pilligua, Daniel Vidal, Albin Soutiff, Cecilia Curreli, Daniel Cremers, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning (CL) aims to learn a sequence of tasks without forgetting prior knowledge, but gradient updates for a new task often overwrite the weights learned earlier, causing catastrophic forgetting (CF). We propose Prototype-Augmented Hypernetworks (PAH), a framework where a single hypernetwork, conditioned on learnable task prototypes, dynamically generates task-specific classifier heads on demand. To mitigate forgetting, PAH combines cross-entropy with dual distillation losses, one to align logits and another to align prototypes, ensuring stable feature representations across tasks. Evaluations on Split-CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet demonstrate that PAH achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 74.5 % and 63.7 % accuracy with only 1.7 % and 4.4 % forgetting, respectively, surpassing prior methods without storing samples or heads.

- **[InfoPO: On Mutual Information Maximization for Large Language Model Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08507)**  `arXiv:2505.08507`  `cs.LG`  
  _Teng Xiao, Zhen Ge, Sujay Sanghavi, Tian Wang, Julian Katz-Samuels, Marc Versage, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the post-training of large language models (LLMs) with human preference data. Recently, direct preference optimization and its variants have shown considerable promise in aligning language models, eliminating the need for reward models and online sampling. Despite these benefits, these methods rely on explicit assumptions about the Bradley-Terry (BT) model, which makes them prone to overfitting and results in suboptimal performance, particularly on reasoning-heavy tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a principled preference fine-tuning algorithm called InfoPO, which effectively and efficiently aligns large language models using preference data. InfoPO eliminates the reliance on the BT model and prevents the likelihood of the chosen response from decreasing. Extensive experiments confirm that InfoPO consistently outperforms established baselines on widely used open benchmarks, particularly in reasoning tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Compared to image-text pair data, interleaved corpora enable Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand the world more naturally like humans. However, such existing datasets are crawled from webpage, facing challenges like low knowledge density, loose image-text relations, and poor logical coherence between images. On the other hand, the internet hosts vast instructional videos (e.g., online geometry courses) that are widely used by humans to learn foundational subjects, yet these valuable resources remain underexplored in VLM training. In this paper, we introduce a high-quality \textbf{multimodal textbook} corpus with richer foundational knowledge for VLM pretraining. It collects over 2.5 years of instructional videos, totaling 22,000 class hours. We first use an LLM-proposed taxonomy to systematically gather instructional videos. Then we progressively extract and refine visual (keyframes), audio (ASR), and textual knowledge (OCR) from the videos, and organize as an image-text interleaved corpus based on temporal order. Compared to its counterparts, our video-centric textbook offers more coherent context, richer knowledge, and better image-text alignment. Experiments demonstrate its superb pretraining performance, particularly in knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks like ScienceQA and MathVista. Moreover, VLMs pre-trained on our textbook exhibit outstanding interleaved context awareness, leveraging visual and textual cues in their few-shot context for task solving.

- **[SeriesBench: A Benchmark for Narrative-Driven Drama Series Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21435)**  `arXiv:2504.21435`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid development of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), an increasing number of benchmarks have been established to evaluate the video understanding capabilities of these models. However, these benchmarks focus on standalone videos and mainly assess "visual elements" like human actions and object states. In reality, contemporary videos often encompass complex and continuous narratives, typically presented as a series. To address this challenge, we propose SeriesBench, a benchmark consisting of 105 carefully curated narrative-driven series, covering 28 specialized tasks that require deep narrative understanding. Specifically, we first select a diverse set of drama series spanning various genres. Then, we introduce a novel long-span narrative annotation method, combined with a full-information transformation approach to convert manual annotations into diverse task formats. To further enhance model capacity for detailed analysis of plot structures and character relationships within series, we propose a novel narrative reasoning framework, PC-DCoT. Extensive results on SeriesBench indicate that existing MLLMs still face significant challenges in understanding narrative-driven series, while PC-DCoT enables these MLLMs to achieve performance improvements. Overall, our SeriesBench and PC-DCoT highlight the critical necessity of advancing model capabilities to understand narrative-driven series, guiding the future development of MLLMs. SeriesBench is publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[Towards Autonomous UAV Visual Object Search in City Space: Benchmark and Agentic Methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08765)**  `arXiv:2505.08765`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yatai Ji, Zhengqiu Zhu, Yong Zhao, Beidan Liu, Chen Gao, Yihao Zhao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aerial Visual Object Search (AVOS) tasks in urban environments require Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to autonomously search for and identify target objects using visual and textual cues without external guidance. Existing approaches struggle in complex urban environments due to redundant semantic processing, similar object distinction, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To bridge this gap and support the AVOS task, we introduce CityAVOS, the first benchmark dataset for autonomous search of common urban objects. This dataset comprises 2,420 tasks across six object categories with varying difficulty levels, enabling comprehensive evaluation of UAV agents' search capabilities. To solve the AVOS tasks, we also propose PRPSearcher (Perception-Reasoning-Planning Searcher), a novel agentic method powered by multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that mimics human three-tier cognition. Specifically, PRPSearcher constructs three specialized maps: an object-centric dynamic semantic map enhancing spatial perception, a 3D cognitive map based on semantic attraction values for target reasoning, and a 3D uncertainty map for balanced exploration-exploitation search. Also, our approach incorporates a denoising mechanism to mitigate interference from similar objects and utilizes an Inspiration Promote Thought (IPT) prompting mechanism for adaptive action planning. Experimental results on CityAVOS demonstrate that PRPSearcher surpasses existing baselines in both success rate and search efficiency (on average: +37.69% SR, +28.96% SPL, -30.69% MSS, and -46.40% NE). While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights the need for better semantic reasoning and spatial exploration capabilities in AVOS tasks. This work establishes a foundation for future advances in embodied target search. Dataset and source code are available atthis https URL.

- **[Extending Large Vision-Language Model for Diverse Interactive Tasks in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08725)**  `arXiv:2505.08725`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zongchuang Zhao, Haoyu Fu, Dingkang Liang, Xin Zhou, Dingyuan Zhang, Hongwei Xie, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced image understanding. Their comprehension and reasoning capabilities enable promising applications in autonomous driving scenarios. However, existing research typically focuses on front-view perspectives and partial objects within scenes, struggling to achieve comprehensive scene understanding. Meanwhile, existing LVLMs suffer from the lack of mapping relationship between 2D and 3D and insufficient integration of 3D object localization and instruction understanding. To tackle these limitations, we first introduce NuInteract, a large-scale dataset with over 1.5M multi-view image language pairs spanning dense scene captions and diverse interactive tasks. Furthermore, we propose DriveMonkey, a simple yet effective framework that seamlessly integrates LVLMs with a spatial processor using a series of learnable queries. The spatial processor, designed as a plug-and-play component, can be initialized with pre-trained 3D detectors to improve 3D perception. Our experiments show that DriveMonkey outperforms general LVLMs, especially achieving a 9.86% notable improvement on the 3D visual grounding task. The dataset and code will be released atthis https URL.

- **[OpenThinkIMG: Learning to Think with Images via Visual Tool Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08617)**  `arXiv:2505.08617`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhaochen Su, Linjie Li, Mingyang Song, Yunzhuo Hao, Zhengyuan Yang, Jun Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While humans can flexibly leverage interactive visual cognition for complex problem-solving, enabling Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to learn similarly adaptive behaviors with visual tools remains challenging. A significant hurdle is the current lack of standardized infrastructure, which hinders integrating diverse tools, generating rich interaction data, and training robust agents effectively. To address these gaps, we introduce OpenThinkIMG, the first open-source, comprehensive end-to-end framework for tool-augmented LVLMs. It features standardized vision tool interfaces, scalable trajectory generation for policy initialization, and a flexible training environment. Furthermore, considering supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on static demonstrations offers limited policy generalization for dynamic tool invocation, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework V-ToolRL to train LVLMs to learn adaptive policies for invoking external vision tools. V-ToolRL enables LVLMs to autonomously discover optimal tool-usage strategies by directly optimizing for task success using feedback from tool interactions. We empirically validate V-ToolRL on challenging chart reasoning tasks. Our RL-trained agent, built upon a Qwen2-VL-2B, significantly outperforms its SFT-initialized counterpart (+28.83 points) and surpasses established supervised tool-learning baselines like Taco and CogCom by an average of +12.7 points. Notably, it also surpasses prominent closed-source models like GPT-4.1 by +8.68 accuracy points. We hope OpenThinkIMG can serve as a foundational framework for advancing dynamic, tool-augmented visual reasoning, helping the community develop AI agents that can genuinely "think with images".

- **[VCRBench: Exploring Long-form Causal Reasoning Capabilities of Large Video Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08455)**  `arXiv:2505.08455`  `cs.CV`  
  _Pritam Sarkar, Ali Etemad_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite recent advances in video understanding, the capabilities of Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) to perform video-based causal reasoning remains underexplored, largely due to the absence of relevant and dedicated benchmarks for evaluating causal reasoning in visually grounded and goal-driven settings. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark named Video-based long-form Causal Reasoning (VCRBench). We create VCRBench using procedural videos of simple everyday activities, where the steps are deliberately shuffled with each clip capturing a key causal event, to test whether LVLMs can identify, reason about, and correctly sequence the events needed to accomplish a specific goal. Moreover, the benchmark is carefully designed to prevent LVLMs from exploiting linguistic shortcuts, as seen in multiple-choice or binary QA formats, while also avoiding the challenges associated with evaluating open-ended QA. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs on VCRBench suggests that these models struggle with video-based long-form causal reasoning, primarily due to their difficulty in modeling long-range causal dependencies directly from visual observations. As a simple step toward enabling such capabilities, we propose Recognition-Reasoning Decomposition (RRD), a modular approach that breaks video-based causal reasoning into two sub-tasks of video recognition and causal reasoning. Our experiments on VCRBench show that RRD significantly boosts accuracy on VCRBench, with gains of up to 25.2%. Finally, our thorough analysis reveals interesting insights, for instance, that LVLMs primarily rely on language knowledge for complex video-based long-form causal reasoning tasks.

- **[Visually Interpretable Subtask Reasoning for Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08084)**  `arXiv:2505.08084`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yu Cheng, Arushi Goel, Hakan Bilen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Answering complex visual questions like `Which red furniture can be used for sitting?' requires multi-step reasoning, including object recognition, attribute filtering, and relational understanding. Recent work improves interpretability in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by decomposing tasks into sub-task programs, but these methods are computationally expensive and less accurate due to poor adaptation to target data. To address this, we introduce VISTAR (Visually Interpretable Subtask-Aware Reasoning Model), a subtask-driven training framework that enhances both interpretability and reasoning by generating textual and visual explanations within MLLMs. Instead of relying on external models, VISTAR fine-tunes MLLMs to produce structured Subtask-of-Thought rationales (step-by-step reasoning sequences). Experiments on two benchmarks show that VISTAR consistently improves reasoning accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Our code and dataset will be available atthis https URL.

  _Aybora Koksal, A. Aydin Alatan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating text-image content have been demonstrated by recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, their effectiveness in specialized domains-particularly those requiring resource-efficient and domain-specific adaptations-has remained limited. In this work, a lightweight multimodal language model termed MilChat is introduced, specifically adapted to analyze remote sensing imagery in secluded areas, including challenging missile launch sites. A new dataset, MilData, was compiled by verifying hundreds of aerial images through expert review, and subtle military installations were highlighted via detailed captions. Supervised fine-tuning on a 2B-parameter open-source MLLM with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning annotations was performed, enabling more accurate and interpretable explanations. Additionally, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was leveraged to enhance the model's ability to detect critical domain-specific cues-such as defensive layouts and key military structures-while minimizing false positives on civilian scenes. Through empirical evaluations, it has been shown that MilChat significantly outperforms both larger, general-purpose multimodal models and existing remote sensing-adapted approaches on open-ended captioning and classification metrics. Over 80% recall and 98% precision were achieved on the newly proposed MilData benchmark, underscoring the potency of targeted fine-tuning and reinforcement learning in specialized real-world applications.

  _Zhikai Wang, Jiashuo Sun, Wenqi Zhang, Zhiqiang Hu, Xin Li, Fan Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to integrate visual and linguistic information, achieving near-human proficiency in tasks like object recognition, captioning, and visual question answering. However, current benchmarks typically focus on knowledge-centric evaluations that assess domain-specific expertise, often neglecting the core ability to reason about fundamental mathematical elements and visual concepts. We identify a gap in evaluating elementary-level math problems, which rely on explicit visual dependencies-requiring models to discern, integrate, and reason across multiple images while incorporating commonsense knowledge, all of which are crucial for advancing toward broader AGI capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VCBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal mathematical reasoning with explicit visual dependencies. VCBENCH includes 1,720 problems across six cognitive domains, featuring 6,697 images (averaging 3.9 per question) to ensure multi-image reasoning. We evaluate 26 state-of-the-art LVLMs on VCBENCH, revealing substantial performance disparities, with even the top models unable to exceed 50% accuracy. Our findings highlight the ongoing challenges in visual-mathematical integration and suggest avenues for future LVLM advancements. The project can be found atthis https URL.

  _Xiao An, Jiaxing Sun, Zihan Gui, Wei He_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), both general-domain models and those specifically tailored for remote sensing, has demonstrated exceptional perception and reasoning capabilities in Earth observation tasks. However, a benchmark for systematically evaluating their capabilities in this domain is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we propose CHOICE, an extensive benchmark designed to objectively evaluate the hierarchical remote sensing capabilities of VLMs. Focusing on 2 primary capability dimensions essential to remote sensing: perception and reasoning, we further categorize 6 secondary dimensions and 23 leaf tasks to ensure a well-rounded assessment coverage. CHOICE guarantees the quality of all 10,507 problems through a rigorous process of data collection from 50 globally distributed cities, question construction and quality control. The newly curated data and the format of multiple-choice questions with definitive answers allow for an objective and straightforward performance assessment. Our evaluation of 3 proprietary and 21 open-source VLMs highlights their critical limitations within this specialized context. We hope that CHOICE will serve as a valuable resource and offer deeper insights into the challenges and potential of VLMs in the field of remote sensing. We will release CHOICE atthis https URL.

- **[Judging the Judges: Can Large Vision-Language Models Fairly Evaluate Chart Comprehension and Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08468)**  `arXiv:2505.08468`  `cs.CL` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Charts are ubiquitous as they help people understand and reason with data. Recently, various downstream tasks, such as chart question answering, chart2text, and fact-checking, have emerged. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise in tackling these tasks, but their evaluation is costly and time-consuming, limiting real-world deployment. While using LVLMs as judges to assess the chart comprehension capabilities of other LVLMs could streamline evaluation processes, challenges like proprietary datasets, restricted access to powerful models, and evaluation costs hinder their adoption in industrial settings. To this end, we present a comprehensive evaluation of 13 open-source LVLMs as judges for diverse chart comprehension and reasoning tasks. We design both pairwise and pointwise evaluation tasks covering criteria like factual correctness, informativeness, and relevancy. Additionally, we analyze LVLM judges based on format adherence, positional consistency, length bias, and instruction-following. We focus on cost-effective LVLMs (<10B parameters) suitable for both research and commercial use, following a standardized evaluation protocol and rubric to measure the LVLM judge's accuracy. Experimental results reveal notable variability: while some open LVLM judges achieve GPT-4-level evaluation performance (about 80% agreement with GPT-4 judgments), others struggle (below ~10% agreement). Our findings highlight that state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs can serve as cost-effective automatic evaluators for chart-related tasks, though biases such as positional preference and length bias persist.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Due to long generations, large language model (LLM) math reasoning demands significant computational resources and time. While many existing efficient inference methods have been developed with excellent performance preservation on language tasks, they often severely degrade math performance. In this paper, we propose Caprese, a low-cost distillation method to recover lost capabilities from deploying efficient inference methods, focused primarily in feedforward blocks. With original weights unperturbed, roughly 1% of additional parameters, and only 20K synthetic training samples, we are able to recover much if not all of the math capabilities lost from efficient inference for thinking LLMs and without harm to language tasks for instruct LLMs. Moreover, Caprese slashes the number of active parameters (~2B cut for Gemma 2 9B and Llama 3.1 8B) and integrates cleanly into existing model layers to reduce latency (>11% reduction to generate 2048 tokens with Qwen 2.5 14B) while encouraging response brevity.

  _Daniel Franzen, Jan Disselhoff, David Hartmann_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), exposing limitations in their abstract reasoning abilities. In this work, we leverage task-specific data augmentations throughout the training, generation, and scoring phases, and employ a depth-first search algorithm to generate diverse, high-probability candidate solutions. Furthermore, we utilize the LLM not only as a generator but also as a scorer, using its output probabilities to select the most promising solutions. Our method achieves a score of 71.6% (286.5/400 solved tasks) on the public ARC-AGI evaluation set, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance among publicly available approaches. While concurrent closed-source work has reported higher scores, our method distinguishes itself through its transparency, reproducibility, and remarkably low inference cost, averaging only around 2ct per task on readily available hardware (we assume a price of 36ct/hour for a Nvidia 4090 GPU).

- **[Enhancing Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) with Adaptive Contextual Compression for Scalable Knowledge Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08261)**  `arXiv:2505.08261`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Rishabh Agrawal, Himanshu Kumar_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for novel approaches in knowledge-intensive tasks. Among these, Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) has emerged as a promising alternative to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). CAG minimizes retrieval latency and simplifies system design by preloading knowledge into the model's context. However, challenges persist in scaling CAG to accommodate large and dynamic knowledge bases effectively. This paper introduces Adaptive Contextual Compression (ACC), an innovative technique designed to dynamically compress and manage context inputs, enabling efficient utilization of the extended memory capabilities of modern LLMs. To further address the limitations of standalone CAG, we propose a Hybrid CAG-RAG Framework, which integrates selective retrieval to augment preloaded contexts in scenarios requiring additional information. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse datasets highlight the proposed methods' ability to enhance scalability, optimize efficiency, and improve multi-hop reasoning performance, offering practical solutions for real-world knowledge integration challenges.

  The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has provided significant support and opportunities for the advancement of domain-specific LLMs. However, fine-tuning these large models using Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) data inevitably faces challenges such as bias, incorrect knowledge inheritance, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose a novel training method that integrates a bidirectional chains of thought and a reward mechanism. This method is built upon ICH-Qwen, a large language model specifically designed for the field of intangible cultural heritage. The proposed method enables the model to not only perform forward reasoning but also enhances the accuracy of the generated answers by utilizing reverse questioning and reverse reasoning to activate the model's latent knowledge. Additionally, a reward mechanism is introduced during training to optimize the decision-making process. This mechanism improves the quality of the model's outputs through structural and content evaluations with different weighting schemes. We conduct comparative experiments on ICH-Qwen, with results demonstrating that our method outperforms 0-shot, step-by-step reasoning, knowledge distillation, and question augmentation methods in terms of accuracy, Bleu-4, and Rouge-L scores on the question-answering task. Furthermore, the paper highlights the effectiveness of combining the bidirectional chains of thought and reward mechanism through ablation experiments. In addition, a series of generalizability experiments are conducted, with results showing that the proposed method yields improvements on various domain-specific datasets and advanced models in areas such as Finance, Wikidata, and StrategyQA. This demonstrates that the method is adaptable to multiple domains and provides a valuable approach for model training in future applications across diverse fields.

  One open question in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs) is whether they can emulate human ethical reasoning and act as believable proxies for human judgment. To investigate this, we introduce a benchmark dataset comprising 196 real-world ethical dilemmas and expert opinions, each segmented into five structured components: Introduction, Key Factors, Historical Theoretical Perspectives, Resolution Strategies, and Key Takeaways. We also collect non-expert human responses for comparison, limited to the Key Factors section due to their brevity. We evaluate multiple frontier LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Deepseek-V3, Gemini-1.5-Flash) using a composite metric framework based on BLEU, Damerau-Levenshtein distance, TF-IDF cosine similarity, and Universal Sentence Encoder similarity. Metric weights are computed through an inversion-based ranking alignment and pairwise AHP analysis, enabling fine-grained comparison of model outputs to expert responses. Our results show that LLMs generally outperform non-expert humans in lexical and structural alignment, with GPT-4o-mini performing most consistently across all sections. However, all models struggle with historical grounding and proposing nuanced resolution strategies, which require contextual abstraction. Human responses, while less structured, occasionally achieve comparable semantic similarity, suggesting intuitive moral reasoning. These findings highlight both the strengths and current limitations of LLMs in ethical decision-making.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safety alignment approaches in large language models (LLMs) often lead to the over-refusal of benign queries, significantly diminishing their utility in sensitive scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce FalseReject, a comprehensive resource containing 16k seemingly toxic queries accompanied by structured responses across 44 safety-related categories. We propose a graph-informed adversarial multi-agent interaction framework to generate diverse and complex prompts, while structuring responses with explicit reasoning to aid models in accurately distinguishing safe from unsafe contexts. FalseReject includes training datasets tailored for both standard instruction-tuned models and reasoning-oriented models, as well as a human-annotated benchmark test set. Our extensive benchmarking on 29 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals persistent over-refusal challenges. Empirical results demonstrate that supervised finetuning with FalseReject substantially reduces unnecessary refusals without compromising overall safety or general language capabilities.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated their capabilities not only in reasoning but also in invoking external tools, particularly search engines. However, teaching models to discern when to invoke search and when to rely on their internal knowledge remains a significant challenge. Existing reinforcement learning approaches often lead to redundant search behaviors, resulting in inefficiencies and over-cost. In this paper, we propose SEM, a novel post-training reinforcement learning framework that explicitly trains LLMs to optimize search usage. By constructing a balanced dataset combining MuSiQue and MMLU, we create scenarios where the model must learn to distinguish between questions it can answer directly and those requiring external retrieval. We design a structured reasoning template and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) to post-train the model's search behaviors. Our reward function encourages accurate answering without unnecessary search while promoting effective retrieval when needed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces redundant search operations while maintaining or improving answer accuracy across multiple challenging benchmarks. This framework advances the model's reasoning efficiency and extends its capability to judiciously leverage external knowledge.

  In the age of social media, the rapid spread of misinformation and rumors has led to the emergence of infodemics, where false information poses a significant threat to society. To combat this issue, we introduce TrumorGPT , a novel generative artificial intelligence solution designed for fact-checking in the health domain. TrumorGPT aims to distinguish "trumors", which are health-related rumors that turn out to be true, providing a crucial tool in differentiating between mere speculation and verified facts. This framework leverages a large language model (LLM) with few-shot learning for semantic health knowledge graph construction and semantic reasoning. TrumorGPT incorporates graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) to address the hallucination issue common in LLMs and the limitations of static training data. GraphRAG involves accessing and utilizing information from regularly updated semantic health knowledge graphs that consist of the latest medical news and health information, ensuring that fact-checking by TrumorGPT is based on the most recent data. Evaluating with extensive healthcare datasets, TrumorGPT demonstrates superior performance in fact-checking for public health claims. Its ability to effectively conduct fact-checking across various platforms marks a critical step forward in the fight against health-related misinformation, enhancing trust and accuracy in the digital information age.

  The escalating demand for efficient decoding in large language models (LLMs) is particularly critical for reasoning-intensive architectures like OpenAI-o3 and DeepSeek-R1, which depend on extended chain-of-thought reasoning. This study investigates speculative decoding techniques through dense LLM architectures to establish foundational insights for accelerating reasoning tasks. While speculative decoding methods leveraging parallel draft-verification cycles have emerged as promising acceleration techniques, the scaling laws governing decoding efficiency remain under-explored compared to conventional backbone LLMs developed through Pretraining->SFT->RLHF training paradigms. In this work, we discover Log-linear Scaling Laws (Theorem 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3) governing draft model acceptance rate (or decoding speed) across three dimensions: pretraining token volume, draft model capacity, and decoding batch size. Building on these laws, we achieve Scylla, which coordinates multi-dimensional scaling for popular LLMs (Llama2/3, Qwen2.5). Empirical validation shows Scylla achieves 1.5-2.2 higher acceptance rate than EAGLE2 and 0.3 higher than EAGLE3 at temperature T = 0, with peak performance gains on summarization and QA tasks (Figure 2). Industrial inference engine deployments demonstrate 2X decoding throughput improvements over EAGLE2 (Table 5), validating the transformative potential of systematic scaling for efficient LLM inference. Code will be released later.

  Resume screening is a critical yet time-intensive process in talent acquisition, requiring recruiters to analyze vast volume of job applications while remaining objective, accurate, and fair. With the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), their reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge bases demonstrate new opportunities to streamline and automate recruitment workflows. In this work, we propose a multi-agent framework for resume screening using LLMs to systematically process and evaluate resumes. The framework consists of four core agents, including a resume extractor, an evaluator, a summarizer, and a score formatter. To enhance the contextual relevance of candidate assessments, we integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) within the resume evaluator, allowing incorporation of external knowledge sources, such as industry-specific expertise, professional certifications, university rankings, and company-specific hiring criteria. This dynamic adaptation enables personalized recruitment, bridging the gap between AI automation and talent acquisition. We assess the effectiveness of our approach by comparing AI-generated scores with ratings provided by HR professionals on a dataset of anonymized online resumes. The findings highlight the potential of multi-agent RAG-LLM systems in automating resume screening, enabling more efficient and scalable hiring workflows.

  Scientific problem-solving involves synthesizing information while applying expert knowledge. We introduce CURIE, a scientific long-Context Understanding,Reasoning and Information Extraction benchmark to measure the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in scientific problem-solving and assisting scientists in realistic workflows. This benchmark introduces ten challenging tasks with a total of 580 problems and solution pairs curated by experts in six disciplines - materials science, condensed matter physics, quantum computing, geospatial analysis, biodiversity, and proteins - covering both experimental and theoretical work-flows in science. We evaluate a range of closed and open LLMs on tasks in CURIE which requires domain expertise, comprehension of long in-context information,and multi-step reasoning. While Gemini Flash 2.0 and Claude-3 show consistent high comprehension across domains, the popular GPT-4o and command-R+ fail dramatically on protein sequencing tasks. With the best performance at 32% there is much room for improvement for all models. We hope that insights gained from CURIE can guide the future development of LLMs in sciences.

  To reduce the need for human annotations, large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as judges of the quality of other candidate models. The performance of LLM judges is typically evaluated by measuring the correlation with human judgments on generative tasks such as summarization or machine translation. In contrast, we study LLM judges on mathematical reasoning tasks. These tasks require multi-step reasoning, and the correctness of their solutions is verifiable, enabling a more objective evaluation. We perform a detailed performance analysis and find that easy samples are easy to judge, and difficult samples are difficult to judge. Our analysis uncovers a strong correlation between judgment performance and the candidate model task performance, indicating that judges tend to favor higher-quality models even if their answer is incorrect. As a consequence, we test whether we can predict the behavior of LLM judges using simple features such as part-of-speech tags and find that we can correctly predict 70%-75% of judgments. We conclude this study by analyzing practical use cases, showing that LLM judges consistently detect the on-average better model but largely fail if we use them to improve task performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Actual causality (AC), a fundamental aspect of causal reasoning (CR), is responsible for attribution and responsibility assignment in real-world scenarios. However, existing LLM-based methods lack grounding in formal AC theory, resulting in limited interpretability. Therefore, we propose AC-Reason, a semi-formal reasoning framework that identifies causally relevant events within an AC scenario, infers the values of their formal causal factors (e.g., sufficiency, necessity, and normality), and answers AC queries via a theory-guided algorithm with explanations. While AC-Reason does not explicitly construct a causal graph, it operates over variables in the underlying causal structure to support principled reasoning. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce AC-Bench, a new benchmark built upon and substantially extending Big-Bench Hard Causal Judgment (BBH-CJ). AC-Bench comprises ~1K carefully annotated samples, each with detailed reasoning steps and focuses solely on actual causation. The case study shows that synthesized samples in AC-Bench present greater challenges for LLMs. Extensive experiments on BBH-CJ and AC-Bench show that AC-Reason consistently improves LLM performance over baselines. On BBH-CJ, all tested LLMs surpass the average human rater accuracy of 69.60%, with GPT-4 + AC-Reason achieving 75.04%. On AC-Bench, GPT-4 + AC-Reason again achieves the highest accuracy of 71.82%. AC-Bench further enables fine-grained analysis of reasoning faithfulness, revealing that only Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4o exhibit faithful reasoning, whereas GPT-4 tends to exploit shortcuts. Finally, our ablation study proves that integrating AC theory into LLMs is highly effective, with the proposed algorithm contributing the most significant performance gains.

Outperforming DeepSeek-R1 and rivaling leading Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models like Qwen3-235B-A22B and Seed1.5-Thinking, AM-Thinking-v1 achieves impressive scores of 85.3 on AIME 2024, 74.4 on AIME 2025, and 70.3 on LiveCodeBench, showcasing state-of-the-art mathematical and coding capabilities among open-source models of similar scale.Built entirely from the open-source Qwen2.5-32B base model and publicly available queries, AM-Thinking-v1 leverages a meticulously crafted post-training pipeline - combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning - to deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities. This work demonstrates that the open-source community can achieve high performance at the 32B scale, a practical sweet spot for deployment and fine-tuning. By striking a balance between top-tier performance and real-world usability, we hope AM-Thinking-v1 inspires further collaborative efforts to harness mid-scale models, pushing reasoning boundaries while keeping accessibility at the core of innovation.

  Biological protocols are fundamental to reproducible and safe life science research. While LLMs excel on general tasks, their systematic evaluation on these highly specialized, accuracy-critical, and inherently procedural texts remains limited. In this work, we present BioProBench, the first large-scale, integrated multi-task benchmark for biological protocol understanding and reasoning. While limited benchmarks have touched upon specific aspects like protocol QA, BioProBench provides a comprehensive suite of five core tasks: Protocol Question Answering, Step Ordering, Error Correction, Protocol Generation, and Protocol Reasoning, enabling a holistic evaluation of LLMs on procedural biological texts. Built upon 27K original protocols, it yields nearly 556K high-quality structured instances. We evaluate 12 mainstream open/closed-source LLMs on BioProBench. Experimental results reveal that while top models preform well on surface understanding tasks, struggle significantly with deep reasoning and structured generation tasks like ordering and generation. Furthermore, model comparisons reveal diverse performance: certain open-source models approach closed-source levels on some tasks, yet bio-specific small models lag behind general LLMs, indicating limitations on complex procedural content. Overall, our findings underscore that procedural reasoning within biological protocols represents a significant challenge for current LLMs. BioProBench serves as a standardized framework to diagnose these specific limitations and guide the development of AI systems better equipped for safely automating complex scientific procedures.

  _Letian Peng, Jingbo Shang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces Codified Profiles for role-playing, a novel approach that represents character logic as structured, executable functions for behavioral decision-making. Each profile defines a set of functions parse_by_scene(scene) that outputs a list of logic-grounded assertions triggered_statements, using both explicit control structures (e.g., if-then-else) and condition checks like check_condition(scene, question), where each question is a semantically meaningful prompt about the scene (e.g., "Is the character in danger?") discriminated by the role-playing LLM as true, false, or unknown. This explicit representation offers three key advantages over traditional prompt-based profiles, which append character descriptions directly into text prompts: (1) Persistence, by enforcing complete and consistent execution of character logic, rather than relying on the model's implicit reasoning; (2) Updatability, through systematic inspection and revision of behavioral logic, which is difficult to track or debug in prompt-only approaches; (3) Controllable Randomness, by supporting stochastic behavior directly within the logic, enabling fine-grained variability that prompting alone struggles to achieve. To validate these advantages, we introduce a new benchmark constructed from 83 characters and 5,141 scenes curated from Fandom, using NLI-based scoring to compare character responses against ground-truth actions. Our experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of codified profiles in improving persistence, updatability, and behavioral diversity. Notably, by offloading a significant portion of reasoning to preprocessing, codified profiles enable even 1B-parameter models to perform high-quality role-playing, providing a scalable and efficient foundation for local deployment of role-play agents.

  Although large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance on various complex reasoning benchmarks, the academic community still lacks an in-depth understanding of base model training processes and data quality. To address this, we construct a large-scale, difficulty-graded reasoning dataset containing approximately 3.34 million unique queries of varying difficulty levels and about 40 million distilled responses generated by multiple models over several passes. Leveraging pass rate and Coefficient of Variation (CV), we precisely select the most valuable training data to enhance reasoning capability. Notably, we observe a training pattern shift, indicating that reasoning-focused training based on base models requires higher learning rates for effective training. Using this carefully selected data, we significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of the base model, achieving a pass rate of 79.2\% on the AIME2024 mathematical reasoning benchmark. This result surpasses most current distilled models and closely approaches state-of-the-art performance. We provide detailed descriptions of our data processing, difficulty assessment, and training methodology, and have publicly released all datasets and methods to promote rapid progress in open-source long-reasoning LLMs. The dataset is available at: \href{this https URL}{this https URL}

  The LLMSR@XLLM25 formulates a low-resource structural reasoning task that challenges LLMs to generate interpretable, step-by-step rationales with minimal labeled data. We present Less is More, the third-place winning approach in the LLMSR@XLLM25, which focuses on structured reasoning from only 24 labeled examples. Our approach leverages a multi-agent framework with reverse-prompt induction, retrieval-augmented reasoning synthesis via GPT-4o, and dual-stage reward-guided filtering to distill high-quality supervision across three subtasks: question parsing, CoT parsing, and step-level verification. All modules are fine-tuned from Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct under a unified LoRA+ setup. By combining structure validation with reward filtering across few-shot and zero-shot prompts, our pipeline consistently improves structure reasoning quality. These results underscore the value of controllable data distillation in enhancing structured inference under low-resource constraints. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Large Reasoning Models like DeepSeek-R1 mark a fundamental shift in how LLMs approach complex problems. Instead of directly producing an answer for a given input, DeepSeek-R1 creates detailed multi-step reasoning chains, seemingly "thinking" about a problem before providing an answer. This reasoning process is publicly available to the user, creating endless opportunities for studying the reasoning behaviour of the model and opening up the field of Thoughtology. Starting from a taxonomy of DeepSeek-R1's basic building blocks of reasoning, our analyses on DeepSeek-R1 investigate the impact and controllability of thought length, management of long or confusing contexts, cultural and safety concerns, and the status of DeepSeek-R1 vis-√†-vis cognitive phenomena, such as human-like language processing and world modelling. Our findings paint a nuanced picture. Notably, we show DeepSeek-R1 has a 'sweet spot' of reasoning, where extra inference time can impair model performance. Furthermore, we find a tendency for DeepSeek-R1 to persistently ruminate on previously explored problem formulations, obstructing further exploration. We also note strong safety vulnerabilities of DeepSeek-R1 compared to its non-reasoning counterpart, which can also compromise safety-aligned LLMs.

  Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are digital records of patient information, often containing unstructured clinical text. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is essential in EHRs for extracting key medical entities like problems, tests, and treatments to support downstream clinical applications. This paper explores prompt-based medical entity recognition using large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, guided by various prompt engineering techniques, including zero-shot, few-shot, and an ensemble approach. Among all strategies, GPT-4o with prompt ensemble achieved the highest classification performance with an F1-score of 0.95 and recall of 0.98, outperforming DeepSeek-R1 on the task. The ensemble method improved reliability by aggregating outputs through embedding-based similarity and majority voting.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing adoption of agentic workflows across diverse domains brings a critical need to scalably and systematically evaluate the complex traces these systems generate. Current evaluation methods depend on manual, domain-specific human analysis of lengthy workflow traces - an approach that does not scale with the growing complexity and volume of agentic outputs. Error analysis in these settings is further complicated by the interplay of external tool outputs and language model reasoning, making it more challenging than traditional software debugging. In this work, we (1) articulate the need for robust and dynamic evaluation methods for agentic workflow traces, (2) introduce a formal taxonomy of error types encountered in agentic systems, and (3) present a set of 148 large human-annotated traces (TRAIL) constructed using this taxonomy and grounded in established agentic benchmarks. To ensure ecological validity, we curate traces from both single and multi-agent systems, focusing on real-world applications such as software engineering and open-world information retrieval. Our evaluations reveal that modern long context LLMs perform poorly at trace debugging, with the best Gemini-2.5-pro model scoring a mere 11% on TRAIL. Our dataset and code are made publicly available to support and accelerate future research in scalable evaluation for agentic workflows.

  To advance the mathematical proficiency of large language models (LLMs), the DeepMath team has launched an open-source initiative aimed at developing an open mathematical LLM and systematically evaluating its mathematical creativity. This paper represents the initial contribution of this initiative. While recent developments in mathematical LLMs have predominantly emphasized reasoning skills, as evidenced by benchmarks on elementary to undergraduate-level mathematical tasks, the creative capabilities of these models have received comparatively little attention, and evaluation datasets remain scarce. To address this gap, we propose an evaluation criteria for mathematical creativity and introduce DeepMath-Creative, a novel, high-quality benchmark comprising constructive problems across algebra, geometry, analysis, and other domains. We conduct a systematic evaluation of mainstream LLMs' creative problem-solving abilities using this dataset. Experimental results show that even under lenient scoring criteria -- emphasizing core solution components and disregarding minor inaccuracies, such as small logical gaps, incomplete justifications, or redundant explanations -- the best-performing model, O3 Mini, achieves merely 70% accuracy, primarily on basic undergraduate-level constructive tasks. Performance declines sharply on more complex problems, with models failing to provide substantive strategies for open problems. These findings suggest that, although current LLMs display a degree of constructive proficiency on familiar and lower-difficulty problems, such performance is likely attributable to the recombination of memorized patterns rather than authentic creative insight or novel synthesis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite impressive progress in areas like mathematical reasoning, large language models still face significant challenges in consistently solving complex problems. Drawing inspiration from key human learning strategies, we propose two novel strategies to enhance the capability of large language models to solve these complex problems. First, Adaptive Difficulty Curriculum Learning (ADCL) is a novel curriculum learning strategy that tackles the Difficulty Shift phenomenon (i.e., a model's perception of problem difficulty dynamically changes during training) by periodically re-estimating difficulty within upcoming data batches to maintain alignment with the model's evolving capabilities. Second, Expert-Guided Self-Reformulation (EGSR) is a novel reinforcement learning strategy that bridges the gap between imitation learning and pure exploration by guiding models to reformulate expert solutions within their own conceptual framework, rather than relying on direct imitation, fostering deeper understanding and knowledge assimilation. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using Qwen2.5-7B as the base model, demonstrate that these human-inspired strategies synergistically and significantly enhance performance. Notably, their combined application improves performance over the standard Zero-RL baseline by 10% on the AIME24 benchmark and 16.6% on AIME25.

  Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents, driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), have emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling intelligent interaction with digital systems. This paper provides a structured survey of recent advances in GUI agents, focusing on architectures enhanced by Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first formalize GUI agent tasks as Markov Decision Processes and discuss typical execution environments and evaluation metrics. We then review the modular architecture of (M)LLM-based GUI agents, covering Perception, Planning, and Acting modules, and trace their evolution through representative works. Furthermore, we categorize GUI agent training methodologies into Prompt-based, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)-based, and RL-based approaches, highlighting the progression from simple prompt engineering to dynamic policy learning via RL. Our summary illustrates how recent innovations in multimodal perception, decision reasoning, and adaptive action generation have significantly improved the generalization and robustness of GUI agents in complex real-world environments. We conclude by identifying key challenges and future directions for building more capable and reliable GUI agents.
