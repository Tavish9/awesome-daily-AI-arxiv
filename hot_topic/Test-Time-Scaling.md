- **[FrankenBot: Brain-Morphic Modular Orchestration for Robotic Manipulation with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21627)**  `arXiv:2506.21627`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Developing a general robot manipulation system capable of performing a wide range of tasks in complex, dynamic, and unstructured real-world environments has long been a challenging task. It is widely recognized that achieving human-like efficiency and robustness manipulation requires the robotic brain to integrate a comprehensive set of functions, such as task planning, policy generation, anomaly monitoring and handling, and long-term memory, achieving high-efficiency operation across all functions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), pretrained on massive multimodal data, have acquired rich world knowledge, exhibiting exceptional scene understanding and multimodal reasoning capabilities. However, existing methods typically focus on realizing only a single function or a subset of functions within the robotic brain, without integrating them into a unified cognitive architecture. Inspired by a divide-and-conquer strategy and the architecture of the human brain, we propose FrankenBot, a VLM-driven, brain-morphic robotic manipulation framework that achieves both comprehensive functionality and high operational efficiency. Our framework includes a suite of components, decoupling a part of key functions from frequent VLM calls, striking an optimal balance between functional completeness and system efficiency. Specifically, we map task planning, policy generation, memory management, and low-level interfacing to the cortex, cerebellum, temporal lobe-hippocampus complex, and brainstem, respectively, and design efficient coordination mechanisms for the modules. We conducted comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world robotic environments, demonstrating that our method offers significant advantages in anomaly detection and handling, long-term memory, operational efficiency, and stability -- all without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern industry is increasingly moving away from mass manufacturing, towards more specialized and personalized products. As manufacturing tasks become more complex, full automation is not always an option, human involvement may be required. This has increased the need for advanced human robot collaboration (HRC), and with it, improved methods for interaction, such as voice control. Recent advances in natural language processing, driven by artificial intelligence (AI), have the potential to answer this demand. Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly developed very impressive general reasoning capabilities, and many methods of applying this to robotics have been proposed, including through the use of code generation. This paper presents Language Model Program Voice Control (LMPVC), an LLM-based prototype voice control architecture with integrated policy programming and teaching capabilities, built for use with Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) compatible robots. The architecture builds on prior works using code generation for voice control by implementing an additional programming and teaching system, the Policy Bank. We find this system can compensate for the limitations of the underlying LLM, and allow LMPVC to adapt to different downstream tasks without a slow and costly training process. The architecture and additional results are released on GitHub (this https URL).

  _Can Zheng, Jiguang He, Guofa Cai, Zitong Yu, Chung G. Kang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose BeamLLM, a vision-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) beam prediction framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to address the challenges of high training overhead and latency in mmWave communication systems. By combining computer vision (CV) with LLMs' cross-modal reasoning capabilities, the framework extracts user equipment (UE) positional features from RGB images and aligns visual-temporal features with LLMs' semantic space through reprogramming techniques. Evaluated on a realistic vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenario, the proposed method achieves 61.01% top-1 accuracy and 97.39% top-3 accuracy in standard prediction tasks, significantly outperforming traditional deep learning models. In few-shot prediction scenarios, the performance degradation is limited to 12.56% (top-1) and 5.55% (top-3) from time sample 1 to 10, demonstrating superior prediction capability.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful at integrating diverse data, but they often struggle with complex reasoning. While Reinforcement learning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky. Common issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation of overly detailed or "overthinking" reasoning. Our work investigates how the KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples, Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes samples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages more concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\% gain over the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning benchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade on general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating superior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal reasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available atthis https URL.

- **[Probabilistic Optimality for Inference-time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22376)**  `arXiv:2506.22376`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Youkang Wang, Jian Wang, Rubing Chen, Xiao-Yong Wei, Qing Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target performance level, providing the first principled guidance for compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop \textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal number of sampled responses. \textsc{OptScale} employs a language model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC) demonstrate that \textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance. Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's computational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and instability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filtering-Replay framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions. EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories, applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle, guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame enables a more fine-grained categorization of training samples, allowing for a deeper analysis of how different types of samples contribute to the learning process in RL. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[VersaPRM: Multi-Domain Process Reward Model via Synthetic Reasoning Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06737)**  `arXiv:2502.06737`  `cs.LG`  
  _Thomas Zeng, Shuibai Zhang, Shutong Wu, Christian Classen, Daewon Chae, Ethan Ewer, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Process Reward Models (PRMs) have proven effective at enhancing mathematical reasoning for Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging increased inference-time computation. However, they are predominantly trained on mathematical data and their generalizability to non-mathematical domains has not been rigorously studied. In response, this work first shows that current PRMs have poor performance in other domains. To address this limitation, we introduce VersaPRM, a multi-domain PRM trained on synthetic reasoning data generated using our novel data generation and annotation method. VersaPRM achieves consistent performance gains across diverse domains. For instance, in the MMLU-Pro category of Law, VersaPRM via weighted majority voting, achieves a 7.9% performance gain over the majority voting baseline -- surpassing Qwen2.5-Math-PRM's gain of 1.3%. We further contribute to the community by open-sourcing all data, code and models for VersaPRM.

- **[Fine-Grained Preference Optimization Improves Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21656)**  `arXiv:2506.21656`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Yifan Shen, Yuanzhe Liu, Jingyuan Zhu, Xu Cao, Xiaofeng Zhang, Yixiao He, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning, particularly when multi-step logic and precise spatial alignment are required. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0% gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general vision-language tasks.

  _Amirmohammad Izadi, Mohammad Ali Banayeeanzade, Fatemeh Askari, Ali Rahimiakbar, Mohammad Mahdi Vahedi, Hosein Hasani, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents. This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by 25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies, including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference, underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

- **[Can Video Large Multimodal Models Think Like Doubters-or Double-Down: A Study on Defeasible Video Entailment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22385)**  `arXiv:2506.22385`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Yue Zhang, Jilei Sun, Yunhui Guo, Vibhav Gogate_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence. In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals. Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work explores enabling Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to link visual cues across multiple images. A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based reinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods typically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be particularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and complex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation learning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as supervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two augmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image. During training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to compare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the model with rule-based reinforcement learning. Due to the high visual similarity and the presence of augmentations, the model must attend to subtle visual changes and perform logical reasoning to succeed. Experiments show that, although trained solely on visual comparison tasks, the learned reasoning ability generalizes effectively to a wide range of questions. Without relying on any human-annotated question-answer pairs, our method achieves significant improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and shows strong performance on general vision tasks.

  _Shaheer U. Saeed, Yipei Wang, Veeru Kasivisvanathan, Brian R. Davidson, Matthew J. Clarkson, Yipeng Hu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling adaptive decision-making in complex and unfamiliar scenarios. In contrast, machine intelligence remains bound to training data, lacking the ability to dynamically refine solutions at inference time. While some recent advances have explored reasoning in machines, these efforts are largely limited to verbal domains such as mathematical problem-solving, where explicit rules govern step-by-step reasoning. Other critical real-world tasks - including visual perception, spatial reasoning, and radiological diagnosis - require non-verbal reasoning, which remains an open challenge. Here we present a novel learning paradigm that enables machine reasoning in vision by allowing performance improvement with increasing thinking time (inference-time compute), even under conditions where labelled data is very limited. Inspired by dual-process theories of human cognition in psychology, our approach integrates a fast-thinking System I module for familiar tasks, with a slow-thinking System II module that iteratively refines solutions using self-play reinforcement learning. This paradigm mimics human reasoning by proposing, competing over, and refining solutions in data-scarce scenarios. We demonstrate superior performance through extended thinking time, compared not only to large-scale supervised learning but also foundation models and even human experts, in real-world vision tasks. These tasks include computer-vision benchmarks and cancer localisation on medical images across five organs, showcasing transformative potential for non-verbal machine reasoning.

- **[R1-Track: Direct Application of MLLMs to Visual Object Tracking via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21980)**  `arXiv:2506.21980`  `cs.CV`  
  _Biao Wang, Wenwen Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters, two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets, and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly. Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However, experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities. And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.

  _Zhao Jin, Rong-Cheng Tu, Jingyi Liao, Wenhao Sun, Xiao Luo, Shunyu Liu, et al._

  3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize target objects within a 3D scene based on natural language queries. To alleviate the reliance on costly 3D training data, recent studies have explored zero-shot 3DVG by leveraging the extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and VLMs. However, existing paradigms tend to emphasize either spatial (3D-based) or semantic (2D-based) understanding, limiting their effectiveness in complex real-world applications. In this work, we introduce SPAZER - a VLM-driven agent that combines both modalities in a progressive reasoning framework. It first holistically analyzes the scene and produces a 3D rendering from the optimal viewpoint. Based on this, anchor-guided candidate screening is conducted to perform a coarse-level localization of potential objects. Furthermore, leveraging retrieved relevant 2D camera images, 3D-2D joint decision-making is efficiently performed to determine the best-matching object. By bridging spatial and semantic reasoning neural streams, SPAZER achieves robust zero-shot grounding without training on 3D-labeled data. Extensive experiments on ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that SPAZER significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, achieving notable gains of 9.0% and 10.9% in accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong perception and reasoning capabilities for image-text input, Visual Question Answering (VQA) focusing on small image details still remains a challenge. Although visual cropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations: the need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed exhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations. We address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping method, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the search for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps: first, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute an object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and rank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the fine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed search strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA datasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping methods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing baseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.

  Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding, their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation. This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce ShotBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed (predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60% average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct ShotQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop ShotVL through supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on ShotBench, establishing new state-of-the-art performance. We open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.

  Remote sensing change detection is used in urban planning, terrain analysis, and environmental monitoring by analyzing feature changes in the same area over time. In this paper, we propose a large language model (LLM) augmented inference approach (SegChange-R1), which enhances the detection capability by integrating textual descriptive information and guides the model to focus on relevant change regions, accelerating convergence. We designed a linear attention-based spatial transformation module (BEV) to address modal misalignment by unifying features from different times into a BEV space. Furthermore, we introduce DVCD, a novel dataset for building change detection from UAV viewpoints. Experiments on four widely-used datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing method The code and pre-trained models are available in {this https URL}.

  _Nokimul Hasan Arif, Shadman Rabby, Md Hefzul Hossain Papon, Sabbir Ahmed_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), where the model generates responses that are inconsistent with the visual input, pose a significant challenge to their reliability, particularly in contexts where precise and trustworthy outputs are critical. Current research largely emphasizes post-hoc correction or model-specific fine-tuning strategies, with limited exploration of preprocessing techniques to address hallucination issues at the input stage. This study presents a novel ensemble-based preprocessing framework that adaptively selects the most appropriate filtering approach -- noise reduced (NR), edge enhanced (EE), or unaltered input (org) based on the type of question posed, resulting into reduced hallucination without requiring any modifications to the underlying model architecture or training pipeline. Evaluated on the `HaloQuest' dataset -- a benchmark designed to test multimodal reasoning on visually complex inputs, our method achieves a 44.3% reduction in hallucination rates, as measured by Natural Language Inference (NLI) scores using SelfCheckGPT. This demonstrates that intelligent input conditioning alone can significantly enhance factual grounding in LLM responses. The findings highlight the importance of adaptive preprocessing techniques in mitigating hallucinations, paving the way for more reliable multimodal systems capable of addressing real-world challenges.

  MLLM reasoning has drawn widespread research for its excellent problem-solving capability. Current reasoning methods fall into two types: PRM, which supervises the intermediate reasoning steps, and ORM, which supervises the final results. Recently, DeepSeek-R1 has challenged the traditional view that PRM outperforms ORM, which demonstrates strong generalization performance using an ORM method (i.e., GRPO). However, current MLLM's GRPO algorithms still struggle to handle challenging and complex multimodal reasoning tasks (e.g., mathematical reasoning). In this work, we reveal two problems that impede the performance of GRPO on the MLLM: Low data utilization and Text-bias. Low data utilization refers to that GRPO cannot acquire positive rewards to update the MLLM on difficult samples, and text-bias is a phenomenon that the MLLM bypasses image condition and solely relies on text condition for generation after GRPO training. To tackle these problems, this work proposes Hint-GRPO that improves data utilization by adaptively providing hints for samples of varying difficulty, and text-bias calibration that mitigates text-bias by calibrating the token prediction logits with image condition in test-time. Experiment results on three base MLLMs across eleven datasets demonstrate that our proposed methods advance the reasoning capability of original MLLM by a large margin, exhibiting superior performance to existing MLLM reasoning methods.

  With the advent of LLMs and variants, a flurry of research has emerged, analyzing the performance of such models across an array of tasks. While most studies focus on evaluating the capabilities of state-of-the-art (SoTA) Vision Language Models (VLMs) through task accuracy (e.g., visual question answering, grounding), our work explores the related but complementary aspect of consistency - the ability of a VLM to produce semantically similar or identical responses to semantically similar queries. We note that consistency is a fundamental prerequisite (necessary but not sufficient condition) for robustness and trust in VLMs. Armed with this perspective, we propose the MM-R3 benchmark, which allows us to analyze performance, in terms of consistency and accuracy, of SoTA VLMs on three tasks: Question Rephrasing, Image Restyling, and Context Reasoning. Our analysis reveals that consistency does not always align with accuracy, indicating that models with higher accuracy are not necessarily more consistent, and vice versa. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective mitigation strategy in the form of an adapter module trained to minimize inconsistency across prompts. With our proposed strategy, we are able to achieve absolute improvements of 5.7% and 12.5%, on average on widely used VLMs such as BLIP-2 and LLaVa 1.5M in terms of consistency over their existing counterparts.

  Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for future LLM development and evaluation.

  Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by allocating more compute budget during inference. To achieve this, existing methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%) over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world scenarios. The source code will be released soon.

  Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their ability to solve Olympiad-level math problems. However, the training and evaluation of these models are constrained by the limited size and quality of available datasets, as creating large-scale data for such advanced problems requires extensive effort from human experts. In addition, current benchmarks are prone to contamination, leading to unreliable evaluations. In this paper, we present an automated pipeline that leverages the rich resources of the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum, which predominantly features Olympiad-level problems and community-driven solutions. Using open-source LLMs, we develop a method to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in AoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their reasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic pipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with timestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a contamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance. Notably, we observe a significant decline in LLM performance over time, suggesting their success on older examples may stem from pre-training exposure rather than true reasoning ability. Our work presents a scalable approach to creating and maintaining large-scale, high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning, offering valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in this domain.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning. Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial, temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation, transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660 experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding -- e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones. More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and human-level world modeling.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose STRuCT-LLM, a unified framework for training large language models (LLMs) to perform structured reasoning over both relational and graph-structured data. Our approach jointly optimizes Text-to-SQL and Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) combined with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. To support fine-grained optimization in graph-based parsing, we introduce a topology-aware reward function based on graph edit distance. Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph formalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL and Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve Cypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest model (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on semantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5\% and Text2Cypher by 73.1\%. The model also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance on downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5\%) and knowledge graph QA (CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7\%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results demonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL and Cypher (code available atthis https URL).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite their widespread use in fact-checking, moderation, and high-stakes decision-making, large language models (LLMs) remain poorly understood as judges of truth. This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs' veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true, regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models (o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable evaluation and critique capabilities, providing insightful feedback and identifying flaws in various tasks. However, limited research has explored which types of critiques are most effective for improving model responses or how to generate such critiques. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{R}efinement-oriented \textbf{C}ritique \textbf{O}ptimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to train critic models using refinement signals. RCO uses a feedback loop where critiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its responses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these refinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By focusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need for direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving meaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e., dialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional methods and open-source models in terms of critique quality and refinement outcomes. Our contributions include the introduction of RCO, a novel supervision scheme based on refined response preferences, and comprehensive experimental results that highlight the method's effectiveness in enhancing LLM critique-refinement loops.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as backtracking, self-reflection and self-correction. Despite these developments, the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence on the final prediction - errors introduced at this stage can substantially degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed across two state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model families: DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3. To address this, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we introduce a new benchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning steps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a foundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.

  We present Gazal-R1, a 32-billion-parameter language model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical reasoning while providing transparent, step-by-step explanations for clinical decision-making. Built upon Qwen3 32B, our model demonstrates that strategic training can enable mid-sized models to outperform significantly larger counterparts in specialized domains. We developed a novel two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning on a carefully curated dataset of 107,033 synthetic medical reasoning examples that teaches structured clinical thinking, enhanced by advanced parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality. Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring 87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed reasoning. Our methodology offers a reproducible framework for developing high-capability, domain-specific language models that balance performance, efficiency, and explainability.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential but face challenges in complex financial reasoning tasks requiring both domain knowledge and sophisticated reasoning. Current evaluation benchmarks often fall short by not decoupling these capabilities indicators from single task performance and lack root cause analysis for task failure. To address this, we introduce FinEval-KR, a novel evaluation framework for decoupling and quantifying LLMs' knowledge and reasoning abilities independently, proposing distinct knowledge score and reasoning score metrics. Inspired by cognitive science, we further propose a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy to analyze capabilities in reasoning tasks across different cognitive levels. We also release a new open-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset covering 22 subfields to support reproducible research and further advancements in financial reasoning. Our experimental results reveal that LLM reasoning ability and higher-order cognitive ability are the core factors influencing reasoning accuracy. We also specifically find that even top models still face a bottleneck with knowledge application. Furthermore, our analysis shows that specialized financial LLMs generally lag behind the top general large models across multiple metrics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study evaluates the ability of DeepSeek, an open-source large language model (LLM), to simulate public opinions in comparison to LLMs developed by major tech companies. By comparing DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5, GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 and utilizing survey data from the American National Election Studies (ANES) and the Zuobiao dataset of China, we assess these models' capacity to predict public opinions on social issues in both China and the United States, highlighting their comparative capabilities between countries. Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating U.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate change, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily because it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or liberal personas. For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating opinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling views on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income and non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant differences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the free market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to overgeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting to consistent responses within groups. These findings highlight the need to mitigate cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling, calling for approaches such as more inclusive training methodologies.

  Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains a fundamental challenge due to a lack of structured, interpretable, and theoretically grounded benchmark designs. Existing benchmarks often adopt heuristic-based task groupings with unclear cognitive targets, thus resulting in overlapping abilities, redundant indicators, and limited diagnostic power. In this work, we propose a novel framework for aligning MLLM benchmark based on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze and quantify the internal validity, dimensional separability, and contribution of benchmark components. Motivated by the observed limitations of current designs, we further introduce a novel capability hierarchy grounded in Piagets theory of cognitive development, dividing MLLM abilities into three hierarchical layers, i.e., Perception, Memory, and Reasoning. We reorganize existing MLLM benchmarks under the proposed framework and construct a new benchmark named Gold. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark exhibits stronger interpretability, reduced indicator redundancy, and clearer cognitive consistency compared to existing approaches.

  The rapid spread of fake news across multimedia platforms presents serious challenges to information credibility. In this paper, we propose a Debunk-and-Infer framework for Fake News Detection(DIFND) that leverages debunking knowledge to enhance both the performance and interpretability of fake news detection. DIFND integrates the generative strength of conditional diffusion models with the collaborative reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, debunk diffusion is employed to generate refuting or authenticating evidence based on the multimodal content of news videos, enriching the evaluation process with diverse yet semantically aligned synthetic samples. To improve inference, we propose a chain-of-debunk strategy where a multi-agent MLLM system produces logic-grounded, multimodal-aware reasoning content and final veracity judgment. By jointly modeling multimodal features, generative debunking cues, and reasoning-rich verification within a unified architecture, DIFND achieves notable improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the FakeSV and FVC datasets show that DIFND not only outperforms existing approaches but also delivers trustworthy decisions.

  Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which represent explicit knowledge across multiple modalities, play a pivotal role by complementing the implicit knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enabling more grounded reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing MMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting pre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in outdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow range of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations reduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal tasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video and audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive multimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information, where each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed descriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures cross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained semantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling the automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset. We further introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed concept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities. Experiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical value in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed AM, enabling advanced in-context learning, prompt-based generation, and robust cross-domain adaptability. This survey systematically synthesizes recent advancements in LLM-driven AM.

  In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress but continue to face inherent challenges in multimodal reasoning, which requires multi-level (e.g., perception, reasoning) and multi-granular (e.g., multi-step reasoning chain) advanced inferencing. Prior work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of self-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task performance.

  Fully comprehending scientific papers by machines reflects a high level of Artificial General Intelligence, requiring the ability to reason across fragmented and heterogeneous sources of information, presenting a complex and practically significant challenge. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made remarkable strides in various tasks, particularly those involving reasoning with evidence source from single image or text page, their ability to use cross-source information for reasoning remains an open problem. This work presents MMCR, a high-difficulty benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' capacity for reasoning with cross-source information from scientific papers. The benchmark comprises 276 high-quality questions, meticulously annotated by humans across 7 subjects and 10 task types. Experiments with 18 VLMs demonstrate that cross-source reasoning presents a substantial challenge for existing models. Notably, even the top-performing model, GPT-4o, achieved only 48.55% overall accuracy, with only 20% accuracy in multi-table comprehension tasks, while the second-best model, Qwen2.5-VL-72B, reached 39.86% overall accuracy. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique on cross-source reasoning and observed a detrimental effect on small models, whereas larger models demonstrated substantially enhanced performance. These results highlight the pressing need to develop VLMs capable of effectively utilizing cross-source information for reasoning.

  Mental health is increasingly critical in contemporary healthcare, with psychotherapy demanding dynamic, context-sensitive interactions that traditional NLP methods struggle to capture. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential for addressing this gap due to their ability to handle extensive context and multi-turn reasoning. This review introduces a conceptual taxonomy dividing psychotherapy into interconnected stages--assessment, diagnosis, and treatment--to systematically examine LLM advancements and challenges. Our comprehensive analysis reveals imbalances in current research, such as a focus on common disorders, linguistic biases, fragmented methods, and limited theoretical integration. We identify critical challenges including capturing dynamic symptom fluctuations, overcoming linguistic and cultural biases, and ensuring diagnostic reliability. Highlighting future directions, we advocate for continuous multi-stage modeling, real-time adaptive systems grounded in psychological theory, and diversified research covering broader mental disorders and therapeutic approaches, aiming toward more holistic and clinically integrated psychotherapy LLMs systems.

  Ensuring the safety and harmlessness of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become equally critical as their performance in applications. However, existing safety alignment methods typically suffer from safety-performance trade-offs and the susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, primarily due to their reliance on direct refusals for malicious queries. In this paper, we propose STAIR, a novel framework that integrates SafeTy Alignment with Itrospective Reasoning. We enable LLMs to identify safety risks through step-by-step analysis by self-improving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning with safety awareness. STAIR first equips the model with a structured reasoning capability and then advances safety alignment via iterative preference optimization on step-level reasoning data generated using our newly proposed Safety-Informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (SI-MCTS). We further train a process reward model on this data to guide test-time searches for improved responses. Extensive experiments show that STAIR effectively mitigates harmful outputs while better preserving helpfulness, compared to instinctive alignment strategies. With test-time scaling, STAIR achieves a safety performance comparable to Claude-3.5 against popular jailbreak attacks. Relevant resources in this work are available atthis https URL.

  Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models (LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency. Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain, we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid, detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose reasoning systems.

To evaluate the ability of AI agents to reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time. Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an autonomous research agent.

  This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics, history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music, mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

  Self-evolution, the ability of agents to autonomously improve their reasoning and behavior, is essential for the embodied domain with long-horizon, real-world tasks. Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential to enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions remains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two fundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible intermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning signals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts generalization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we present Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework designed for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents. Specifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate signals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative policy optimization (Tree-GRPO), which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into GRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting autonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce Multi-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the effectiveness of SEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 36.19% (multi-modal), outperforming prior models including GPT-4o. SEEA-R1 also achieves scores of 80.3% without environmental reward, surpassing all open-source baselines and highlighting its scalability as a self-evolving embodied agent. Additional experiments and qualitative analysis further support the potential of SEEA-R1 for future research in scalable embodied intelligence.

  Vision-language model-based mobile agents have gained the ability to not only understand complex instructions and mobile screenshots, but also optimize their action outputs via thinking and reasoning, benefiting from reinforcement learning, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, existing research centers on offline reinforcement learning training or online optimization using action-level rewards, which limits the agent's dynamic interaction with the environment. This often results in agents settling into local optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action correction. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called Mobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with task-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three stages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level reward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn trajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error correction capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance improvements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese applications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new benchmark with 500 trajectories. We will open source all resources, including the dataset, benchmark, model weight, and codes:this https URL.

  This paper introduces KunLunBaizeRAG, a reinforcement learning-driven reasoning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in complex multi-hop question-answering tasks. The framework addresses key limitations of traditional RAG, such as retrieval drift, information redundancy, and strategy rigidity. Key innovations include the RAG-driven Reasoning Alignment (RDRA) mechanism, the Search-Think Iterative Enhancement (STIE) mechanism, the Network-Local Intelligent Routing (NLR) mechanism, and a progressive hybrid training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in exact match (EM) and LLM-judged score (LJ) across four benchmarks, highlighting the framework's robustness and effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios.

  Scientific progress increasingly relies on effective collaboration among researchers, a dynamic that large language models (LLMs) have only begun to emulate. While recent LLM-based scientist agents show promise in autonomous scientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation mechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal Discussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that incorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism enabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm that simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly promote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful scientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in computer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain. Results show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both datasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These findings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics in LLM-based autonomous research.

  Physics problem-solving is a challenging domain for large AI models, requiring integration of conceptual understanding, mathematical reasoning, and interpretation of physical diagrams. Current evaluation methodologies show notable limitations in capturing the breadth and complexity of undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for more rigorous assessments. To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level physics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8 major sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The benchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions, systematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative model-in-the-loop process. The benchmark's construction involved a rigorous multi-stage process, including multiple roll-outs, expert-level evaluation, automated filtering of easily solved problems, and a nuanced difficulty grading system with five levels. Through extensive experiments, we observe that current state-of-the-art models encounter substantial challenges in physics reasoning. For example, GPT-4o mini achieves only about 34.2% accuracy in the proposed PhysUniBench. These results highlight that current MLLMs struggle with advanced physics reasoning, especially on multi-step problems and those requiring precise diagram interpretation. By providing a broad and rigorous assessment tool, PhysUniBench aims to drive progress in AI for Science, encouraging the development of models with stronger physical reasoning, problem-solving skills, and multimodal understanding. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are available atthis https URL.

  AI-based peer review systems tend to produce shallow and overpraising suggestions compared to human feedback. Here, we evaluate how well a reasoning LLM trained with multi-objective reinforcement learning (REMOR) can overcome these limitations. We start by designing a multi-aspect reward function that aligns with human evaluation of reviews. The aspects are related to the review itself (e.g., criticisms, novelty) and the relationship between the review and the manuscript (i.e., relevance). First, we perform supervised fine-tuning of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B using LoRA on PeerRT, a new dataset of high-quality top AI conference reviews enriched with reasoning traces. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train two models: REMOR-H (with the human-aligned reward) and REMOR-U (with a uniform reward). Interestingly, the human-aligned reward penalizes aspects typically associated with strong reviews, leading REMOR-U to produce qualitatively more substantive feedback. Our results show that REMOR-U and REMOR-H achieve more than twice the average rewards of human reviews, non-reasoning state-of-the-art agentic multi-modal AI review systems, and general commercial LLM baselines. We found that while the best AI and human reviews are comparable in quality, REMOR avoids the long tail of low-quality human reviews. We discuss how reasoning is key to achieving these improvements and release the Human-aligned Peer Review Reward (HPRR) function, the Peer Review Reasoning-enriched Traces (PeerRT) dataset, and the REMOR models, which we believe can help spur progress in the area.

  Recent advances demonstrate that increasing inference-time computation can significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although repeated sampling (i.e., generating multiple candidate outputs) is a highly effective strategy, it does not leverage external feedback signals for refinement, which are often available in tasks like coding. In this work, we propose Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS), a novel inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree, AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to "go wider" by expanding new candidate responses or "go deeper" by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement for effective inference-time scaling.
