- **[Learning to Tune Like an Expert: Interpretable and Scene-Aware Navigation via MLLM Reasoning and CVAE-Based Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11001)**  `arXiv:2507.11001`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Service robots are increasingly deployed in diverse and dynamic environments, where both physical layouts and social contexts change over time and across locations. In these unstructured settings, conventional navigation systems that rely on fixed parameters often fail to generalize across scenarios, resulting in degraded performance and reduced social acceptance. Although recent approaches have leveraged reinforcement learning to enhance traditional planners, these methods often fail in real-world deployments due to poor generalization and limited simulation diversity, which hampers effective sim-to-real transfer. To tackle these issues, we present LE-Nav, an interpretable and scene-aware navigation framework that leverages multi-modal large language model reasoning and conditional variational autoencoders to adaptively tune planner hyperparameters. To achieve zero-shot scene understanding, we utilize one-shot exemplars and chain-of-thought prompting strategies. Additionally, a conditional variational autoencoder captures the mapping between natural language instructions and navigation hyperparameters, enabling expert-level tuning. Experiments show that LE-Nav can generate hyperparameters achieving human-level tuning across diverse planners and scenarios. Real-world navigation trials and a user study on a smart wheelchair platform demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on quantitative metrics such as success rate, efficiency, safety, and comfort, while receiving higher subjective scores for perceived safety and social acceptance.

- **[Step-wise Policy for Rare-tool Knowledge (SPaRK): Offline RL that Drives Diverse Tool Use in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11371)**  `arXiv:2507.11371`  `cs.LG` `cs.MA`  
  _Gabriel Bo, Koa Chang, Justin Gu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Step-wise Policy for Rare-tool Knowledge (SPaRK), a novel reinforcement learning framework that teaches large language models to explore diverse tool usage patterns beyond conventional high-temperature sampling. Building on recent advances in step-wise reinforcement learning, we introduce a dual-objective reward system that simultaneously optimizes for answer quality and tool diversity, training a Llama-3.1 8B model through offline PPO on synthetically generated trajectories from the MMLU-Pro dataset. Our approach uniquely employs a rarity-first exploitation strategy where a GPT-4o judge scores candidate actions across eight distinct tools plus chain-of-thought reasoning, with the policy favoring less-frequently used but still viable tools to encourage systematic exploration. Empirical results demonstrate that SPaRK achieves competitive performance across 14 MMLU-Pro categories while exhibiting significantly higher entropy in tool selection compared to both baseline and supervised fine-tuning approaches, suggesting that algorithmic exploration through explicit tool diversity can enhance reasoning capabilities without sacrificing accuracy.

- **[ReVISE: Learning to Refine at Test-Time via Intrinsic Self-Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14565)**  `arXiv:2502.14565`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Hyunseok Lee, Seunghyuk Oh, Jaehyung Kim, Jinwoo Shin, Jihoon Tack_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-awareness, i.e., the ability to assess and correct one's own generation, is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, making its replication in large language models (LLMs) an important yet challenging task. Previous works tackle this by employing extensive reinforcement learning or rather relying on large external verifiers. In this work, we propose Refine via Intrinsic Self-Verification (ReVISE), an efficient and effective framework that enables LLMs to self-correct their outputs through self-verification. The core idea of ReVISE is to enable LLMs to verify their reasoning processes and continually rethink reasoning trajectories based on its verification. We introduce a structured curriculum based upon online preference learning to implement this efficiently. Specifically, as ReVISE involves two challenging tasks (i.e., self-verification and reasoning correction), we tackle each task sequentially using curriculum learning, collecting both failed and successful reasoning paths to construct preference pairs for efficient training. During inference, our approach enjoys natural test-time scaling by integrating self-verification and correction capabilities, further enhanced by our proposed confidence-aware decoding mechanism. Our experiments on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that ReVISE achieves efficient self-correction and significantly improves reasoning performance.

  Training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning via maths and code datasets has become a major new focus in LLM post-training. Two particularly popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU, while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together, our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.

- **[GHPO: Adaptive Guidance for Stable and Efficient LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10628)**  `arXiv:2507.10628`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks. However, prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training instability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled learning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning framework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks, effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning baselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning models.

- **[Guiding LLM Decision-Making with Fairness Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11344)**  `arXiv:2507.11344`  `cs.LG`  
  _Zara Hall, Melanie Subbiah, Thomas P Zollo, Kathleen McKeown, Richard Zemel_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models are increasingly used to support high-stakes decisions, potentially influencing who is granted bail or receives a loan. Naive chain-of-thought sampling can improve average decision accuracy, but has also been shown to amplify unfair bias. To address this challenge and enable the trustworthy use of reasoning models in high-stakes decision-making, we propose a framework for training a generalizable Fairness Reward Model (FRM). Our model assigns a fairness score to LLM reasoning, enabling the system to down-weight biased trajectories and favor equitable ones when aggregating decisions across reasoning chains. We show that a single Fairness Reward Model, trained on weakly supervised, LLM-annotated examples of biased versus unbiased reasoning, transfers across tasks, domains, and model families without additional fine-tuning. Applied to real-world decision-making tasks including recidivism prediction and social media moderation, we show that our approach consistently improves fairness while matching, or even surpassing, baseline accuracy.

- **[Are DeepSeek R1 And Other Reasoning Models More Faithful?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08156)**  `arXiv:2501.08156`  `cs.LG`  
  _James Chua, Owain Evans_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models trained to solve reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning have achieved striking results. We refer to these models as reasoning models. Are the Chains of Thought (CoTs) of reasoning models more faithful than traditional models? We evaluate three reasoning models (based on Qwen-2.5, Gemini-2, and DeepSeek-V3-Base) on an existing test of faithful CoT. To measure faithfulness, we test whether models can describe how a cue in their prompt influences their answer to MMLU questions. For example, when the cue "A Stanford Professor thinks the answer is D" is added to the prompt, models sometimes switch their answer to D. In such cases, the DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model describes the cue's influence 59% of the time, compared to 7% for the non-reasoning DeepSeek model. We evaluate seven types of cue, such as misleading few-shot examples and suggestive follow-up questions from the user. Reasoning models describe cues that influence them much more reliably than all the non-reasoning models tested (including Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o). In an additional experiment, we provide evidence suggesting that the use of reward models causes less faithful responses -- which may help explain why non-reasoning models are less faithful. Our study has two main limitations. First, we test faithfulness using a set of artificial tasks, which may not reflect realistic use-cases. Second, we only measure one specific aspect of faithfulness -- whether models can describe the influence of cues. Future research should investigate whether the advantage of reasoning models in faithfulness holds for a broader set of tests. Still, we think this increase in faithfulness is promising for the explainability of language models.

- **[Warehouse Spatial Question Answering with LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10778)**  `arXiv:2507.10778`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Hsiang-Wei Huang, Jen-Hao Cheng, Kuang-Ming Chen, Cheng-Yen Yang, Bahaa Alattar, Yi-Ru Lin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatial understanding has been a challenging task for existing Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs). Previous methods leverage large-scale MLLM finetuning to enhance MLLM's spatial understanding ability. In this paper, we present a data-efficient approach. We propose a LLM agent system with strong and advanced spatial reasoning ability, which can be used to solve the challenging spatial question answering task in complex indoor warehouse scenarios. Our system integrates multiple tools that allow the LLM agent to conduct spatial reasoning and API tools interaction to answer the given complicated spatial question. Extensive evaluations on the 2025 AI City Challenge Physical AI Spatial Intelligence Warehouse dataset demonstrate that our system achieves high accuracy and efficiency in tasks such as object retrieval, counting, and distance estimation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale corpora excel at natural image tasks and are increasingly repurposed for healthcare; however, their competence in medical tasks remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive evaluation of open-source general-purpose and medically specialised VLMs, ranging from 3B to 72B parameters, across eight benchmarks: MedXpert, OmniMedVQA, PMC-VQA, PathVQA, MMMU, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD. To observe model performance across different aspects, we first separate it into understanding and reasoning components. Three salient findings emerge. First, large general-purpose models already match or surpass medical-specific counterparts on several benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot transfer from natural to medical images. Second, reasoning performance is consistently lower than understanding, highlighting a critical barrier to safe decision support. Third, performance varies widely across benchmarks, reflecting differences in task design, annotation quality, and knowledge demands. No model yet reaches the reliability threshold for clinical deployment, underscoring the need for stronger multimodal alignment and more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation protocols.

- **[KptLLM++: Towards Generic Keypoint Comprehension with Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11102)**  `arXiv:2507.11102`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jie Yang, Wang Zeng, Sheng Jin, Lumin Xu, Wentao Liu, Chen Qian, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized image understanding by bridging textual and visual modalities. However, these models often struggle with capturing fine-grained semantic information, such as the precise identification and analysis of object keypoints. Keypoints, as structure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects, particularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as fine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition. In this paper, we propose KptLLM++, a novel multimodal large language model that specifically designed for generic keypoint comprehension through the integration of diverse input modalities guided by user-defined instructions. By unifying keypoint detection across varied contexts, KptLLM++ establishes itself as an advanced interface, fostering more effective human-AI collaboration. The model is built upon a novel identify-then-detect paradigm, which first interprets keypoint semantics and subsequently localizes their precise positions through a structured chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism. To push the boundaries of performance, we have scaled up the training dataset to over 500K samples, encompassing diverse objects, keypoint categories, image styles, and scenarios with complex occlusions. This extensive scaling enables KptLLM++ to unlock its potential, achieving remarkable accuracy and generalization. Comprehensive experiments on multiple keypoint detection benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its potential as a unified solution for fine-grained image understanding and its transformative implications for human-AI interaction.

- **[Localizing Before Answering: A Hallucination Evaluation Benchmark for Grounded Medical Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00744)**  `arXiv:2505.00744`  `cs.CV`  
  _Dung Nguyen, Minh Khoi Ho, Huy Ta, Thanh Tam Nguyen, Qi Chen, Kumar Rav, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in medical data interpretation. However, these models frequently generate hallucinations contradicting source evidence, particularly due to inadequate localization reasoning. This work reveals a critical limitation in current medical LMMs: instead of analyzing relevant pathological regions, they often rely on linguistic patterns or attend to irrelevant image areas when responding to disease-related queries. To address this, we introduce HEAL-MedVQA (Hallucination Evaluation via Localization MedVQA), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs' localization abilities and hallucination robustness. HEAL-MedVQA features (i) two innovative evaluation protocols to assess visual and textual shortcut learning, and (ii) a dataset of 67K VQA pairs, with doctor-annotated anatomical segmentation masks for pathological regions. To improve visual reasoning, we propose the Localize-before-Answer (LobA) framework, which trains LMMs to localize target regions of interest and self-prompt to emphasize segmented pathological areas, generating grounded and reliable answers. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art biomedical LMMs on the challenging HEAL-MedVQA benchmark, advancing robustness in medical VQA.

- **[Unsupervised Visual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18397)**  `arXiv:2504.18397`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning greatly improves the interpretability and problem-solving abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches are focused on text CoT, limiting their ability to leverage visual cues. Visual CoT remains underexplored, and the only work is based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) that relies on extensive labeled bounding-box data and is hard to generalize to unseen cases. In this paper, we introduce Unsupervised Visual CoT (UV-CoT), a novel framework for image-level CoT reasoning via preference optimization. UV-CoT performs preference comparisons between model-generated bounding boxes (one is preferred and the other is dis-preferred), eliminating the need for bounding-box annotations. We get such preference data by introducing an automatic data generation pipeline. Given an image, our target MLLM (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B) generates seed bounding boxes using a template prompt and then answers the question using each bounded region as input. An evaluator MLLM (e.g., OmniLLM-12B) ranks the responses, and these rankings serve as supervision to train the target MLLM with UV-CoT by minimizing negative log-likelihood losses. By emulating human perception--identifying key regions and reasoning based on them--UV-CoT can improve visual comprehension, particularly in spatial reasoning tasks where textual descriptions alone fall short. Our experiments on six datasets demonstrate the superiority of UV-CoT, compared to the state-of-the-art textual and visual CoT methods. Our zero-shot testing on four unseen datasets shows the strong generalization of UV-CoT. The code is available inthis https URL.

- **[Unveiling the Invisible: Reasoning Complex Occlusions Amodally with AURA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10225)**  `arXiv:2503.10225`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhixuan Li, Hyunse Yoon, Sanghoon Lee, Weisi Lin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Amodal segmentation aims to infer the complete shape of occluded objects, even when the occluded region's appearance is unavailable. However, current amodal segmentation methods lack the capability to interact with users through text input and struggle to understand or reason about implicit and complex purposes. While methods like LISA integrate multi-modal large language models (LLMs) with segmentation for reasoning tasks, they are limited to predicting only visible object regions and face challenges in handling complex occlusion scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task named amodal reasoning segmentation, aiming to predict the complete amodal shape of occluded objects while providing answers with elaborations based on user text input. We develop a generalizable dataset generation pipeline and introduce a new dataset focusing on daily life scenarios, encompassing diverse real-world occlusions. Furthermore, we present AURA (Amodal Understanding and Reasoning Assistant), a novel model with advanced global and spatial-level designs specifically tailored to handle complex occlusions. Extensive experiments validate AURA's effectiveness on the proposed dataset.

- **[Emergence of Hierarchical Emotion Organization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10599)**  `arXiv:2507.10599`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Bo Zhao, Maya Okawa, Eric J. Bigelow, Rose Yu, Tomer Ullman, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) increasingly power conversational agents, understanding how they model users' emotional states is critical for ethical deployment. Inspired by emotion wheels -- a psychological framework that argues emotions organize hierarchically -- we analyze probabilistic dependencies between emotional states in model outputs. We find that LLMs naturally form hierarchical emotion trees that align with human psychological models, and larger models develop more complex hierarchies. We also uncover systematic biases in emotion recognition across socioeconomic personas, with compounding misclassifications for intersectional, underrepresented groups. Human studies reveal striking parallels, suggesting that LLMs internalize aspects of social perception. Beyond highlighting emergent emotional reasoning in LLMs, our results hint at the potential of using cognitively-grounded theories for developing better model evaluations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-thought traces have been shown to improve performance of large language models in a plethora of reasoning tasks, yet there is no consensus on the mechanism through which this performance boost is achieved. To shed more light on this, we introduce Causal CoT Graphs (CCGs), which are directed acyclic graphs automatically extracted from reasoning traces that model fine-grained causal dependencies in the language model output. A collection of $1671$ mathematical reasoning problems from MATH500, GSM8K and AIME, and their associated CCGs are compiled into our dataset -- \textbf{KisMATH}. Our detailed empirical analysis with 15 open-weight LLMs shows that (i) reasoning nodes in the CCG are mediators for the final answer, a condition necessary for reasoning; and (ii) LLMs emphasise reasoning paths given by the CCG, indicating that models internally realise structures akin to our graphs. KisMATH enables controlled, graph-aligned interventions and opens up avenues for further investigation into the role of chain-of-thought in LLM reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Timely identification and accurate risk stratification of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remain essential for reducing global mortality. While existing prediction models primarily leverage structured data, unstructured clinical notes contain valuable early indicators. This study introduces a novel LLM-augmented clinical NLP pipeline that employs domain-adapted large language models for symptom extraction, contextual reasoning, and correlation from free-text reports. Our approach integrates cardiovascular-specific fine-tuning, prompt-based inference, and entity-aware reasoning. Evaluations on MIMIC-III and CARDIO-NLP datasets demonstrate improved performance in precision, recall, F1-score, and AUROC, with high clinical relevance (kappa = 0.82) assessed by cardiologists. Challenges such as contextual hallucination, which occurs when plausible information contracts with provided source, and temporal ambiguity, which is related with models struggling with chronological ordering of events are addressed using prompt engineering and hybrid rule-based verification. This work underscores the potential of LLMs in clinical decision support systems (CDSS), advancing early warning systems and enhancing the translation of patient narratives into actionable risk assessments.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought them closer to matching human cognition across a variety of tasks. How well do these models align with human performance in detecting and mapping analogies? Prior research has shown that LLMs can extract similarities from analogy problems but lack robust human-like reasoning. Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the current study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a fine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human performance. First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in LLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity between the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity between the source and distractor texts. Second, it investigated the effectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies. Throughout, we examine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in humans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and not just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done). Our experiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters) and performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as GPT-4 and LLaMA3. This work advances our understanding of the analogical reasoning abilities of LLMs and their potential as models of human reasoning.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text classification, but their complexity hinders interpretability, making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods like LIME and SHAP offer local explanations by identifying influential words, but they rely on computationally expensive perturbations. These methods typically generate thousands of perturbed sentences and perform inferences on each, incurring a substantial computational burden, especially with LLMs. To address this, we propose \underline{P}erturbation-free \underline{L}ocal \underline{Ex}planation (PLEX), a novel method that leverages the contextual embeddings extracted from the LLM and a ``Siamese network" style neural network trained to align with feature importance scores. This one-off training eliminates the need for subsequent perturbations, enabling efficient explanations for any new sentence. We demonstrate PLEX's effectiveness on four different classification tasks (sentiment, fake news, fake COVID-19 news and depression), showing more than 92\% agreement with LIME and SHAP. Our evaluation using a ``stress test" reveals that PLEX accurately identifies influential words, leading to a similar decline in classification accuracy as observed with LIME and SHAP when these words are removed. Notably, in some cases, PLEX demonstrates superior performance in capturing the impact of key features. PLEX dramatically accelerates explanation, reducing time and computational overhead by two and four orders of magnitude, respectively. This work offers a promising solution for explainable LLM-based text classification.

- **[Critique-GRPO: Advancing LLM Reasoning with Natural Language and Numerical Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03106)**  `arXiv:2506.03106`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such as scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback: performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of self-reflection, and persistent failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and critique-guided self-refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration. Additionally, we employ a shaping function to amplify learning from correct, especially unfamiliar, refinements and penalize incorrect ones. Extensive experiments with Qwen2.5-7B-Base, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, and Qwen3-8B demonstrate that Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning and RL-based fine-tuning methods across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.4% and 3.8% on Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B, respectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO enables effective self-improvement through self-critiquing and weak-to-strong generalization, achieving consistent gains over GRPO, such as 16.7% and 10.0% pass@1 improvements on AIME 2024, respectively.

- **[FalseReject: A Resource for Improving Contextual Safety and Mitigating Over-Refusals in LLMs via Structured Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08054)**  `arXiv:2505.08054`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhehao Zhang, Weijie Xu, Fanyou Wu, Chandan K. Reddy_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safety alignment approaches in large language models (LLMs) often lead to the over-refusal of benign queries, significantly diminishing their utility in sensitive scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce FalseReject, a comprehensive resource containing 16k seemingly toxic queries accompanied by structured responses across 44 safety-related categories. We propose a graph-informed adversarial multi-agent interaction framework to generate diverse and complex prompts, while structuring responses with explicit reasoning to aid models in accurately distinguishing safe from unsafe contexts. FalseReject includes training datasets tailored for both standard instruction-tuned models and reasoning-oriented models, as well as a human-annotated benchmark test set. Our extensive benchmarking on 29 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals persistent over-refusal challenges. Empirical results demonstrate that supervised finetuning with FalseReject substantially reduces unnecessary refusals without compromising overall safety or general language capabilities.

- **[Fine-grained Stateful Knowledge Exploration: Effective and Efficient Graph Retrieval with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13444)**  `arXiv:2401.13444`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, yet updating their knowledge remains a significant challenge, often leading to outdated or inaccurate responses. A proposed solution is the integration of external knowledge bases, such as knowledge graphs, with LLMs. Most existing methods use a paradigm that treats the whole question as the objective, with relevant knowledge being incrementally retrieved from the knowledge graph. However, this paradigm often leads to a granularity mismatch between the target question and the retrieved entities and relations. As a result, the information in the question cannot precisely correspond to the retrieved knowledge. This may cause redundant exploration or omission of vital knowledge, thereby leading to enhanced computational consumption and reduced retrieval accuracy. To address the limitations of coarse-grained knowledge exploration, we propose FiSKE, a novel paradigm for Fine-grained Stateful Knowledge Exploration. FiSKE first decomposes questions into fine-grained clues, then employs an adaptive mapping strategy during knowledge exploration process to resolve ambiguity in clue-to-graph mappings. This strategy dynamically infers contextual correspondences while maintaining a stateful record of the mappings. A clue-driven termination mechanism ensures rigorous augmentation--leveraging fully mapped paths for LLMs while reverting to chain-of-thought reasoning when necessary. Our approach balances precision and efficiency. Experiments on multiple datasets revealed that our paradigm surpasses current advanced methods in knowledge retrieval while significantly reducing the average number of LLM invocations.

  Human reasoning involves different strategies, each suited to specific problems. Prior work shows that large language model (LLMs) tend to favor a single reasoning strategy, potentially limiting their effectiveness in diverse reasoning challenges. In this work, we investigate whether prompting can control LLMs reasoning strategies and assess its impact on logical problem-solving. While our experiments show that no single strategy consistently improves accuracy, performance could be enhanced if models could adaptively choose the optimal strategy. We propose methods to guide LLMs in strategy selection, highlighting new ways to refine their reasoning abilities.

  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns about benchmark data contamination (BDC), where models inadvertently memorize evaluation data, inflating performance metrics and undermining genuine generalization assessment. This paper introduces the Data Contamination Risk (DCR) framework, a lightweight, interpretable pipeline designed to detect and quantify BDC across four granular levels: semantic, informational, data, and label. By synthesizing contamination scores via a fuzzy inference system, DCR produces a unified DCR Factor that adjusts raw accuracy to reflect contamination-aware performance. Validated on 9 LLMs (0.5B-72B) across sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and arithmetic reasoning tasks, the DCR framework reliably diagnoses contamination severity and with accuracy adjusted using the DCR Factor to within 4% average error across the three benchmarks compared to the uncontaminated baseline. Emphasizing computational efficiency and transparency, DCR provides a practical tool for integrating contamination assessment into routine evaluations, fostering fairer comparisons and enhancing the credibility of LLM benchmarking practices.

  Efficient and accurate autoformalization methods, which leverage large-scale datasets of extensive natural language mathematical problems to construct formal language datasets, are key to advancing formal mathematical reasoning. In this paper, we propose an autoformalization pipeline based on large language models with error feedback, achieving a fully automatic and training-free formalization approach. Using this pipeline, we curate an Olympiad-level dataset aligning natural language problems with Lean formalizations. The dataset comprises $3,922$ mathematical problems in natural language and $9,787$ in Lean, of which $64.46\%$ were assessed as at least above-average quality, making it suitable as a benchmark for automated theorem provers. Additionally, we investigate the formalization and reasoning capabilities of various LLMs and empirically demonstrate that few-shot learning, error feedback, and increasing sampling numbers enhance the autoformalization process. Experiments of three automated theorem provers on the \dataset\ dataset also highlight its challenging nature and its value as a benchmark for formal reasoning tasks.

  We present a robust ensemble-based system for multilingual multimodal reasoning, designed for the ImageCLEF 2025 EXAMS V challenge. Our approach integrates Gemini 2.5 Flash for visual description, Gemini 1.5 Pro for caption refinement and consistency checks, and Gemini 2.5 Pro as a reasoner which handles final answer selection, all coordinated through carefully engineered few-shot and zero-shot prompts. We conducted an extensive ablation study, training several large language models (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Phi 4, Gemma 3, Mistral) on an English dataset and its multilingual augmented version. Additionally, we evaluated Gemini 2.5 Flash in a zero-shot setting for comparison and found it to substantially outperform the trained models. Prompt design also proved critical: enforcing concise, language-normalized formats and prohibiting explanatory text boosted model accuracy on the English validation set from 55.9% to 61.7%. On the official leaderboard, our system (Team MSA) achieved first place overall in the multilingual track with 81.4% accuracy, and led 11 out of 13 individual language tracks, with top results such as 95.07% for Croatian and 92.12% for Italian. These findings highlight that lightweight OCR-VLM ensembles, when paired with precise prompt strategies and cross-lingual augmentation, can outperform heavier end-to-end models in high-stakes, multilingual educational settings.

  Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on task-specific benchmarks, yet their evaluation methods remain constrained by isolated problem-solving paradigms. Existing benchmarks predominantly assess single-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical limitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly creation of new questions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate models under multi-context pressure, a key requirement for real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through Simultaneous Testing), a stress-testing framework that exposes LRMs to multiple problems simultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST evaluates several under-tested capabilities: contextual priority allocation, cross-problem interference resistance, and dynamic cognitive load management. Our evaluation reveals several striking findings: Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit substantial performance degradation under stress testing. Crucially, REST demonstrates stronger discriminative power than existing benchmarks, revealing pronounced performance differences among models that exhibit similar, near-ceiling performance under single-question evaluations. Some key insights emerge from our analysis: (1) the "overthinking trap" is a critical factor contributing to the performance degradation; (2) the models trained with "long2short" technique preserve more accuracy of their single-problem performance under REST, outperforming standard-trained counterparts. These results establish REST as a cost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm that better reflects real-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on continuous human annotation.

  We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks, where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity. Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost. Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting. Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models, including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately 30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine visual perception with the general capabilities, such as reasoning, of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the mechanisms by which these two abilities can be combined and contribute remain poorly understood. In this work, we explore to compose perception and reasoning through model merging that connects parameters of different models. Unlike previous works that often focus on merging models of the same kind, we propose merging models across modalities, enabling the incorporation of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that model merging offers a successful pathway to transfer reasoning abilities from LLMs to VLMs in a training-free manner. Moreover, we utilize the merged models to understand the internal mechanism of perception and reasoning and how merging affects it. We find that perception capabilities are predominantly encoded in the early layers of the model, whereas reasoning is largely facilitated by the middle-to-late layers. After merging, we observe that all layers begin to contribute to reasoning, whereas the distribution of perception abilities across layers remains largely unchanged. These observations shed light on the potential of model merging as a tool for multimodal integration and interpretation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-thought explanations are widely used to inspect the decision process of large language models (LLMs) and to evaluate the trustworthiness of model outputs, making them important for effective collaboration between LLMs and humans. We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the alignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these explanations. This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides alignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response and the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering to safety standards), creating potential conflicts. The RM lacks a mechanism to assess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the generated explanation. Consequently, the LLM may engage in "reward hacking" by producing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation tailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning. To address this issue, we propose enriching the RM's input with a causal attribution of the prediction, allowing the RM to detect discrepancies between the generated self-explanation and the model's decision process. In controlled settings, we show that this approach reduces the tendency of the LLM to generate misleading explanations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Intrinsic self-correction was proposed to improve LLMs' responses via feedback prompts solely based on their inherent capability. However, recent works show that LLMs' intrinsic self-correction fails without oracle labels as feedback prompts. In this paper, we aim to interpret LLMs' intrinsic self-correction for different tasks, especially for those failure cases. By including one simple task and three complex tasks with state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs like ChatGPT families (o1, 4o, 3.5-turbo) and Llama families (2-7B, 3-8B, and 3.1-8B), we design three interpretation methods to reveal the dark side of LLMs' intrinsic self-correction. We identify intrinsic self-correction can (1) cause LLMs to waver both intermedia and final answers and lead to prompt bias on simple factual questions; (2) introduce human-like cognitive bias on complex tasks. In light of our findings, we also provide two simple yet effective strategies for alleviation: question repeating and supervised fine-tuning with a few samples.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mobile robots are increasingly required to navigate and interact within unknown and unstructured environments to meet human demands. Demand-driven navigation (DDN) enables robots to identify and locate objects based on implicit human intent, even when object locations are unknown. However, traditional data-driven DDN methods rely on pre-collected data for model training and decision-making, limiting their generalization capability in unseen scenarios. In this paper, we propose CogDDN, a VLM-based framework that emulates the human cognitive and learning mechanisms by integrating fast and slow thinking systems and selectively identifying key objects essential to fulfilling user demands. CogDDN identifies appropriate target objects by semantically aligning detected objects with the given instructions. Furthermore, it incorporates a dual-process decision-making module, comprising a Heuristic Process for rapid, efficient decisions and an Analytic Process that analyzes past errors, accumulates them in a knowledge base, and continuously improves performance. Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning strengthens the decision-making process. Extensive closed-loop evaluations on the AI2Thor simulator with the ProcThor dataset show that CogDDN outperforms single-view camera-only methods by 15%, demonstrating significant improvements in navigation accuracy and adaptability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed within agentic systems-collections of interacting, LLM-powered agents that execute complex, adaptive workflows using memory, tools, and dynamic planning. While enabling powerful new capabilities, these systems also introduce unique forms of uncertainty stemming from probabilistic reasoning, evolving memory states, and fluid execution paths. Traditional software observability and operations practices fall short in addressing these challenges.This paper introduces AgentOps: a comprehensive framework for observing, analyzing, optimizing, and automating operation of agentic AI systems. We identify distinct needs across four key roles-developers, testers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and business users-each of whom engages with the system at different points in its lifecycle. We present the AgentOps Automation Pipeline, a six-stage process encompassing behavior observation, metric collection, issue detection, root cause analysis, optimized recommendations, and runtime automation. Throughout, we emphasize the critical role of automation in managing uncertainty and enabling self-improving AI systems-not by eliminating uncertainty, but by taming it to ensure safe, adaptive, and effective operation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) display striking surface fluency yet systematically fail at tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy, and logical consistency. This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and \textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.

  We investigate the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and their scalability in complex non-monotonic reasoning. To this end, we introduce ZebraLogic, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing LLM reasoning performance on logic grid puzzles derived from constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). ZebraLogic enables the generation of puzzles with controllable and quantifiable complexity, facilitating a systematic study of the scaling limits of models such as Llama, o1 models, and DeepSeek-R1. By encompassing a broad range of search space complexities and diverse logical constraints, ZebraLogic provides a structured environment to evaluate reasoning under increasing difficulty.Our results reveal a significant decline in accuracy as problem complexity grows -- a phenomenon we term the curse of complexity. This limitation persists even with larger models and increased inference-time computation, suggesting inherent constraints in current LLM reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we explore strategies to enhance logical reasoning, including Best-of-N sampling, backtracking mechanisms, and self-verification prompts. Our findings offer critical insights into the scalability of LLM reasoning, highlight fundamental limitations, and outline potential directions for improvement.

  We introduce Agentic Reasoning, a framework that enhances large language model (LLM) reasoning by integrating external tool-using agents. Agentic Reasoning dynamically leverages web search, code execution, and structured memory to address complex problems requiring deep research. A key innovation in our framework is the Mind-Map agent, which constructs a structured knowledge graph to store reasoning context and track logical relationships, ensuring coherence in long reasoning chains with extensive tool usage. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive exploration of the Web-Search agent, leading to a highly effective search mechanism that surpasses all prior approaches. When deployed on DeepSeek-R1, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among public models and delivers performance comparable to OpenAI Deep Research, the leading proprietary model in this domain. Extensive ablation studies validate the optimal selection of agentic tools and confirm the effectiveness of our Mind-Map and Web-Search agents in enhancing LLM reasoning.

  Large vision language models (LVLMs) have improved the document understanding capabilities remarkably, enabling the handling of complex document elements, longer contexts, and a wider range of tasks. However, existing document understanding benchmarks have been limited to handling only a small number of pages and fail to provide a comprehensive analysis of layout elements locating. In this paper, we first define three primary task categories: Long Document Understanding, numerical Reasoning, and cross-element Locating, and then propose a comprehensive benchmark, LongDocURL, integrating above three primary tasks and comprising 20 sub-tasks categorized based on different primary tasks and answer evidences. Furthermore, we develop a semi-automated construction pipeline and collect 2,325 high-quality question-answering pairs, covering more than 33,000 pages of documents, significantly outperforming existing benchmarks. Subsequently, we conduct comprehensive evaluation experiments on both open-source and closed-source models across 26 different configurations, revealing critical performance gaps in this field.

  Production-grade LLM systems require robust adherence to dozens or even hundreds of instructions simultaneously. However, the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs at high instruction densities have not yet been characterized, as existing benchmarks only evaluate models on tasks with a single or few instructions. We introduce IFScale, a simple benchmark of 500 keyword-inclusion instructions for a business report writing task to measure how instruction-following performance degrades as instruction density increases. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art models across seven major providers and find that even the best frontier models only achieve 68% accuracy at the max density of 500 instructions. Our analysis reveals model size and reasoning capability to correlate with 3 distinct performance degradation patterns, bias towards earlier instructions, and distinct categories of instruction-following errors. Our insights can help inform design of instruction-dense prompts in real-world applications and highlight important performance-latency tradeoffs. We open-source the benchmark and all results for further analysis atthis https URL.

  API calls by large language models (LLMs) offer a cutting-edge approach for data analysis. However, their ability to effectively utilize tools via API calls remains underexplored in knowledge-intensive domains like meteorology. This paper introduces KG2data, a system that integrates knowledge graphs, LLMs, ReAct agents, and tool-use technologies to enable intelligent data acquisition and query handling in the meteorological field. Using a virtual API, we evaluate API call accuracy across three metrics: name recognition failure, hallucination failure, and call correctness. KG2data achieves superior performance (1.43%, 0%, 88.57%) compared to RAG2data (16%, 10%, 72.14%) and chat2data (7.14%, 8.57%, 71.43%). KG2data differs from typical LLM-based systems by addressing their limited access to domain-specific knowledge, which hampers performance on complex or terminology-rich queries. By using a knowledge graph as persistent memory, our system enhances content retrieval, complex query handling, domain-specific reasoning, semantic relationship resolution, and heterogeneous data integration. It also mitigates the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs, making the system more adaptable to evolving domain knowledge and API structures. In summary, KG2data provides a novel solution for intelligent, knowledge-based question answering and data analysis in domains with high knowledge demands.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their reasoning capabilities through feedback. A critical challenge is verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference answers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced. Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based verifiers. However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM judges can be inconsistent. Existing research primarily focuses on building better verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers' performance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). To address this, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating verifiers. We construct 4,000 expert-level questions covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Each question is equipped with reference answers and diverse responses. The reliability of the evaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a multidisciplinary expert team. We design a four-dimensional experimental framework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized verifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs. complete responses, and short vs. long outputs. Our evaluation uncovers fundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve leading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show stronger inclusivity but unstable precision. More importantly, we discover verifiers' high sensitivity to input structure and inherent limitations in cross-domain generalization, providing critical insights into the bottlenecks of current verifier technology.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning-capable language models achieve state-of-the-art performance in diverse complex tasks by generating long, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. While recent works show that base models can acquire such reasoning traces via reinforcement learning or distillation from stronger models like DeepSeek-R1, previous works demonstrate that even short CoT prompting without fine-tuning is able to improve reasoning. We ask whether long CoT can be induced in a base model using only prompting or minimal tuning. Using just 20 long CoT examples from the reasoning model \texttt{QwQ-32B-Preview}, we lightly fine-tune the base model \texttt{Qwen2.5-32B}. The resulting model outperforms the much larger \texttt{Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct}, showing that a handful of high-quality examples can unlock strong reasoning capabilities. We further explore using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators, enhanced with prompt engineering, multi-pass editing, and structural guidance. However, neither matches the performance of reasoning model traces, suggesting that certain latent qualities of expert CoT are difficult to replicate. We analyze key properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty, diversity, and answer length, that influence reasoning distillation. While challenges remain, we are optimistic that carefully curated human-written CoT, even in small quantities, can activate reasoning behaviors in base models. We release our human-authored dataset across refinement stages and invite further investigation into what makes small-scale reasoning supervision so effective.
