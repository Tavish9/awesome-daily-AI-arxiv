- **[Evo-0: Vision-Language-Action Model with Implicit Spatial Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00416)**  `arXiv:2507.00416`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising framework for enabling generalist robots capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in the real world. These models usually build upon pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which excel at semantic understanding due to large-scale text pretraining. However, VLMs typically lack precise spatial understanding capabilities, as they are primarily tuned on 2D image-text pairs without 3D supervision. To address this limitation, recent approaches have incorporated explicit 3D inputs such as point clouds or depth maps, but this necessitates additional depth sensors or defective estimation. In contrast, our work introduces a plug-and-play module that implicitly injects 3D geometry features into VLA models by leveraging an off-the-shelf visual geometry foundation models. We design five spatially challenging tasks that require precise spatial understanding ability to validate effectiveness of our method. Extensive evaluations show that our method significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art VLA models across diverse scenarios.

- **[HumanoidGen: Data Generation for Bimanual Dexterous Manipulation via LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00833)**  `arXiv:2507.00833`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  For robotic manipulation, existing robotics datasets and simulation benchmarks predominantly cater to robot-arm platforms. However, for humanoid robots equipped with dual arms and dexterous hands, simulation tasks and high-quality demonstrations are notably lacking. Bimanual dexterous manipulation is inherently more complex, as it requires coordinated arm movements and hand operations, making autonomous data collection challenging. This paper presents HumanoidGen, an automated task creation and demonstration collection framework that leverages atomic dexterous operations and LLM reasoning to generate relational constraints. Specifically, we provide spatial annotations for both assets and dexterous hands based on the atomic operations, and perform an LLM planner to generate a chain of actionable spatial constraints for arm movements based on object affordances and scenes. To further improve planning ability, we employ a variant of Monte Carlo tree search to enhance LLM reasoning for long-horizon tasks and insufficient annotation. In experiments, we create a novel benchmark with augmented scenarios to evaluate the quality of the collected data. The results show that the performance of the 2D and 3D diffusion policies can scale with the generated dataset. Project page isthis https URL.

  The long-standing vision of intelligent cities is to create efficient, livable, and sustainable urban environments using big data and artificial intelligence technologies. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new ways toward realizing this vision. With powerful semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, LLMs can be deployed as intelligent agents capable of autonomously solving complex problems across domains. In this article, we focus on Urban LLM Agents, which are LLM-powered agents that are semi-embodied within the hybrid cyber-physical-social space of cities and used for system-level urban decision-making. First, we introduce the concept of urban LLM agents, discussing their unique capabilities and features. Second, we survey the current research landscape from the perspective of agent workflows, encompassing urban sensing, memory management, reasoning, execution, and learning. Third, we categorize the application domains of urban LLM agents into five groups: urban planning, transportation, environment, public safety, and urban society, presenting representative works in each group. Finally, we discuss trustworthiness and evaluation issues that are critical for real-world deployment, and identify several open problems for future research. This survey aims to establish a foundation for the emerging field of urban LLM agents and to provide a roadmap for advancing the intersection of LLMs and urban intelligence. A curated list of relevant papers and open-source resources is maintained and continuously updated atthis https URL.

- **[Reasoning as an Adaptive Defense for Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00971)**  `arXiv:2507.00971`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Taeyoun Kim, Fahim Tajwar, Aditi Raghunathan, Aviral Kumar_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning methods that adaptively allocate test-time compute have advanced LLM performance on easy to verify domains such as math and code. In this work, we study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of robustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide benefits. We build a recipe called $\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners for Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to reason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that balances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical design choices: (1) a "lightweight" warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful, harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning capabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better distinguish between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to both white-box (e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our work provides an effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks and harmful requests by reasoning per prompt.

- **[Cognitive Load-Aware Inference: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Optimizing the Token Economy of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00653)**  `arXiv:2507.00653`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The escalating computational costs of Large Language Model (LLM) inference have become a critical barrier to their widespread and sustainable deployment. While existing optimization strategies are effective, they are predominantly based on statistical heuristics or architectural modifications, lacking a guiding cognitive theory to manage the inference process itself. This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel paradigm: the Cognitive Load-Aware Inference (CLAI) framework, which operationalizes principles from Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and neuroscience for LLM inference. We formalize the concepts of Intrinsic Cognitive Load, Extraneous Cognitive Load, and Germane Cognitive Load into quantifiable LLM metrics ($ICL_{LLM}$, $ECL_{LLM}$, and $GCL_{LLM}$), thereby reframing the inference process as a cognitive economics optimization problem: based on the intrinsic complexity of a problem ($ICL_{LLM}$), minimize wasteful computation ($ECL_{LLM}$), and strategically allocate the token budget to productive reasoning ($GCL_{LLM}$). We propose two implementation paths: CLAI-Prompt, a zero-shot method that guides a base LLM through cognitive control steps via a structured meta-prompt, and CLAI-Tune, a fine-tuned model that internalizes these principles for spontaneous cognitive economy. Across a range of benchmarks in complex reasoning, long-context question answering, and code generation, our methods achieve significant reductions in token consumption (up to 45\%) without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, CLAI-Tune exhibits an emergent ability to autonomously decompose difficult problems, a key characteristic of human expert cognition. This work demonstrates that by emulating the brain's resource management strategies, we can build more efficient, robust, and capable artificial intelligence systems.

- **[Large Reasoning Models are not thinking straight: on the unreliability of thinking trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00711)**  `arXiv:2507.00711`  `cs.LG`  
  _Jhouben Cuesta-Ramirez, Samuel Beaussant, Mehdi Mounsif_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) have recently achieved impressive results on reasoning benchmarks. Yet, growing evidence shows that these models often generate longer but ineffective chains of thought (CoTs), calling into question whether benchmark gains reflect real reasoning improvements. We present new evidence of overthinking, where models disregard correct solutions even when explicitly provided, instead continuing to generate unnecessary reasoning steps that often lead to incorrect conclusions. Experiments on three state-of-the-art models using the AIME2024 math benchmark reveal critical limitations in these models ability to integrate corrective information, posing new challenges for achieving robust and interpretable reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many applications, including challenging reasoning problems via chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) techniques that generate ``thinking tokens'' before answering the questions. While existing theoretical works demonstrate that CoTs with discrete tokens boost the capability of LLMs, recent work on continuous CoTs lacks a theoretical understanding of why it outperforms discrete counterparts in various reasoning tasks such as directed graph reachability, a fundamental graph reasoning problem that includes many practical domain applications as special cases. In this paper, we prove that a two-layer transformer with $D$ steps of continuous CoTs can solve the directed graph reachability problem, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph, while the best known result of constant-depth transformers with discrete CoTs requires $O(n^2)$ decoding steps where $n$ is the number of vertices ($D<n$). In our construction, each continuous thought vector is a superposition state that encodes multiple search frontiers simultaneously (i.e., parallel breadth-first search (BFS)), while discrete CoTs must choose a single path sampled from the superposition state, which leads to sequential search that requires many more steps and may be trapped into local solutions. We also performed extensive experiments to verify that our theoretical construction aligns well with the empirical solution obtained via training dynamics. Notably, encoding of multiple search frontiers as a superposition state automatically emerges in training continuous CoTs, without explicit supervision to guide the model to explore multiple paths simultaneously.

  _Anna-Maria Halacheva, Jan-Nico Zaech, Xi Wang, Danda Pani Paudel, Luc Van Gool_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As multimodal language models advance, their application to 3D scene understanding is a fast-growing frontier, driving the development of 3D Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Current methods show strong dependence on object detectors, introducing processing bottlenecks and limitations in taxonomic flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a scene-centric 3D VLM for 3D Gaussian splat scenes that employs language- and task-aware scene representations. Our approach directly embeds rich linguistic features into the 3D scene representation by associating language with each Gaussian primitive, achieving early modality alignment. To process the resulting dense representations, we introduce a dual sparsifier that distills them into compact, task-relevant tokens via task-guided and location-guided pathways, producing sparse, task-aware global and local scene tokens. Notably, we present the first Gaussian splatting-based VLM, leveraging photorealistic 3D representations derived from standard RGB images, demonstrating strong generalization: it improves performance of prior 3D VLM five folds, in out-of-the-domain settings.

  _Zifu Wan, Ce Zhang, Silong Yong, Martin Q. Ma, Simon Stepputtis, Louis-Philippe Morency, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have introduced a new paradigm for understanding and reasoning about image input through textual responses. Although they have achieved remarkable performance across a range of multi-modal tasks, they face the persistent challenge of hallucination, which introduces practical weaknesses and raises concerns about their reliable deployment in real-world applications. Existing work has explored contrastive decoding approaches to mitigate this issue, where the output of the original LVLM is compared and contrasted with that of a perturbed version. However, these methods require two or more queries that slow down LVLM response generation, making them less suitable for real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose ONLY, a training-free decoding approach that requires only a single query and a one-layer intervention during decoding, enabling efficient real-time deployment. Specifically, we enhance textual outputs by selectively amplifying crucial textual information using a text-to-visual entropy ratio for each token. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed ONLY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks while requiring minimal implementation effort and computational cost.

  We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking, a vision-language model (VLM) designed to advance general-purpose multimodal reasoning. In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) then unlocks the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document understanding, among others. To facilitate research in this field, we open-source GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, which achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size. In a comprehensive evaluation across 28 public benchmarks, our model outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on nearly all tasks and achieves comparable or even superior performance on 18 benchmarks relative to the significantly larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Notably, GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking also demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to closed-source models such as GPT-4o on challenging tasks including long document understanding and STEM reasoning, further underscoring its strong capabilities.

  Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance. However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.

  Recent agentic Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT-o3 have achieved near-ceiling scores on various existing benchmarks, motivating a demand for more challenging test tasks. These MLLMs have been reported to excel in a few expert-level tasks for humans, e.g., GeoGuesser, reflecting their potential as a detective who can notice minuscule cues in an image and weave them into coherent, situational explanations, leading to a reliable answer. But can they match the performance of excellent human detectives? To answer this question, we investigate some hard scenarios where GPT-o3 can still handle, and find a common scenario where o3's performance drops to nearly zero, which we name CaughtCheating. It is inspired by the social media requests that ask others to detect suspicious clues from photos shared by the poster's partner. We conduct extensive experiments and analysis to understand why existing MLLMs lack sufficient capability to solve this kind of task. CaughtCheating provides a class of challenging visual perception and reasoning tasks with great value and practical usage. Success in these tasks paves the way for MLLMs to acquire human-level detective perception and reasoning capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in video large language models (Video LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of video question answering (VideoQA). While existing methods perform well on short videos, they often struggle with long-range reasoning in longer videos. To scale Video LLMs for longer video content, frame sub-sampling (selecting frames at regular intervals) is commonly used. However, this approach is suboptimal, often leading to the loss of crucial frames or the inclusion of redundant information from multiple similar frames. Missing key frames impairs the model's ability to answer questions accurately, while redundant frames lead the model to focus on irrelevant video segments and increase computational resource consumption. In this paper, we investigate the use of a general-purpose text-to-video moment retrieval model to guide the frame sampling process. We propose "moment sampling", a novel, model-agnostic approach that enables the model to select the most relevant frames according to the context of the question. Specifically, we employ a lightweight moment retrieval model to prioritize frame selection. By focusing on the frames most pertinent to the given question, our method enhances long-form VideoQA performance in Video LLMs. Through extensive experiments on four long-form VideoQA datasets, using four state-of-the-art Video LLMs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

  _Jiaming Zhang, Rui Hu, Qing Guo, Wei Yang Bryan Lim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video Multimodal Large Language Models (V-MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in temporal reasoning and cross-modal understanding, yet their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains underexplored due to unique challenges: complex cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, temporal dependencies, and computational constraints. We present CAVALRY-V (Cross-modal Language-Vision Adversarial Yielding for Videos), a novel framework that directly targets the critical interface between visual perception and language generation in V-MLLMs. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a dual-objective semantic-visual loss function that simultaneously disrupts the model's text generation logits and visual representations to undermine cross-modal integration, and (2) a computationally efficient two-stage generator framework that combines large-scale pre-training for cross-model transferability with specialized fine-tuning for spatiotemporal coherence. Empirical evaluation on comprehensive video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that CAVALRY-V significantly outperforms existing attack methods, achieving 22.8% average improvement over the best baseline attacks on both commercial systems (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0) and open-source models (QwenVL-2.5, InternVL-2.5, Llava-Video, Aria, MiniCPM-o-2.6). Our framework achieves flexibility through implicit temporal coherence modeling rather than explicit regularization, enabling significant performance improvements even on image understanding (34.4% average gain). This capability demonstrates CAVALRY-V's potential as a foundational approach for adversarial research across multimodal systems.

  _Djamahl Etchegaray, Yuxia Fu, Zi Huang, Yadan Luo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Interpretable communication is essential for safe and trustworthy autonomous driving, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often operate under idealized assumptions and struggle to capture user intent in real-world scenarios. Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene descriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs can respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a box-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs on spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express intent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for focused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical evaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess basic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for box-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3) spatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To support this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual attributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object trajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs. Rigorous quality control through negative sampling, temporal consistency checks, and difficulty-aware balancing guarantee dataset robustness and diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals significant limitations in current VLMs when queried about perception questions, highlighting the gap in achieving real-world performance. This work provides a foundation for developing more robust and interpretable autonomous driving systems that can communicate effectively with users under real-world conditions.

- **[Listener-Rewarded Thinking in VLMs for Image Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22832)**  `arXiv:2506.22832`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Alexander Gambashidze, Li Pengyi, Matvey Skripkin, Andrey Galichin, Anton Gusarov, Konstantin Sobolev, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model ("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score, shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6% over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here:this https URL.

  _Duo Zheng, Shijia Huang, Yanyang Li, Liwei Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Previous research has investigated the application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding 3D scenes by interpreting them as videos. These approaches generally depend on comprehensive 3D data inputs, such as point clouds or reconstructed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps. In our research, we advance this field by enhancing the capability of MLLMs to understand and reason in 3D spaces directly from video data, without the need for additional 3D input. We propose a novel and efficient method, the Video-3D Geometry Large Language Model (VG LLM). Our approach employs a 3D visual geometry encoder that extracts 3D prior information from video sequences. This information is integrated with visual tokens and fed into the MLLM. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has achieved substantial improvements in various tasks related to 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning, all directly learned from video sources. Impressively, our 4B model, which does not rely on explicit 3D data inputs, achieves competitive results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and even surpasses the Gemini-1.5-Pro in the VSI-Bench evaluations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of Large Language Model (LLMs) blocks with Vision Transformers (ViTs) holds immense promise for vision-only tasks by leveraging the rich semantic knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, a fundamental challenge lies in the inherent modality mismatch between text-centric pretraining of LLMs and vision-centric training of ViTs. Direct fusion often fails to fully exploit the LLM's potential and suffers from unstable finetuning. As a result, LLM blocks are kept frozen while only the vision components are learned. As a remedy to these challenges, we introduce Language-Unlocked Vision Transformers (LUViT), a novel approach that bridges this modality mismatch through a synergistic pre-training strategy. LUViT co-adapts a ViT backbone and an LLM fusion block by (1) employing Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) to pre-train the ViT for richer visual representations, and (2) concurrently training Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers within the LLM block using the MAE objective. This joint optimization guides the ViT to produce LLM-aligned features and the LLM to effectively interpret visual information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that LUViT significantly improves performance on various downstream vision tasks, showcasing a more effective and efficient pathway to harness LLM knowledge for visual understanding.

- **[Improving the Reasoning of Multi-Image Grounding in MLLMs via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00748)**  `arXiv:2507.00748`  `cs.CV`  
  _Bob Zhang, Haoran Li, Tao Zhang, Cilin Yan, Jiayin Cai, Xiaolong Jiang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual grounding in single-image scenarios with textual references. However, their performance degrades when handling real-world applications involving complex multi-image compositions and multimodal instructions, which reveals limitations in cross-image reasoning and generalization. To address these challenges, we adopt a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based post-training strategy to improve the reasoning performance of MLLMs in multi-image grounding tasks. Our approach begins with synthesizing high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data for cold-start initialization, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The cold-start training stage enables the model to identify correct solutions. Subsequently, we perform rejection sampling using the merged SFT model to curate high-quality RL data and leverage rule-based RL to guide the model toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving +9.04\% improvements on MIG-Bench and +4.98\% improvements on several out-of-domain reasoning grounding benchmarks over the SFT baseline. Furthermore, our approach exhibits strong generalization in multi-image perception, with gains of +3.1\% and +2.4\% over the base model on subsets of the BLINK and MMIU benchmarks, respectively.

  _Biao Wang, Wenwen Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters, two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets, and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly. Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However, experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities.

  We introduce the Llama-Nemotron series of models, an open family of heterogeneous reasoning models that deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities, inference efficiency, and an open license for enterprise use. The family comes in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report, we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models -- LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset: Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks through advanced prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), but their reliance on manually crafted, task-specific prompts limits adaptability and efficiency. We introduce Mixture of Reasoning (MoR), a training framework that embeds diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs for autonomous, task-adaptive reasoning without external prompt engineering. MoR has two phases: Thought Generation, creating reasoning chain templates with models like GPT-4o, and SFT Dataset Construction, pairing templates with benchmark datasets for supervisedthis http URLexperiments show that MoR significantly enhances performance, with MoR150 achieving 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT prompting and 0.734 (13.5% improvement) compared to baselines. MoR eliminates the need for task-specific prompts, offering a generalizable solution for robust reasoning across diverse tasks.

  Standard classification models often map inputs directly to labels without explicit reasoning, potentially limiting their performance, robustness, and interpretability. This paper introduces a novel two-stage approach to enhance text classification by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-generated reasonings. In the first stage, we fine-tune a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model (henceforth Llama-R-Gen) on a general-purpose reasoning dataset (syvai/reasoning-gen) to generate textual reasoning (R) given a question and its answer. In the second stage, this generally trained Llama-R-Gen is used offline to create an augmented training dataset for a downstream generative model. This downstream model, based on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, takes only the input text (Q) and is trained to output the generated reasoning (R) immediately followed by the predicted emotion (A). We demonstrate this methodology on the dair-ai/emotion dataset for emotion classification. Our experiments show that the generative model trained to output reasoning and the emotion (Classifier Q->RA) achieves a significant improvement of 8.7 percentage points in accuracy (for emotion prediction) compared to a baseline generative model trained solely to output the emotion (Classifier Q->A), highlighting the strong generalization capabilities of the reasoning generation and the benefit of explicit reasoning training. This work underscores the potential of LLM-generated reasonings for creating richer training datasets, thereby improving the performance of diverse downstream NLP tasks and providing explicit explanations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM) capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable $\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects. Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.

  Although mathematics is often considered culturally neutral, the way mathematical problems are presented can carry implicit cultural context. Existing benchmarks like GSM8K are predominantly rooted in Western norms, including names, currencies, and everyday scenarios. In this work, we create culturally adapted variants of the GSM8K test set for five regions Africa, India, China, Korea, and Japan using prompt-based transformations followed by manual verification. We evaluate six large language models (LLMs), ranging from 8B to 72B parameters, across five prompting strategies to assess their robustness to cultural variation in math problem presentation. Our findings reveal a consistent performance gap: models perform best on the original US-centric dataset and comparatively worse on culturally adapted versions. However, models with reasoning capabilities are more resilient to these shifts, suggesting that deeper reasoning helps bridge cultural presentation gaps in mathematical tasks

  This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate financial reports from time series data. We propose a framework encompassing prompt engineering, model selection, and evaluation. We introduce an automated highlighting system to categorize information within the generated reports, differentiating between insights derived directly from time series data, stemming from financial reasoning, and those reliant on external knowledge. This approach aids in evaluating the factual grounding and reasoning capabilities of the models. Our experiments, utilizing both data from the real stock market indices and synthetic time series, demonstrate the capability of LLMs to produce coherent and informative financial reports.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Implicit Sentiment Analysis (ISA) aims to infer sentiment that is implied rather than explicitly stated, requiring models to perform deeper reasoning over subtle contextual cues. While recent prompting-based methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in ISA, they often rely on majority voting over chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths without evaluating their causal validity, making them susceptible to internal biases and spurious correlations. To address this challenge, we propose CAPITAL, a causal prompting framework that incorporates front-door adjustment into CoT reasoning. CAPITAL decomposes the overall causal effect into two components: the influence of the input prompt on the reasoning chains, and the impact of those chains on the final output. These components are estimated using encoder-based clustering and the NWGM approximation, with a contrastive learning objective used to better align the encoder's representation with the LLM's reasoning space. Experiments on benchmark ISA datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that CAPITAL consistently outperforms strong prompting baselines in both accuracy and robustness, particularly under adversarial conditions. This work offers a principled approach to integrating causal inference into LLM prompting and highlights its benefits for bias-aware sentiment reasoning.

  Despite recent advances in Language Reasoning Models (LRMs), most research focuses solely on English, even though many models are pretrained on multilingual data. In this work, we investigate: Is English the most token-efficient language for reasoning? We evaluate three open-source RLMs: DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3, across four math datasets and seven typologically diverse languages. We find that reasoning in non-English languages not only reduces token usage, but also preserves accuracy. These gains persist even after translating the reasoning traces into English, suggesting genuine shifts in reasoning behavior rather than surface-level linguistic effects. The extent of improvement, however, depends on the models multilingual strength. Our findings motivate a broader view of reasoning in language models, highlighting the potential of multilingual reasoning and the importance of strong multilingual foundations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in mathematical reasoning, strategic reasoning for LLMs using RL remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic reasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's output move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our experiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform sparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below expert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and find evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained models' internal understanding of chess--a deficit which RL alone may not be able to fully overcome.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at solving complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but their decision-making processes remain somewhat blackbox. We introduce textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a 4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy (74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance. Our work creates new avenues for transparent AI systems and closes significant gaps in AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.

  The push to compress and impart the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) into more deployable and efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) has benefited from improvements in knowledge distillation (KD) techniques. These techniques allow a smaller student model to learn from a more capable and larger teacher model's responses. However, distillation often revolves around the student model merely copying the teacher's in-distribution responses, limiting its generalisability. This limitation is amplified on reasoning tasks and can be computationally expensive. In this study, we propose AdvDistill, a reward-guided dataset distillation framework. We utilise multiple generations (responses) from a teacher for each prompt and assign rewards based on rule-based verifiers. These varying and normally distributed rewards serve as weights when training student models. Our methods and their subsequent behavioural analysis demonstrate a significant improvement in student model performance for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks, showcasing the efficacy and benefits of incorporating a rewarding mechanism in dataset distillation processes.

  Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision. Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online, multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training. Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6% improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000 expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation, and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous reasoning development.

  Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to assist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is the ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time. Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an autonomous research agent.

  Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week, it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20 open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for advancing reasoning models.

  We introduce ASTRO, the "Autoregressive Search-Taught Reasoner", a framework for training language models to reason like search algorithms, explicitly leveraging self-reflection, backtracking, and exploration in their outputs. Recently, training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) has led to the advent of reasoning models with greatly enhanced reasoning capabilities. Open-source replications of reasoning models, while successful, build upon models that already exhibit strong reasoning capabilities along with search behavior observed even before RL. As a result, it is yet unclear how to boost the reasoning capabilities of other non-reasoner models including Llama 3. ASTRO teaches such models to internalize structured search behavior through a synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over mathematical problem-solving trajectories. By converting search traces into natural language chain-of-thoughts that capture both successes and recoveries from failure, ASTRO bootstraps models with a rich prior for exploration during RL. We finetune our models on these search-derived traces and further improve performance via RL with verifiable rewards. We apply ASTRO to the Llama 3 family of models and achieve absolute performance gains of 16.0% on MATH-500, 26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially improving upon challenging problems that require iterative correction. Our results demonstrate that search-inspired training offers a principled way to instill robust reasoning capabilities into open LLMs.

  Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5, DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models, and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies, including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular, interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning, and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.

  Solving algebraic word problems (AWPs) has recently emerged as an important natural language processing task. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful mathematical capabilities, and the Chain-of-Thought technique, which guides LLMs through step-by-step reasoning, has yielded impressive results. However, this reasoning ability is limited by the computational weaknesses of LLMs themselves, where calculation errors can accumulate, leading to incorrect final answers. To address this, we propose Program of Equations Thoughts (POET), which transforms the task of generating step-by-step reasoning answers into a two-stage task of predicting equations and generating code, offloading complex computations to a Python interpreter to avoid calculation errors in LLMs. Furthermore, we propose Zero-shot POET, which utilizes a manually designed template to enable LLMs to directly generate Python code for one-step solving. Our method achieves accuracies of 95.3% and 98.0% on the PEN and ALG514 datasets, respectively, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Zero-shot POET also achieves the SOTA result of 95.5% on the DRAW-1K dataset.

  Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled unified processing of language, vision, and structured inputs, opening the door to complex tasks such as logical deduction, spatial reasoning, and scientific analysis. Despite their promise, the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, particularly those augmented with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T), remain poorly understood and lack standardized evaluation benchmarks. Existing work focuses primarily on perception or final answer correctness, offering limited insight into how models reason or fail across modalities. To address this gap, we introduce the MMMR, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking. The MMMR comprises 1) a high-difficulty dataset of 1,083 questions spanning six diverse reasoning types with symbolic depth and multi-hop demands and 2) a modular Reasoning Trace Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP) for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy through metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotations. Empirical results show that MLLMs-T overall outperform non-thinking counterparts, but even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5 Pro suffer from reasoning pathologies such as inconsistency and overthinking. This benchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and provides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development. Overall, the MMMR offers a scalable foundation for evaluating, comparing, and improving the next generation of multi-modal reasoning systems.
