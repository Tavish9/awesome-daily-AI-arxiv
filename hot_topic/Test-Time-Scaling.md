- **[When Engineering Outruns Intelligence: A Re-evaluation of Instruction-Guided Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20021)**  `arXiv:2507.20021`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  Large language models (LLMs) are often credited with recent leaps in ObjectGoal Navigation, yet the extent to which they improve planning remains unclear. We revisit this question on the HM3D-v1 validation split. First, we strip InstructNav of its Dynamic Chain-of-Navigation prompt, open-vocabulary GLEE detector and Intuition saliency map, and replace them with a simple Distance-Weighted Frontier Explorer (DWFE). This geometry-only heuristic raises Success from 58.0% to 61.1% and lifts SPL from 20.9% to 36.0% over 2 000 validation episodes, outperforming all previous training-free baselines. Second, we add a lightweight language prior (SHF); on a 200-episode subset this yields a further +2% Success and +0.9% SPL while shortening paths by five steps on average. Qualitative trajectories confirm the trend: InstructNav back-tracks and times-out, DWFE reaches the goal after a few islands, and SHF follows an almost straight route. Our results indicate that frontier geometry, not emergent LLM reasoning, drives most reported gains, and suggest that metric-aware prompts or offline semantic graphs are necessary before attributing navigation success to "LLM intelligence."

  Performing robotic grasping from a cluttered bin based on human instructions is a challenging task, as it requires understanding both the nuances of free-form language and the spatial relationships between objects. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data, such as GPT-4o, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across both text and images. But can they truly be used for this task in a zero-shot setting? And what are their limitations? In this paper, we explore these research questions via the free-form language-based robotic grasping task, and propose a novel method, FreeGrasp, leveraging the pre-trained VLMs' world knowledge to reason about human instructions and object spatial arrangements. Our method detects all objects as keypoints and uses these keypoints to annotate marks on images, aiming to facilitate GPT-4o's zero-shot spatial reasoning. This allows our method to determine whether a requested object is directly graspable or if other objects must be grasped and removed first. Since no existing dataset is specifically designed for this task, we introduce a synthetic dataset FreeGraspData by extending the MetaGraspNetV2 dataset with human-annotated instructions and ground-truth grasping sequences. We conduct extensive analyses with both FreeGraspData and real-world validation with a gripper-equipped robotic arm, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in grasp reasoning and execution.

- **[A Human-in-the-loop Approach to Robot Action Replanning through LLM Common-Sense Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20870)**  `arXiv:2507.20870`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To facilitate the wider adoption of robotics, accessible programming tools are required for non-experts. Observational learning enables intuitive human skills transfer through hands-on demonstrations, but relying solely on visual input can be inefficient in terms of scalability and failure mitigation, especially when based on a single demonstration. This paper presents a human-in-the-loop method for enhancing the robot execution plan, automatically generated based on a single RGB video, with natural language input to a Large Language Model (LLM). By including user-specified goals or critical task aspects and exploiting the LLM common-sense reasoning, the system adjusts the vision-based plan to prevent potential failures and adapts it based on the received instructions. Experiments demonstrated the framework intuitiveness and effectiveness in correcting vision-derived errors and adapting plans without requiring additional demonstrations. Moreover, interactive plan refinement and hallucination corrections promoted system robustness.

  Visual imitation learning (VIL) provides an efficient and intuitive strategy for robotic systems to acquire novel skills. Recent advancements in foundation models, particularly Vision Language Models (VLMs), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual and linguistic reasoning for VIL tasks. Despite this progress, existing approaches primarily utilize these models for learning high-level plans from human demonstrations, relying on pre-defined motion primitives for executing physical interactions, which remains a major bottleneck for robotic systems. In this work, we present FMimic, a novel paradigm that harnesses foundation models to directly learn generalizable skills at even fine-grained action levels, using only a limited number of human videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FMimic delivers strong performance with a single human video, and significantly outperforms all other methods with five videos. Furthermore, our method exhibits significant improvements of over 39% and 29% in RLBench multi-task experiments and real-world manipulation tasks, respectively, and exceeds baselines by more than 34% in high-precision tasks and 47% in long-horizon tasks.

  Robotic platforms have become essential for marine operations by providing regular and continuous access to offshore assets, such as underwater infrastructure inspection, environmental monitoring, and resource exploration. However, the complex and dynamic nature of underwater environments, characterized by limited visibility, unpredictable currents, and communication constraints, presents significant challenges that demand advanced autonomy while ensuring operator trust and oversight. Central to addressing these challenges are knowledge representation and reasoning techniques, particularly knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, that enable robots to efficiently structure, retrieve, and interpret complex environmental data. These capabilities empower robotic agents to reason, adapt, and respond effectively to changing conditions. The primary goal of this work is to demonstrate both multi-agent autonomy and shared autonomy, where multiple robotic agents operate independently while remaining connected to a human supervisor. We show how a RAG-powered large language model, augmented with knowledge graph data and domain taxonomy, enables autonomous multi-agent decision-making and facilitates seamless human-robot interaction, resulting in 100\% mission validation and behavior completeness. Finally, ablation studies reveal that without structured knowledge from the graph and/or taxonomy, the LLM is prone to hallucinations, which can compromise decision quality.

- **[LoRA-PAR: A Flexible Dual-System LoRA Partitioning Approach to Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20999)**  `arXiv:2507.20999`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Yining Huang, Bin Li, Keke Tang, Meilian Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefit substantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing their performance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameter fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost, most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.

- **[Dissecting Persona-Driven Reasoning in Language Models via Activation Patching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20936)**  `arXiv:2507.20936`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Ansh Poonia, Maeghal Jain_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable versatility in adopting diverse personas. In this study, we examine how assigning a persona influences a model's reasoning on an objective task. Using activation patching, we take a first step toward understanding how key components of the model encode persona-specific information. Our findings reveal that the early Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers attend not only to the syntactic structure of the input but also process its semantic content. These layers transform persona tokens into richer representations, which are then used by the middle Multi-Head Attention (MHA) layers to shape the model's output. Additionally, we identify specific attention heads that disproportionately attend to racial and color-based identities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models' intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For federated learning (FL) algorithms such as FedSAM, their generalization capability is crucial for real-word applications. In this paper, we revisit the generalization problem in FL and investigate the impact of data heterogeneity on FL generalization. We find that FedSAM usually performs worse than FedAvg in the case of highly heterogeneous data, and thus propose a novel and effective federated learning algorithm with Stochastic Weight Averaging (called \texttt{FedSWA}), which aims to find flatter minima in the setting of highly heterogeneous data. Moreover, we introduce a new momentum-based stochastic controlled weight averaging FL algorithm (\texttt{FedMoSWA}), which is designed to better align local and global models.Theoretically, we provide both convergence analysis and generalization bounds for \texttt{FedSWA} and \texttt{FedMoSWA}. We also prove that the optimization and generalization errors of \texttt{FedMoSWA} are smaller than those of their counterparts, including FedSAM and its variants. Empirically, experimental results on CIFAR10/100 and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms compared to their counterparts. Open source code at:this https URL.

  The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents promising opportunities for automation and enhancement in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). However, comprehensively evaluating these models in circuit design remains challenging due to the narrow scope of existing benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMCircuitEval, the first multimodal benchmark specifically designed to assess MLLM performance comprehensively across diverse EDA tasks. MMCircuitEval comprises 3614 meticulously curated question-answer (QA) pairs spanning digital and analog circuits across critical EDA stages - ranging from general knowledge and specifications to front-end and back-end design. Derived from textbooks, technical question banks, datasheets, and real-world documentation, each QA pair undergoes rigorous expert review for accuracy and relevance. Our benchmark uniquely categorizes questions by design stage, circuit type, tested abilities (knowledge, comprehension, reasoning, computation), and difficulty level, enabling detailed analysis of model capabilities and limitations. Extensive evaluations reveal significant performance gaps among existing LLMs, particularly in back-end design and complex computations, highlighting the critical need for targeted training datasets and modeling approaches. MMCircuitEval provides a foundational resource for advancing MLLMs in EDA, facilitating their integration into real-world circuit design workflows. Our benchmark is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However, the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor, which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Img2LaTeX is a practically significant task that involves converting mathematical expressions or tabular data from images into LaTeX code. In recent years, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a variety of visual understanding tasks, owing to their generalization capabilities. While some studies have explored the use of VLMs for the Img2LaTeX task, their performance often falls short of expectations. Empirically, VLMs sometimes struggle with fine-grained visual elements, leading to inaccurate LaTeX predictions. To address this challenge, we propose $A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework, enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve prediction quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset, Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$ significantly improves model performance across six evaluation metrics spanning both textual and visual levels, consistently outperforming other baseline methods; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and human evaluations validate the practical effectiveness of our approach, as well as the strong synergy among its core components during inference.

- **[Enhancing Spatial Reasoning through Visual and Textual Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20529)**  `arXiv:2507.20529`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in 2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) extend the conventional large language models by integrating visual data, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and significantly broadens the practical applications of AI. However, including visual inputs also brings new challenges in maintaining data quality. Empirical evidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training examples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the quantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data filtration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality image-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters potential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment. Unlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on top of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent evaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates the need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model efficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text alignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that datasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on par with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through high-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust solution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\ \textbf{Availability and implementation:} Our compact VLM filtration model, training data, utility scripts, and Supplementary data (Appendices) are freely available atthis https URL.

  Moving target detection is a challenging computer vision task aimed at generating accurate segmentation maps in diverse in-the-wild color videos captured by static cameras. If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously extracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich annotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep models. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for color image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular Value Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1 quaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels. In this paper, we reduce the computational complexity of QSVD to o(1) by utilizing a quaternion Riemannian manifold. Furthermor, we propose the universal QRPCA (uQRPCA) framework, which achieves a balance in simultaneously segmenting targets and recovering backgrounds from color videos. Moreover, we expand to uQRPCA+ by introducing the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method to further process and obtain the ideal low-rank background across color channels. Experiments demonstrate our uQRPCA+ achieves State Of The Art (SOTA) performance on moving target detection and background recovery tasks compared to existing open-source methods.

  _Mandar Kulkarni_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image-based product attribute prediction in e-commerce is a crucial task with numerous applications. The supervised fine-tuning of Vision Language Models (VLMs) faces significant scale challenges due to the cost of manual or API based annotation. In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised fine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage unlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Beginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ PEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with unlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled sample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on self-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated model for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method achieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset spanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes only unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised model. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that accuracy with DPO training improves with more unlabeled data, indicating that a large pool of unlabeled samples can be effectively leveraged to improve performance.

  _Melissa Cote, Alexandra Branzan Albu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) was recently proposed as an alternative to query-by-example (QBE) searches, the dominant document image retrieval (DIR) paradigm. One drawback of QBE searches is that they require sample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer users a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual features of document contents, describing document images with combinations of visual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based binary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI to bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a use case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize that text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document images using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE, which usesthis http URLas the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough description of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style attributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional QBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the document images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents. Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our hypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document image retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at utilizing T2I generation for DIR.

  _Weicheng Zheng, Xiaofei Mao, Nanfei Ye, Pengxiang Li, Kun Zhan, Xianpeng Lang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing autonomous driving, yet their potential is constrained by myopic decision-making and passive perception, limiting reliability in complex environments. We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making. DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models, such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual evidence, paving a path toward safer and more intelligent autonomous systems.

  Building footprint extraction holds immense significance in remote sensing image analysis and has great value in urban planning, land use, environmental protection and disaster assessment. Despite the progress made by conventional and deep learning approaches in this field, they continue to encounter significant challenges. This paper introduces a novel plug-and-play attention module, Split Coordinate Attention (SCA), which ingeniously captures spatially remote interactions by employing two spatial range of pooling kernels, strategically encoding each channel along x and y planes, and separately performs a series of split operations for each feature group, thus enabling more efficient semantic feature extraction. By inserting into a 2D CNN to form an effective SCANet, our SCANet outperforms recent SOTA methods on the public Wuhan University (WHU) Building Dataset and Massachusetts Building Dataset in terms of various metrics. Particularly SCANet achieves the best IoU, 91.61% and 75.49% for the two datasets. Our code is available atthis https URL

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through multi-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be optimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF substantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised fine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely visual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable reasoning models without requiring explicit supervision.

- **[Detecting Visual Information Manipulation Attacks in Augmented Reality: A Multimodal Semantic Reasoning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20356)**  `arXiv:2507.20356`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yanming Xiu, Maria Gorlatova_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes: information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information. Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM. It consists of 452 raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world AR scenario. To detect such attacks, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only and text-only baselines. The system reaches an average attack detection latency of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.

  Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in general video understanding. However, existing models primarily focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses, restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video and image understanding.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semantic querying in complex 3D scenes through free-form language presents a significant challenge. Existing 3D scene understanding methods use large-scale training data and CLIP to align text queries with 3D semantic features. However, their reliance on predefined vocabulary priors from training data hinders free-form semantic querying. Besides, recent advanced methods rely on LLMs for scene understanding but lack comprehensive 3D scene-level information and often overlook the potential inconsistencies in LLM-generated outputs. In our paper, we propose FreeQ-Graph, which enables Free-form Querying with a semantic consistent scene Graph for 3D scene understanding. The core idea is to encode free-form queries from a complete and accurate 3D scene graph without predefined vocabularies, and to align them with 3D consistent semantic labels, which accomplished through three key steps. We initiate by constructing a complete and accurate 3D scene graph that maps free-form objects and their relations through LLM and LVLM guidance, entirely free from training data or predefined priors. Most importantly, we align graph nodes with accurate semantic labels by leveraging 3D semantic aligned features from merged superpoints, enhancing 3D semantic consistency. To enable free-form semantic querying, we then design an LLM-based reasoning algorithm that combines scene-level and object-level information to intricate reasoning. We conducted extensive experiments on 3D semantic grounding, segmentation, and complex querying tasks, while also validating the accuracy of graph generation. Experiments on 6 datasets show that our model excels in both complex free-form semantic queries and intricate relational reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses the inherent limitations of conventional bottleneck structures (diminished instance discriminability due to overemphasis on batch statistics) and decoupled heads (computational redundancy) in object detection frameworks by proposing two novel modules: the Instance-Specific Bottleneck with full-channel global self-attention (ISB) and the Instance-Specific Asymmetric Decoupled Head (ISADH). The ISB module innovatively reconstructs feature maps to establish an efficient full-channel global attention mechanism through synergistic fusion of batch-statistical and instance-specific features. Complementing this, the ISADH module pioneers an asymmetric decoupled architecture enabling hierarchical multi-dimensional feature integration via dual-stream batch-instance representation fusion. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate that the coordinated deployment of ISB and ISADH in the YOLO-PRO framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across all computational scales. Specifically, YOLO-PRO surpasses YOLOv8 by 1.0-1.6% AP (N/S/M/L/X scales) and outperforms YOLO11 by 0.1-0.5% AP in critical N/M/L/X groups, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. This work provides practical insights for developing high-precision detectors deployable on edge devices.

  Recent advancements in 3D generation models have opened new possibilities for simulating dynamic 3D object movements and customizing behaviors, yet creating this content remains challenging. Current methods often require manual assignment of precise physical properties for simulations or rely on video generation models to predict them, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we rethink the usage of multi-modal large language model (MLLM) in physics-based simulation, and present Sim Anything, a physics-based approach that endows static 3D objects with interactive dynamics. We begin with detailed scene reconstruction and object-level 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, progressing to multi-view image in-painting. Inspired by human visual reasoning, we propose MLLM-based Physical Property Perception (MLLM-P3) to predict mean physical properties of objects in a zero-shot manner. Based on the mean values and the object's geometry, the Material Property Distribution Prediction model (MPDP) model then estimates the full distribution, reformulating the problem as probability distribution estimation to reduce computational costs. Finally, we simulate objects in an open-world scene with particles sampled via the Physical-Geometric Adaptive Sampling (PGAS) strategy, efficiently capturing complex deformations and significantly reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate our Sim Anything achieves more realistic motion than state-of-the-art methods within 2 minutes on a single GPU.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit considerable promise in financial applications; however, prevailing models frequently demonstrate limitations when confronted with scenarios that necessitate sophisticated reasoning capabilities, stringent trustworthiness criteria, and efficient adaptation to domain-specific requirements. We introduce the Agentar-Fin-R1 series of financial large language models (8B and 32B parameters), specifically engineered based on the Qwen3 foundation model to enhance reasoning capabilities, reliability, and domain specialization for financial applications. Our optimization approach integrates a high-quality, systematic financial task label system with a comprehensive multi-layered trustworthiness assurance framework. This framework encompasses high-quality trustworthy knowledge engineering, multi-agent trustworthy data synthesis, and rigorous data validation governance. Through label-guided automated difficulty-aware optimization, tow-stage training pipeline, and dynamic attribution systems, we achieve substantial improvements in training efficiency. Our models undergo comprehensive evaluation on mainstream financial benchmarks including Fineva, FinEval, and FinanceIQ, as well as general reasoning datasets such as MATH-500 and GPQA-diamond. To thoroughly assess real-world deployment capabilities, we innovatively propose the Finova evaluation benchmark, which focuses on agent-level financial reasoning and compliance verification. Experimental results demonstrate that Agentar-Fin-R1 not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on financial tasks but also exhibits exceptional general reasoning capabilities, validating its effectiveness as a trustworthy solution for high-stakes financial applications.

  Automated data visualization plays a crucial role in simplifying data interpretation, enhancing decision-making, and improving efficiency. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating visualizations from natural language, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks limits the rigorous evaluation of their capabilities. We introduce Text2Vis, a benchmark designed to assess text-to-visualization models, covering 20+ chart types and diverse data science queries, including trend analysis, correlation, outlier detection, and predictive analytics. It comprises 1,985 samples, each with a data table, natural language query, short answer, visualization code, and annotated charts. The queries involve complex reasoning, conversational turns, and dynamic data retrieval. We benchmark 11 open-source and closed-source models, revealing significant performance gaps, highlighting key challenges, and offering insights for future advancements. To close this gap, we propose the first cross-modal actor-critic agentic framework that jointly refines the textual answer and visualization code, increasing GPT-4o`s pass rate from 26% to 42% over the direct approach and improving chart quality. We also introduce an automated LLM-based evaluation framework that enables scalable assessment across thousands of samples without human annotation, measuring answer correctness, code execution success, visualization readability, and chart accuracy. We release Text2Vis atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, including geospatial knowledge, which has been successfully applied to various geospatial tasks such as mobility prediction and social indicator prediction. However, LLMs often generate inaccurate geospatial knowledge, leading to geospatial hallucinations (incorrect or inconsistent representations of geospatial information) that compromise their reliability. While the phenomenon of general knowledge hallucination in LLMs has been widely studied, the systematic evaluation and mitigation of geospatial hallucinations remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework for geospatial hallucinations, leveraging structured geospatial knowledge graphs for controlled assessment. Through extensive evaluation across 20 advanced LLMs, we uncover the hallucinations in their geospatial knowledge. Building on these insights, we introduce a dynamic factuality aligning method based on Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to mitigate geospatial hallucinations in LLMs, leading to a performance improvement of over 29.6% on the proposed benchmark. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and learning algorithm in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in geospatial knowledge and reasoning tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Background: Despite the current ubiquity of Large Language Models (LLMs) across the medical domain, there is a surprising lack of studies which address their reasoning behaviour. We emphasise the importance of understanding reasoning behaviour as opposed to high-level prediction accuracies, since it is equivalent to explainable AI (XAI) in this context. In particular, achieving XAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact across the healthcare sector. Results: Therefore, in this work, we adapt the existing concept of reasoning behaviour and articulate its interpretation within the specific context of medical LLMs. We survey and categorise current state-of-the-art approaches for modeling and evaluating reasoning reasoning in medical LLMs. Additionally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can empower medical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight into the low-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models. We also outline key open challenges facing the development of Large Reasoning Models. Conclusion: The subsequent increased transparency and trust in medical machine learning models by clinicians as well as patients will accelerate the integration, application as well as further development of medical AI for the healthcare system as a whole.

  Current research efforts are focused on enhancing the thinking and reasoning capability of large language model (LLM) by prompting, data-driven emergence and inference-time computation. In this study, we consider stimulating language model's thinking and cognitive abilities from a modular perspective, which mimics the human brain architecture. We select a specific intermediate attention layer with newly implemented language heads. We conduct dual-layer fine-tuning by annotated (query, thought, answer) samples and show that the intermediate layer can also learn to decode fluent and reasonable language tokens. A two-pass inference mechanism is designed to generate thoughts then formal responses. The entire framework is called modularized thinking language model (MeTHanol) which can enhance LLM's cognitive behaviors as indicated by Theory of Mind (ToM) and Vignette-based experiments. Case studies also show that MeTHanol can plan and self-reflect and generate human-like thoughts and answers, even on unseen and open-domain tasks. MeTHanol can also adapt to a personalized prompt and behave as the specified character. Our study holds promise for significant cognitive gains from a modular perspective.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge. We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs) that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the potential of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to enhance reasoning capabilities through extended output sequences. However, traditional RL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to long-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To address these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement Learning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning abilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short segments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail samples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive Tokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment rollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with 128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\% to 85.1\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\% to 61.9\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B with remarkable gains. These findings underscore the potential of our methods to advance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with ultra-long sequence generation. We will release our code and model for further use by the community.

  _A. Bochkov_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational "meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic, precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable, semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to "representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated vast capabilities on generative tasks in recent years, yet they struggle with guaranteeing the factual correctness of the generated content. This makes these models unreliable in realistic situations where factually accurate responses are expected. In this paper, we propose FactReasoner, a new factuality assessor that relies on probabilistic reasoning to assess the factuality of a long-form generated response. Specifically, FactReasoner decomposes the response into atomic units, retrieves relevant contexts for them from an external knowledge source, and constructs a joint probability distribution over the atoms and contexts using probabilistic encodings of the logical relationships (entailment, contradiction) between the textual utterances corresponding to the atoms and contexts. FactReasoner then computes the posterior probability of whether atomic units in the response are supported by the retrieved contexts. Our experiments on labeled and unlabeled benchmark datasets demonstrate clearly that FactReasoner improves considerably over state-of-the-art prompt-based approaches in terms of both factual precision and recall.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We challenge the prevailing assumption that complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs) necessitates massive training data. We demonstrate that sophisticated mathematical reasoning can emerge with only a few examples. Specifically, through simple supervised fine-tuning, our model, LIMO, achieves 63.3\% accuracy on AIME24 and 95.6\% on MATH500, surpassing previous fine-tuned models (6.5\% on AIME24, 59.2\% on MATH500) while using only 1\% of the training data required by prior approaches. Furthermore, LIMO exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization, achieving a 45.8\% absolute improvement across diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x more data. Synthesizing these findings, we propose the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has been comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning can emerge through minimal but strategically designed demonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis suggests that the threshold for eliciting complex reasoning is not dictated by task complexity but rather by two key factors: (1) the completeness of the model's pre-trained knowledge base and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples in serving as "cognitive templates" that guide reasoning.

  Medical reports contain rich clinical information but are often unstructured and written in domain-specific language, posing challenges for information extraction. While proprietary large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in clinical natural language processing, their lack of transparency and data privacy concerns limit their utility in healthcare. This study therefore evaluates nine open-source generative LLMs on the DRAGON benchmark, which includes 28 clinical information extraction tasks in Dutch. We developed \texttt{llm\_extractinator}, a publicly available framework for information extraction using open-source generative LLMs, and used it to assess model performance in a zero-shot setting. Several 14 billion parameter models, Phi-4-14B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and DeepSeek-R1-14B, achieved competitive results, while the bigger Llama-3.3-70B model achieved slightly higher performance at greater computational cost. Translation to English prior to inference consistently degraded performance, highlighting the need of native-language processing. These findings demonstrate that open-source LLMs, when used with our framework, offer effective, scalable, and privacy-conscious solutions for clinical information extraction in low-resource settings.

  The demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated mathematical reasoning is growing across industries. However, the development of performant mathematical LLMs is critically bottlenecked by the scarcity of difficult, novel training data. We introduce \textbf{SAND-Math} (Synthetic Augmented Novel and Difficult Mathematics problems and solutions), a pipeline that addresses this by first generating high-quality problems from scratch and then systematically elevating their complexity via a new \textbf{Difficulty Hiking} step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two key findings. First, augmenting a strong baseline with SAND-Math data significantly boosts performance, outperforming the next-best synthetic dataset by \textbf{$\uparrow$ 17.85 absolute points} on the AIME25 benchmark. Second, in a dedicated ablation study, we show our Difficulty Hiking process is highly effective: by increasing average problem difficulty from 5.02 to 5.98, this step lifts AIME25 performance from 46.38\% to 49.23\%. The full generation pipeline, final dataset, and a fine-tuned model form a practical and scalable toolkit for building more capable and efficient mathematical reasoning LLMs. SAND-Math dataset is released here: \href{this https URL}{this https URL}

  _Kang Yang, Jingxue Chen, Qingkun Tang, Tianxiang Zhang, Qianchun Lu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in effectively leveraging sequential environmental feedback (EF) signals, such as natural language evaluations, for feedback-independent chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Existing approaches either convert EF into scalar rewards, losing rich contextual information, or employ refinement datasets, failing to exploit the multi-step and discrete nature of EF interactions. To address these limitations, we propose MoL-RL, a novel training paradigm that integrates multi-step EF signals into LLMs through a dual-objective optimization framework. Our method combines MoL (Mixture-of-Losses) continual training, which decouples domain-specific EF signals (optimized via cross-entropy loss) and general language capabilities (preserved via Kullback-Leibler divergence), with GRPO-based post-training to distill sequential EF interactions into single-step inferences. This synergy enables robust feedback-independent reasoning without relying on external feedback loops. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning (MATH-500, AIME24/AIME25) and code generation (CodeAgent-Test) benchmarks demonstrate that MoL-RL achieves state-of-the-art performance with the Qwen3-8B model, while maintaining strong generalization across model scales (Qwen3-4B). This work provides a promising approach for leveraging multi-step textual feedback to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities in diverse domains.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large reasoning models (LRM) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities have shown strong performance on objective tasks, such as math reasoning and coding. However, their effectiveness on subjective questions that may have different responses from different perspectives is still limited by a tendency towards homogeneous reasoning, introduced by the reliance on a single ground truth in supervised fine-tuning and verifiable reward in reinforcement learning. Motivated by the finding that increasing role perspectives consistently improves performance, we propose MultiRole-R1, a diversity-enhanced framework with multiple role perspectives, to improve the accuracy and diversity in subjective reasoning tasks. MultiRole-R1 features an unsupervised data construction pipeline that generates reasoning chains that incorporate diverse role perspectives. We further employ reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with reward shaping, by taking diversity as a reward signal in addition to the verifiable reward. With specially designed reward functions, we successfully promote perspective diversity and lexical diversity, uncovering a positive relation between reasoning diversity and accuracy. Our experiment on six benchmarks demonstrates MultiRole-R1's effectiveness and generalizability in enhancing both subjective and objective reasoning, showcasing the potential of diversity-enhanced training in LRMs.

  Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown the potential to revolutionize healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, optimizing workflows, and personalizing treatment plans. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable advancements in natural language processing and medical applications. However, the evaluation of these models has focused predominantly on the English language, leading to potential biases in their performance across different languages.This study investigates the capability of six LLMs (GPT-4.0 Turbo, LLaMA-3-8B, LLaMA-3-70B, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Titan Text G1-Express, and Command R+) and four MLLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3-Opus, Claude-3-Sonnet, and Claude-3-Haiku) to answer questions written in Brazilian spoken portuguese from the medical residency entrance exam of the Hospital das Cl√≠nicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S√£o Paulo (HCFMUSP) - the largest health complex in South America. The performance of the models was benchmarked against human candidates, analyzing accuracy, processing time, and coherence of the generated explanations.The results show that while some models, particularly Claude-3.5-Sonnet and Claude-3-Opus, achieved accuracy levels comparable to human candidates, performance gaps persist, particularly in multimodal questions requiring image interpretation. Furthermore, the study highlights language disparities, emphasizing the need for further fine-tuning and data set augmentation for non-English medical AI applications.Our findings reinforce the importance of evaluating generative AI in various linguistic and clinical settings to ensure a fair and reliable deployment in healthcare.

  Mathematical reasoning is a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence and a primary benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). While state-of-the-art models show promise, they often falter when faced with complex problems that demand deep conceptual understanding and intricate, multi-step deliberation. To address this challenge, we introduce JT-Math-8B, a series of open-source models comprising base, instruct, and thinking versions, built upon a systematic, multi-stage optimization framework. Our pre-training corpus is a high-quality, 210B-token dataset curated through a dedicated data pipeline that uses model-based validation to ensure quality and diversity. The Instruct Model is optimized for direct, concise answers through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a GRPO-based reinforcement learning (RL) method. The Thinking Model is trained for complex problem-solving using a Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) approach, combining SFT with a novel, multi-stage RL curriculum that progressively increases task difficulty and context length up to 32K tokens. JT-Math-8B achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models of similar size, surpassing prominent models like OpenAI's O1-mini and GPT-4o , and demonstrating superior performance on competition-level mathematics.

  The intersection of AI and legal systems presents a growing need for tools that support legal education, particularly in under-resourced languages such as Romanian. In this work, we aim to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding and reasoning about Romanian driving law through textual and visual question-answering tasks. To facilitate this, we introduce RoD-TAL, a novel multimodal dataset comprising Romanian driving test questions, text-based and image-based, alongside annotated legal references and human explanations. We implement and assess retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, dense retrievers, and reasoning-optimized models across tasks including Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering (QA), Visual IR, and Visual QA. Our experiments demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances retrieval performance. At the same time, chain-of-thought prompting and specialized reasoning models improve QA accuracy, surpassing the minimum grades required to pass driving exams. However, visual reasoning remains challenging, highlighting the potential and the limitations of applying LLMs and VLMs to legal education.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively improves the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, retrieval noises significantly impact the quality of LLMs' generation, necessitating the development of denoising mechanisms. Previous methods extract evidence straightforwardly without explicit thinking, which risks filtering out key clues and struggles with generalization. To this end, we propose LEAR, which learns to extract rational evidence by (1) explicitly reasoning to identify potential cues within retrieval contents first, and then (2) consciously extracting to avoid omitting any key cues helpful for answering questions. Specifically, we frame evidence reasoning and evidence extraction into one unified response for end-to-end training; apply knowledge token masks for disentanglement to derive reasoning-based and extraction-based answers; and devise three types of verifiable reward functions, including answer, length, and format, to update the model via the policy optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of LEAR, providing compact and high-quality evidence, improving the accuracy of downstream tasks, and promoting effective application in online RAG systems.

  Achieving human-like reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has long been a goal. Current methods primarily focus on synthesizing positive rationales, typically relying on manual annotations or complex systems. Moreover, they often overlook negative reasoning, which limits the model's generalization ability and robustness in multimodal inference. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework: \textbf{S}elf-Aligning \textbf{M}ultimodal Reasoning with \textbf{A}nswer-O\textbf{r}iented Chain-of-\textbf{T}hought (SMART). SMART employs an answer-oriented chain-of-thought (AoT) prompt to automatically construct high-quality data. Drawing inspiration from human proof-based strategies, AoT leverages both correct and incorrect answers to extract key visual information that links questions and answers. When provided with correct answers, the model produces strong positive rationales. Conversely, when correct answers are replaced with incorrect alternatives, the model generates an erroneous yet compelling reasoning path, serving as a form of discriminative negative rationale. Models trained with AoT-generated data outperform those trained on manually annotated datasets, demonstrating superior reasoning capabilities. Consequently, SMART establishes an iterative generation-optimization method that continually enhances the model's reasoning skills. Experiments indicate that the SMART framework significantly improves various MLLMs, regardless of model architecture, parameter size, or pre-training dataset. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Recent advancements in post-training methodologies for large language models (LLMs) have highlighted reinforcement learning (RL) as a critical component for enhancing reasoning. However, the substantial computational costs associated with RL-based approaches have led to growing interest in alternative paradigms, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of DPO in facilitating self-improvement for LLMs through iterative preference-based learning. We demonstrate that a single round of DPO with coarse filtering significantly enhances mathematical reasoning performance, particularly for strong base model. Furthermore, we design an iterative enhancement framework for both the generator and the reward model (RM), enabling their mutual improvement through online interaction across multiple rounds of DPO. Finally, with simple verifiable rewards, our model DPO-VP achieves RL-level performance with significantly lower computational overhead. These findings highlight DPO as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to RL, offering a practical solution for enhancing LLM reasoning in resource-constrained situations.

  While it is commonly accepted that maintaining common ground plays a role in conversational success, little prior research exists connecting conversational grounding to success in task-oriented conversations. We study failures of grounding in the Ubuntu IRC dataset, where participants use text-only communication to resolve technical issues. We find that disruptions in conversational flow often stem from a misalignment in common ground, driven by a divergence in beliefs and assumptions held by participants. These disruptions, which we call conversational friction, significantly correlate with task success. We find that although LLMs can identify overt cases of conversational friction, they struggle with subtler and more context-dependent instances requiring pragmatic or domain-specific reasoning.

  Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks requiring multi-step logical reasoning capabilities, such as automated theorem proving. However, challenges persist within theorem proving, such as the identification of key mathematical concepts, understanding their interrelationships, and formalizing proofs correctly within natural language. We present KG-prover, a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs mined from reputable mathematical texts to augment general-purpose LLMs to construct and formalize mathematical proofs. We also study the effects of scaling graph-based, test-time compute using KG-Prover, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baselines across multiple datasets. General-purpose LLMs improve up to 21\% on miniF2F-test when combined with KG-Prover, with consistent improvements ranging from 2-11\% on the ProofNet, miniF2F-test, and MUSTARD datasets without additional scaling. Furthermore, KG-Prover with o4-mini achieves over 50% miniF2F-test. This work provides a promising approach for augmenting natural language proof reasoning with knowledge graphs without the need for additional finetuning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Integrating large language models (LLMs) into autonomous driving motion planning has recently emerged as a promising direction, offering enhanced interpretability, better controllability, and improved generalization in rare and long-tail scenarios. However, existing methods often rely on abstracted perception or map-based inputs, missing crucial visual context, such as fine-grained road cues, accident aftermath, or unexpected obstacles, which are essential for robust decision-making in complex driving environments. To bridge this gap, we propose VLMPlanner, a hybrid framework that combines a learning-based real-time planner with a vision-language model (VLM) capable of reasoning over raw images. The VLM processes multi-view images to capture rich, detailed visual information and leverages its common-sense reasoning capabilities to guide the real-time planner in generating robust and safe trajectories. Furthermore, we develop the Context-Adaptive Inference Gate (CAI-Gate) mechanism that enables the VLM to mimic human driving behavior by dynamically adjusting its inference frequency based on scene complexity, thereby achieving an optimal balance between planning performance and computational efficiency. We evaluate our approach on the large-scale, challenging nuPlan benchmark, with comprehensive experimental results demonstrating superior planning performance in scenarios with intricate road conditions and dynamic elements. Code will be available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems but often struggle with long, conditional workflows that involve external tool calls and depend on user-specific information. We present Workflow Adherence via Runtime Parallel Personalization, or WARPP, a training-free, modular framework that combines multi-agent orchestration with runtime personalization to improve workflow adherence in LLM-based systems. By dynamically pruning conditional branches based on user attributes, the framework reduces reasoning overhead and narrows tool selection at runtime. WARPP deploys a parallelized architecture where a dedicated Personalizer agent operates alongside modular, domain-specific agents to dynamically tailor execution paths in real time. The framework is evaluated across five representative user intents of varying complexity within three domains: banking, flights, and healthcare. Our evaluation leverages synthetic datasets and LLM-powered simulated users to test scenarios with conditional dependencies. Our results demonstrate that WARPP outperforms both the non-personalized method and the ReAct baseline, achieving increasingly larger gains in parameter fidelity and tool accuracy as intent complexity grows, while also reducing average token usage, without any additional training.

  Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts.

  To fully expedite AI-powered chemical research, high-quality chemical databases are the cornerstone. Automatic extraction of chemical information from the literature is essential for constructing reaction databases, but it is currently limited by the multimodality and style variability of chemical information. In this work, we developed a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based multi-agent system for automatic chemical information extraction. We used the MLLM's strong reasoning capability to understand the structure of complex chemical graphics, decompose the extraction task into sub-tasks and coordinate a set of specialized agents to solve them. Our system achieved an F1 score of 80.8% on a benchmark dataset of complex chemical reaction graphics from the literature, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model (F1 score: 35.6%) by a significant margin. Additionally, it demonstrated consistent improvements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction image parsing, named entity recognition and text-based reaction extraction. This work is a critical step toward automated chemical information extraction into structured datasets, which will be a strong promoter of AI-driven chemical research.

  Slide animations, such as fade-in, fly-in, and wipe, are critical for audience engagement, efficient information delivery, and vivid visual expression. However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos, collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually created test set of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based dynamic slide generation.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of large language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs). However, it often produces brittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious reasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the trustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified theoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics. This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the stability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show that policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common occurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This theoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly disparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards that may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action degeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting to the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how stability is governed by an "effective reward" aggregation mechanism. We also prove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of increased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for recent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following trade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through perturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances policy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled theory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI systems.

  Inference-time alignment enables large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs aligned with end-user preferences without further training. Recent post-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify token generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward function KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A critical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward model, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially unstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that integrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation, eliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based guidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM fine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward model dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference distribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the preference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks, including mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating its effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.

  We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive, safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety `aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of $46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism, enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$, other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100% of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English, suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable navigation across linguistic contexts.

  This paper presents the development of an AI powered software platform that leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to transform technology scouting and solution discovery in industrial R&D. Traditional approaches to solving complex research and development challenges are often time consuming, manually driven, and heavily dependent on domain specific expertise. These methods typically involve navigating fragmented sources such as patent repositories, commercial product catalogs, and competitor data, leading to inefficiencies and incomplete insights. The proposed platform utilizes cutting edge LLM capabilities including semantic understanding, contextual reasoning, and cross-domain knowledge extraction to interpret problem statements and retrieve high-quality, sustainable solutions. The system processes unstructured patent texts, such as claims and technical descriptions, and systematically extracts potential innovations aligned with the given problem context. These solutions are then algorithmically organized under standardized technical categories and subcategories to ensure clarity and relevance across interdisciplinary domains. In addition to patent analysis, the platform integrates commercial intelligence by identifying validated market solutions and active organizations addressing similar challenges. This combined insight sourced from both intellectual property and real world product data enables R&D teams to assess not only technical novelty but also feasibility, scalability, and sustainability. The result is a comprehensive, AI driven scouting engine that reduces manual effort, accelerates innovation cycles, and enhances decision making in complex R&D environments.

  Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful paradigm for non-monotonic reasoning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in logical reasoning. Despite this potential, current evaluations of LLM capabilities in ASP are often limited. Existing works normally employ overly simplified ASP programs, do not support negation, disjunction, or multiple answer sets. Furthermore, there is a lack of benchmarks that introduce tasks specifically designed for ASP solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce ASPBench, a comprehensive ASP benchmark, including three ASP specific tasks: ASP entailment, answer set verification, and answer set computation. Our extensive evaluations on ASPBench reveal that while 14 state-of-the-art LLMs, including \emph{deepseek-r1}, \emph{o4-mini}, and \emph{gemini-2.5-flash-thinking}, perform relatively well on the first two simpler tasks, they struggle with answer set computation, which is the core of ASP solving. These findings offer insights into the current limitations of LLMs in ASP solving. This highlights the need for new approaches that integrate symbolic reasoning capabilities more effectively.

  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the theoretical foundations of learning from CoT data remain underdeveloped, and existing approaches -- such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) -- often fail on complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we identify core obstacles that hinder effective CoT learning, including distribution drift, lack of embedded search, and exponential inference costs. We introduce the Diligent Learner, a new learning paradigm that explicitly models reasoning as a depth-first search guided by a validator and supports backtracking upon failure. Under two mild and realistic assumptions, we prove that the Diligent Learner can efficiently learn from CoT data while existing methods fail to do so. This framework offers a path toward building scalable and reliable reasoning systems trained on naturally occurring, incomplete data -- paving the way for the development of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with robust, interpretable problem-solving abilities.

  Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their reasoning capabilities through feedback. A critical challenge is verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference answers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced. Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based verifiers. However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM judges can be inconsistent. Existing research primarily focuses on building better verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers' performance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). To address this, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating verifiers. We construct 4,000 expert-level questions covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Each question is equipped with reference answers and diverse responses. The reliability of the evaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a multidisciplinary expert team. We design a four-dimensional experimental framework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized verifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs. complete responses, and short vs. long outputs. Our evaluation uncovers fundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve leading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show stronger inclusivity but unstable precision. More importantly, we discover verifiers' high sensitivity to input structure and inherent limitations in cross-domain generalization, providing critical insights into the bottlenecks of current verifier technology.

  Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in social deduction games (SDGs) like Werewolf, where strategic reasoning and social deception are essential. However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.
