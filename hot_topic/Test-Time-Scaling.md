- **[Air-Ground Collaboration for Language-Specified Missions in Unknown Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09108)**  `arXiv:2505.09108`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  As autonomous robotic systems become increasingly mature, users will want to specify missions at the level of intent rather than in low-level detail. Language is an expressive and intuitive medium for such mission specification. However, realizing language-guided robotic teams requires overcoming significant technical hurdles. Interpreting and realizing language-specified missions requires advanced semantic reasoning. Successful heterogeneous robots must effectively coordinate actions and share information across varying viewpoints. Additionally, communication between robots is typically intermittent, necessitating robust strategies that leverage communication opportunities to maintain coordination and achieve mission objectives. In this work, we present a first-of-its-kind system where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) are able to collaboratively accomplish missions specified in natural language while reacting to changes in specification on the fly. We leverage a Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled planner to reason over semantic-metric maps that are built online and opportunistically shared between an aerial and a ground robot. We consider task-driven navigation in urban and rural areas. Our system must infer mission-relevant semantics and actively acquire information via semantic mapping. In both ground and air-ground teaming experiments, we demonstrate our system on seven different natural-language specifications at up to kilometer-scale navigation.

- **[SafePath: Conformal Prediction for Safe LLM-Based Autonomous Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09427)**  `arXiv:2505.09427`  `cs.LG` `cs.RO`

  Large Language Models (LLMs) show growing promise in autonomous driving by reasoning over complex traffic scenarios to generate path plans. However, their tendencies toward overconfidence, and hallucinations raise critical safety concerns. We introduce SafePath, a modular framework that augments LLM-based path planning with formal safety guarantees using conformal prediction. SafePath operates in three stages. In the first stage, we use an LLM that generates a set of diverse candidate paths, exploring possible trajectories based on agent behaviors and environmental cues. In the second stage, SafePath filters out high-risk trajectories while guaranteeing that at least one safe option is included with a user-defined probability, through a multiple-choice question-answering formulation that integrates conformal prediction. In the final stage, our approach selects the path with the lowest expected collision risk when uncertainty is low or delegates control to a human when uncertainty is high. We theoretically prove that SafePath guarantees a safe trajectory with a user-defined probability, and we show how its human delegation rate can be tuned to balance autonomy and safety. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Highway-env show that SafePath reduces planning uncertainty by 77\% and collision rates by up to 70\%, demonstrating effectiveness in making LLM-driven path planning more safer.

  Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) constitutes a transformative technological wave that reconfigures industries through its unparalleled capabilities for content creation, reasoning, planning, and multimodal understanding. This revolutionary force offers the most promising path yet toward solving one of engineering's grandest challenges: achieving reliable, fully autonomous driving, particularly the pursuit of Level 5 autonomy. This survey delivers a comprehensive and critical synthesis of the emerging role of GenAI across the autonomous driving stack. We begin by distilling the principles and trade-offs of modern generative modeling, encompassing VAEs, GANs, Diffusion Models, and Large Language Models (LLMs). We then map their frontier applications in image, LiDAR, trajectory, occupancy, video generation as well as LLM-guided reasoning and decision making. We categorize practical applications, such as synthetic data workflows, end-to-end driving strategies, high-fidelity digital twin systems, smart transportation networks, and cross-domain transfer to embodied AI. We identify key obstacles and possibilities such as comprehensive generalization across rare cases, evaluation and safety checks, budget-limited implementation, regulatory compliance, ethical concerns, and environmental effects, while proposing research plans across theoretical assurances, trust metrics, transport integration, and socio-technical influence. By unifying these threads, the survey provides a forward-looking reference for researchers, engineers, and policymakers navigating the convergence of generative AI and advanced autonomous mobility.

- **[Towards Autonomous UAV Visual Object Search in City Space: Benchmark and Agentic Methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08765)**  `arXiv:2505.08765`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yatai Ji, Zhengqiu Zhu, Yong Zhao, Beidan Liu, Chen Gao, Yihao Zhao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aerial Visual Object Search (AVOS) tasks in urban environments require Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to autonomously search for and identify target objects using visual and textual cues without external guidance. Existing approaches struggle in complex urban environments due to redundant semantic processing, similar object distinction, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To bridge this gap and support the AVOS task, we introduce CityAVOS, the first benchmark dataset for autonomous search of common urban objects. This dataset comprises 2,420 tasks across six object categories with varying difficulty levels, enabling comprehensive evaluation of UAV agents' search capabilities. To solve the AVOS tasks, we also propose PRPSearcher (Perception-Reasoning-Planning Searcher), a novel agentic method powered by multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that mimics human three-tier cognition. Specifically, PRPSearcher constructs three specialized maps: an object-centric dynamic semantic map enhancing spatial perception, a 3D cognitive map based on semantic attraction values for target reasoning, and a 3D uncertainty map for balanced exploration-exploitation search. Also, our approach incorporates a denoising mechanism to mitigate interference from similar objects and utilizes an Inspiration Promote Thought (IPT) prompting mechanism for adaptive action planning. Experimental results on CityAVOS demonstrate that PRPSearcher surpasses existing baselines in both success rate and search efficiency (on average: +37.69% SR, +28.96% SPL, -30.69% MSS, and -46.40% NE). While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights the need for better semantic reasoning and spatial exploration capabilities in AVOS tasks. This work establishes a foundation for future advances in embodied target search. Dataset and source code are available atthis https URL.

- **[FaceShield: Explainable Face Anti-Spoofing with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09415)**  `arXiv:2505.09415`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hongyang Wang, Yichen Shi, Zhuofu Tao, Yuhao Gao, Liepiao Zhang, Xun Lin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for protecting facial recognition systems from presentation attacks. Previous methods approached this task as a classification problem, lacking interpretability and reasoning behind the predicted results. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and decision-making in visual tasks. However, there is currently no universal and comprehensive MLLM and dataset specifically designed for FAS task. To address this gap, we propose FaceShield, a MLLM for FAS, along with the corresponding pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, FaceShield-pre10K and FaceShield-sft45K. FaceShield is capable of determining the authenticity of faces, identifying types of spoofing attacks, providing reasoning for its judgments, and detecting attack areas. Specifically, we employ spoof-aware vision perception (SAVP) that incorporates both the original image and auxiliary information based on prior knowledge. We then use an prompt-guided vision token masking (PVTM) strategy to random mask vision tokens, thereby improving the model's generalization ability. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating that FaceShield significantly outperforms previous deep learning models and general MLLMs on four FAS tasks, i.e., coarse-grained classification, fine-grained classification, reasoning, and attack localization. Our instruction datasets, protocols, and codes will be released soon.

- **[Seeing Beyond the Scene: Enhancing Vision-Language Models with Interactional Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09118)**  `arXiv:2505.09118`  `cs.CV`  
  _Dayong Liang, Changmeng Zheng, Zhiyuan Wen, Yi Cai, Xiao-Yong Wei, Qing Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional scene graphs primarily focus on spatial relationships, limiting vision-language models' (VLMs) ability to reason about complex interactions in visual scenes. This paper addresses two key challenges: (1) conventional detection-to-construction methods produce unfocused, contextually irrelevant relationship sets, and (2) existing approaches fail to form persistent memories for generalizing interaction reasoning to new scenes. We propose Interaction-augmented Scene Graph Reasoning (ISGR), a framework that enhances VLMs' interactional reasoning through three complementary components. First, our dual-stream graph constructor combines SAM-powered spatial relation extraction with interaction-aware captioning to generate functionally salient scene graphs with spatial grounding. Second, we employ targeted interaction queries to activate VLMs' latent knowledge of object functionalities, converting passive recognition into active reasoning about how objects work together. Finally, we introduce a lone-term memory reinforcement learning strategy with a specialized interaction-focused reward function that transforms transient patterns into long-term reasoning heuristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods on interaction-heavy reasoning benchmarks, with particularly strong improvements on complex scene understanding tasks.

- **[Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models on Fine-Grained Image Tasks: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14988)**  `arXiv:2504.14988`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hong-Tao Yu, Xiu-Shen Wei, Yuxin Peng, Serge Belongie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal perception capabilities, garnering significant attention. While numerous evaluation studies have emerged, assessing LVLMs both holistically and on specialized tasks, fine-grained image tasks-fundamental to computer vision-remain largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce a comprehensive fine-grained evaluation benchmark, i.e., FG-BMK, comprising 1.01 million questions and 0.33 million images. Our evaluation systematically examines LVLMs from both human-oriented and machine-oriented perspectives, focusing on their semantic recognition and fine-grained feature representation capabilities. Through extensive experiments on twelve representative LVLMs/VLMs, we uncover key findings regarding the influence of training paradigms, modality alignment, perturbation susceptibility, and fine-grained category reasoning on task performance. This work provides critical insights into the limitations of current LVLMs and offers guidance for future data construction and model design in the development of more advanced LVLMs. Our code is open-source and available atthis https URL.

  _Kaituo Feng, Kaixiong Gong, Bohao Li, Zonghao Guo, Yibing Wang, Tianshuo Peng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success in eliciting reasoning abilities through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce Video-R1 as the first attempt to systematically explore the R1 paradigm for incentivizing video reasoning within multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, directly applying RL training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-CoT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 37.1% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in deep thinking models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their effectiveness in embodied domains which require continuous interaction with environments through image action interleaved trajectories remains largely -unexplored. We present Embodied Reasoner, a model that extends o1 style reasoning to interactive embodied search tasks. Unlike mathematical reasoning that relies primarily on logical deduction, embodied scenarios demand spatial understanding, temporal reasoning, and ongoing self-reflection based on interaction history. To address these challenges, we synthesize 9.3k coherent Observation-Thought-Action trajectories containing 64k interactive images and 90k diverse thinking processes (analysis, spatial reasoning, reflection, planning, and verification). We develop a three-stage training pipeline that progressively enhances the model's capabilities through imitation learning, self-exploration via rejection sampling, and self-correction through reflection tuning. The evaluation shows that our model significantly outperforms those advanced visual reasoning models, e.g., it exceeds OpenAI o1, o3-mini, and Claude-3.7 by +9\%, 24\%, and +13\%. Analysis reveals our model exhibits fewer repeated searches and logical inconsistencies, with particular advantages in complex long-horizon tasks. Real-world environments also show our superiority while exhibiting fewer repeated searches and logical inconsistency cases.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce the Llama-Nemotron series of models, an open family of heterogeneous reasoning models that deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities, inference efficiency, and an open license for enterprise use. The family comes in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report, we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models -- LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset: Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.

- **[Fusing Bidirectional Chains of Thought and Reward Mechanisms A Method for Enhancing Question-Answering Capabilities of Large Language Models for Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08167)**  `arXiv:2505.08167`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Ruilin Liu, Zhixiao Zhao, Jieqiong Li, Chang Liu, Dongbo Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has provided significant support and opportunities for the advancement of domain-specific LLMs. However, fine-tuning these large models using Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) data inevitably faces challenges such as bias, incorrect knowledge inheritance, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose a novel training method that integrates a bidirectional chains of thought and a reward mechanism. This method is built upon ICH-Qwen, a large language model specifically designed for the field of intangible cultural heritage. The proposed method enables the model to not only perform forward reasoning but also enhances the accuracy of the generated answers by utilizing reverse questioning and reverse reasoning to activate the model's latent knowledge. Additionally, a reward mechanism is introduced during training to optimize the decision-making process. This mechanism improves the quality of the model's outputs through structural and content evaluations with different weighting schemes. We conduct comparative experiments on ICH-Qwen, with results demonstrating that our method outperforms 0-shot, step-by-step reasoning, knowledge distillation, and question augmentation methods in terms of accuracy, Bleu-4, and Rouge-L scores on the question-answering task. Furthermore, the paper highlights the effectiveness of combining the bidirectional chains of thought and reward mechanism through ablation experiments. In addition, a series of generalizability experiments are conducted, with results showing that the proposed method yields improvements on various domain-specific datasets and advanced models in areas such as Finance, Wikidata, and StrategyQA. This demonstrates that the method is adaptable to multiple domains and provides a valuable approach for model training in future applications across diverse fields.

- **[FAMMA: A Benchmark for Financial Domain Multilingual Multimodal Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04526)**  `arXiv:2410.04526`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Siqiao Xue, Xiaojing Li, Fan Zhou, Qingyang Dai, Zhixuan Chu, Hongyuan Mei_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce FAMMA, an open-source benchmark for \underline{f}in\underline{a}ncial \underline{m}ultilingual \underline{m}ultimodal question \underline{a}nswering (QA). Our benchmark aims to evaluate the abilities of large language models (LLMs) in answering complex reasoning questions that require advanced financial knowledge. The benchmark has two versions: FAMMA-Basic consists of 1,945 questions extracted from university textbooks and exams, along with human-annotated answers and rationales; FAMMA-LivePro consists of 103 novel questions created by human domain experts, with answers and rationales held out from the public for a contamination-free evaluation. These questions cover advanced knowledge of 8 major subfields in finance (e.g., corporate finance, derivatives, and portfolio management). Some are in Chinese or French, while a majority of them are in English. Each question has some non-text data such as charts, diagrams, or tables. Our experiments reveal that FAMMA poses a significant challenge on LLMs, including reasoning models such as GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Additionally, we curated 1,270 reasoning trajectories of DeepSeek-R1 on the FAMMA-Basic data, and fine-tuned a series of open-source Qwen models using this reasoning data. We found that training a model on these reasoning trajectories can significantly improve its performance on FAMMA-LivePro. We released our leaderboard, data, code, and trained models atthis https URL.

- **[Qwen3 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388)**  `arXiv:2505.09388`  `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we present Qwen3, the latest version of the Qwen model family. Qwen3 comprises a series of large language models (LLMs) designed to advance performance, efficiency, and multilingual capabilities. The Qwen3 series includes models of both dense and Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architectures, with parameter scales ranging from 0.6 to 235 billion. A key innovation in Qwen3 is the integration of thinking mode (for complex, multi-step reasoning) and non-thinking mode (for rapid, context-driven responses) into a unified framework. This eliminates the need to switch between different models--such as chat-optimized models (e.g., GPT-4o) and dedicated reasoning models (e.g., QwQ-32B)--and enables dynamic mode switching based on user queries or chat templates. Meanwhile, Qwen3 introduces a thinking budget mechanism, allowing users to allocate computational resources adaptively during inference, thereby balancing latency and performance based on task complexity. Moreover, by leveraging the knowledge from the flagship models, we significantly reduce the computational resources required to build smaller-scale models, while ensuring their highly competitive performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Qwen3 achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks, including tasks in code generation, mathematical reasoning, agent tasks, etc., competitive against larger MoE models and proprietary models. Compared to its predecessor Qwen2.5, Qwen3 expands multilingual support from 29 to 119 languages and dialects, enhancing global accessibility through improved cross-lingual understanding and generation capabilities. To facilitate reproducibility and community-driven research and development, all Qwen3 models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

- **[A suite of LMs comprehend puzzle statements as well as humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08996)**  `arXiv:2505.08996`  `cs.CL`  
  _Adele E Goldberg, Supantho Rakshit, Jennifer Hu, Kyle Mahowald_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent claims suggest that large language models (LMs) underperform humans in comprehending minimally complex English statements (Dentella et al., 2024). Here, we revisit those findings and argue that human performance was overestimated, while LLM abilities were underestimated. Using the same stimuli, we report a preregistered study comparing human responses in two conditions: one allowed rereading (replicating the original study), and one that restricted rereading (a more naturalistic comprehension test). Human accuracy dropped significantly when rereading was restricted (73%), falling below that of Falcon-180B-Chat (76%) and GPT-4 (81%). The newer GPT-o1 model achieves perfect accuracy. Results further show that both humans and models are disproportionately challenged by queries involving potentially reciprocal actions (e.g., kissing), suggesting shared pragmatic sensitivities rather than model-specific deficits. Additional analyses using Llama-2-70B log probabilities, a recoding of open-ended model responses, and grammaticality ratings of other sentences reveal systematic underestimation of model performance. We find that GPT-4o can align with either naive or expert grammaticality judgments, depending on prompt framing. These findings underscore the need for more careful experimental design and coding practices in LLM evaluation, and they challenge the assumption that current models are inherently weaker than humans at language comprehension.

- **[Is analogy enough to draw novel adjective-noun inferences?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24293)**  `arXiv:2503.24293`  `cs.CL`  
  _Hayley Ross, Kathryn Davidson, Najoung Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent work (Ross et al., 2025, 2024) has argued that the ability of humans and LLMs respectively to generalize to novel adjective-noun combinations shows that they each have access to a compositional mechanism to determine the phrase's meaning and derive inferences. We study whether these inferences can instead be derived by analogy to known inferences, without need for composition. We investigate this by (1) building a model of analogical reasoning using similarity over lexical items, and (2) asking human participants to reason by analogy. While we find that this strategy works well for a large proportion of the dataset of Ross et al. (2025), there are novel combinations for which both humans and LLMs derive convergent inferences but which are not well handled by analogy. We thus conclude that the mechanism humans and LLMs use to generalize in these cases cannot be fully reduced to analogy, and likely involves composition.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) showcase varied multilingual capabilities across tasks like translation, code generation, and reasoning. Previous assessments often limited their scope to fundamental natural language processing (NLP) or isolated capability-specific tasks. To alleviate this drawback, we aim to present a comprehensive multilingual multitask benchmark. First, we introduce P-MMEval, a large-scale benchmark covering effective fundamental and capability-specialized datasets. Furthermore, P-MMEval delivers consistent language coverage across various datasets and provides parallel samples. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on representative multilingual model series to compare performances across models and tasks, explore the relationship between multilingual performances and factors such as tasks, model sizes, languages, and prompts, and examine the effectiveness of knowledge transfer from English to other languages. The resulting insights are intended to offer valuable guidance for future research. The dataset is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has shifted artificial intelligence (AI) research toward agentic systems, motivating the use of weaker and more flexible notions of agency. However, this shift raises key questions about the extent to which LLM-based agents replicate human strategic reasoning, particularly in game-theoretic settings. In this context, we examine the role of agentic sophistication in shaping artificial reasoners' performance by evaluating three agent designs: a simple game-theoretic model, an unstructured LLM-as-agent model, and an LLM integrated into a traditional agentic framework. Using guessing games as a testbed, we benchmarked these agents against human participants across general reasoning patterns and individual role-based objectives. Furthermore, we introduced obfuscated game scenarios to assess agents' ability to generalise beyond training distributions. Our analysis, covering over 2000 reasoning samples across 25 agent configurations, shows that human-inspired cognitive structures can enhance LLM agents' alignment with human strategic behaviour. Still, the relationship between agentic design complexity and human-likeness is non-linear, highlighting a critical dependence on underlying LLM capabilities and suggesting limits to simple architectural augmentation.

  _Adarsh Kumar, Hwiyoon Kim, Jawahar Sai Nathani, Neil Roy_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucination, where large language models (LLMs) generate confident but incorrect or irrelevant information, remains a key limitation in their application to complex, open-ended tasks. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a promising method for improving multistep reasoning by guiding models through intermediate steps. However, CoT alone does not fully address the hallucination problem. In this work, we investigate how combining CoT with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), as well as applying self-consistency and self-verification strategies, can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. By incorporating external knowledge sources during reasoning and enabling models to verify or revise their own outputs, we aim to generate more accurate and coherent responses. We present a comparative evaluation of baseline LLMs against CoT, CoT+RAG, self-consistency, and self-verification techniques. Our results highlight the effectiveness of each method and identify the most robust approach for minimizing hallucinations while preserving fluency and reasoning depth.

  _Xinji Mai, Haotian Xu, Xing W, Weinong Wang, Yingying Zhang, Wenqiang Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks requiring precise, verifiable computation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.

- **[UI-R1: Enhancing Efficient Action Prediction of GUI Agents by Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21620)**  `arXiv:2503.21620`  `cs.AI`  
  _Zhengxi Lu, Yuxiang Chai, Yaxuan Guo, Xi Yin, Liang Liu, Hao Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent DeepSeek-R1 has showcased the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards. Despite its success in language models, its application in multi-modal domains, particularly in graphic user interface (GUI) agent tasks, remains under-explored. To address this issue, we propose UI-R1, the first framework to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI action prediction tasks. Specifically, UI-R1 introduces a novel rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). For efficient training, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed UI-R1-3B achieves significant improvements over the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks, with average accuracy gains of 22.1% on ScreenSpot, 6.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, and 12.7% on ANDROIDCONTROL. Furthermore, UI-R1-3B delivers competitive performance compared to larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B) trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K samples. We additionally develop an optimized version, UI-R1-E-3B, which significantly improves both grounding efficiency and accuracy. These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain. Code website:this https URL.
