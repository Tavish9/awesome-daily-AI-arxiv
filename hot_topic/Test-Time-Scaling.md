- **[Reasoning Under 1 Billion: Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02273)**  `arXiv:2504.02273`  `cs.LG`  
  _Hung Le, Dai Do, Dung Nguyen, Svetha Venkatesh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) have shown promising improvements in complex reasoning tasks, particularly when paired with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. However, these successes have been largely demonstrated on large-scale models with billions of parameters, where a strong pretraining foundation ensures effective initial exploration. In contrast, RL remains challenging for tiny LLMs with 1 billion parameters or fewer because they lack the necessary pretraining strength to explore effectively, often leading to suboptimal reasoning patterns. This work introduces a novel intrinsic motivation approach that leverages episodic memory to address this challenge, improving tiny LLMs in CoT reasoning tasks. Inspired by human memory-driven learning, our method leverages successful reasoning patterns stored in memory while allowing for controlled exploration to generate novel responses. Intrinsic rewards are computed efficiently using a kNN-based episodic memory, allowing the model to discover new reasoning strategies while quickly adapting to effective past solutions. Experiments on fine-tuning GSM8K and AI-MO datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances smaller LLMs' sample efficiency and generalization capability, making RL-based reasoning improvements more accessible in low-resource settings.

- **[When Reasoning Meets Compression: Benchmarking Compressed Large Reasoning Models on Complex Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02010)**  `arXiv:2504.02010`  `cs.LG`

  Recent open-source large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, but their large parameter count makes them prohibitively expensive for individuals. The compression of large language models (LLMs) offers an effective solution to reduce cost of computational resources. However, systematic studies on the performance of compressed LLMs in complex reasoning tasks, especially for LRMs, are lacking. Most works on quantization and pruning focus on preserving language modeling performance, while existing distillation works do not comprehensively benchmark student models based on reasoning difficulty or compression impact on knowledge and reasoning. In this paper, we benchmark compressed DeepSeek-R1 models on four different reasoning datasets (AIME 2024, FOLIO, Temporal Sequences of BIG-Bench Hard, and MuSiQue), ranging from mathematical to multihop reasoning, using quantization, distillation, and pruning methods. We benchmark 2.51-, 1.73-, and 1.58-bit R1 models that adopt dynamic quantization. We also benchmark distilled R1 models that are based on LLaMA or Qwen and run SparseGPT on them to obtain various sparsity levels. Studying the performance and behavior of compressed LRMs, we report their performance scores and test-time compute (number of tokens spent on each question). Notably, using MuSiQue, we find that parameter count has a much greater impact on LRMs' knowledge memorization than on their reasoning capability, which can inform the choice of compression techniques. Through our empirical analysis of test-time compute, we find that shorter model outputs generally achieve better performance than longer ones across several benchmarks for both R1 and its compressed variants, highlighting the need for more concise reasoning chains.

- **[OmniTalker: Real-Time Text-Driven Talking Head Generation with In-Context Audio-Visual Style Replication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02433)**  `arXiv:2504.02433`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhongjian Wang, Peng Zhang, Jinwei Qi, Guangyuan Wang Sheng Xu, Bang Zhang, Liefeng Bo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in talking head generation, owing to its potential to revolutionize the human-AI interaction from text interfaces into realistic video chats. However, research on text-driven talking heads remains underexplored, with existing methods predominantly adopting a cascaded pipeline that combines TTS systems with audio-driven talking head models. This conventional pipeline not only introduces system complexity and latency overhead but also fundamentally suffers from asynchronous audiovisual output and stylistic discrepancies between generated speech and visual expressions. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniTalker, an end-to-end unified framework that simultaneously generates synchronized speech and talking head videos from text and reference video in real-time zero-shot scenarios, while preserving both speech style and facial styles. The framework employs a dual-branch diffusion transformer architecture: the audio branch synthesizes mel-spectrograms from text, while the visual branch predicts fine-grained head poses and facial dynamics. To bridge modalities, we introduce a novel audio-visual fusion module that integrates cross-modal information to ensure temporal synchronization and stylistic coherence between audio and visual outputs. Furthermore, our in-context reference learning module effectively captures both speech and facial style characteristics from a single reference video without introducing an extra style extracting module. To the best of our knowledge, OmniTalker presents the first unified framework that jointly models speech style and facial style in a zero-shot setting, achieving real-time inference speed of 25 FPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in generation quality, particularly excelling in style preservation and audio-video synchronization.

- **[Generative Evaluation of Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02810)**  `arXiv:2504.02810`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  With powerful large language models (LLMs) demonstrating superhuman reasoning capabilities, a critical question arises: Do LLMs genuinely reason, or do they merely recall answers from their extensive, web-scraped training datasets? Publicly released benchmarks inevitably become contaminated once incorporated into subsequent LLM training sets, undermining their reliability as faithful assessments. To address this, we introduce KUMO, a generative evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing reasoning in LLMs. KUMO synergistically combines LLMs with symbolic engines to dynamically produce diverse, multi-turn reasoning tasks that are partially observable and adjustable in difficulty. Through an automated pipeline, KUMO continuously generates novel tasks across open-ended domains, compelling models to demonstrate genuine generalization rather than memorization. We evaluated 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on 5,000 tasks across 100 domains created by KUMO, benchmarking their reasoning abilities against university students. Our findings reveal that many LLMs have outperformed university-level performance on easy reasoning tasks, and reasoning-scaled LLMs reach university-level performance on complex reasoning challenges. Moreover, LLM performance on KUMO tasks correlates strongly with results on newly released real-world reasoning benchmarks, underscoring KUMO's value as a robust, enduring assessment tool for genuine LLM reasoning capabilities.

- **[ERPO: Advancing Safety Alignment via Ex-Ante Reasoning Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02725)**  `arXiv:2504.02725`  `cs.CL`  
  _Kehua Feng, Keyan Ding, Jing Yu, Menghan Li, Yuhao Wang, Tong Xu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress toward artificial general intelligence, yet their potential to generate harmful content poses critical safety challenges. Existing alignment methods often struggle to cover diverse safety scenarios and remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose Ex-Ante Reasoning Preference Optimization (ERPO), a novel safety alignment framework that equips LLMs with explicit preemptive reasoning through Chain-of-Thought and provides clear evidence for safety judgments by embedding predefined safety rules. Specifically, our approach consists of three stages: first, equipping the model with Ex-Ante reasoning through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using a constructed reasoning module; second, enhancing safety, usefulness, and efficiency via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO); and third, mitigating inference latency with a length-controlled iterative preference optimization strategy. Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs demonstrate that ERPO significantly enhances safety performance while maintaining response efficiency.

- **[LLM for Complex Reasoning Task: An Exploratory Study in Fermi Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02671)**  `arXiv:2504.02671`  `cs.CL`

  Fermi Problems (FPs) are mathematical reasoning tasks that require human-like logic and numerical reasoning. Unlike other reasoning questions, FPs often involve real-world impracticalities or ambiguous concepts, making them challenging even for humans to solve. Despite advancements in AI, particularly with large language models (LLMs) in various reasoning tasks, FPs remain relatively under-explored. This work conducted an exploratory study to examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in solving FPs. We first evaluated the overall performance of three advanced LLMs using a publicly available FP dataset. We designed prompts according to the recently proposed TELeR taxonomy, including a zero-shot scenario. Results indicated that all three LLMs achieved a fp_score (range between 0 - 1) below 0.5, underscoring the inherent difficulty of these reasoning tasks. To further investigate, we categorized FPs into standard and specific questions, hypothesizing that LLMs would perform better on standard questions, which are characterized by clarity and conciseness, than on specific ones. Comparative experiments confirmed this hypothesis, demonstrating that LLMs performed better on standard FPs in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

- **[LexPam: Legal Procedure Awareness-Guided Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02590)**  `arXiv:2504.02590`  `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The legal mathematical reasoning ability of LLMs is crucial when applying them to real-world scenarios, as it directly affects the credibility of the LLM. While existing legal LLMs can perform general judicial question answering, their legal mathematical reasoning capabilities have not been trained. Open-domain reasoning models, though able to generate detailed calculation steps, do not follow the reasoning logic required for legal scenarios. Additionally, there is currently a lack of legal mathematical reasoning datasets to help validate and enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities in legal contexts. To address these issues, we propose the first Chinese legal Mathematical Reasoning Dataset, LexNum, which includes three common legal mathematical reasoning scenarios: economic compensation, work injury compensation, and traffic accident compensation. Based on LexNum, we tested the performance of existing legal LLMs and reasoning LLMs, and introduced LexPam, a reinforcement learning algorithm guided by legal procedural awareness to train LLMs, enhancing their mathematical reasoning abilities in legal scenarios. Experiments on tasks in the three legal scenarios show that the performance of existing legal LLMs and reasoning models in legal mathematical reasoning tasks is unsatisfactory. LexPam can enhance the LLM's ability in these tasks.

  _Xiang Feng, Wentao Jiang, Zengmao Wang, Yong Luo, Pingbo Xu, Baosheng Yu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The application of large language models (LLMs) in the medical field has gained significant attention, yet their reasoning capabilities in more specialized domains like anesthesiology remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in anesthesiology and analyze key factors influencing their performance. To this end, we introduce AnesBench, a cross-lingual benchmark designed to assess anesthesiology-related reasoning across three levels: factual retrieval (System 1), hybrid reasoning (System 1.x), and complex decision-making (System 2). Through extensive experiments, we first explore how model characteristics, including model scale, Chain of Thought (CoT) length, and language transferability, affect reasoning performance. Then, we further evaluate the effectiveness of different training strategies, leveraging our curated anesthesiology-related dataset, including continuous pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Additionally, we also investigate how the test-time reasoning techniques, such as Best-of-N sampling and beam search, influence reasoning performance, and assess the impact of reasoning-enhanced model distillation, specifically DeepSeek-R1. We will publicly release AnesBench, along with our CPT and SFT training datasets and evaluation code atthis https URL.

- **[LearNAT: Learning NL2SQL with AST-guided Task Decomposition for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02327)**  `arXiv:2504.02327`  `cs.CL`  
  _Weibin Liao, Xin Gao, Tianyu Jia, Rihong Qiu, Yifan Zhu, Yang Lin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) has emerged as a critical task for enabling seamless interaction with databases. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in this domain. However, existing NL2SQL methods predominantly rely on closed-source LLMs leveraging prompt engineering, while open-source models typically require fine-tuning to acquire domain-specific knowledge. Despite these efforts, open-source LLMs struggle with complex NL2SQL tasks due to the indirect expression of user query objectives and the semantic gap between user queries and database schemas. Inspired by the application of reinforcement learning in mathematical problem-solving to encourage step-by-step reasoning in LLMs, we propose LearNAT (Learning NL2SQL with AST-guided Task Decomposition), a novel framework that improves the performance of open-source LLMs on complex NL2SQL tasks through task decomposition and reinforcement learning. LearNAT introduces three key components: (1) a Decomposition Synthesis Procedure that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to guide efficient search and pruning strategies for task decomposition, (2) Margin-aware Reinforcement Learning, which employs fine-grained step-level optimization via DPO with AST margins, and (3) Adaptive Demonstration Reasoning, a mechanism for dynamically selecting relevant examples to enhance decomposition capabilities. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, Spider and BIRD, demonstrate that LearNAT enables a 7B-parameter open-source LLM to achieve performance comparable to GPT-4, while offering improved efficiency and accessibility.

- **[CoTAL: Human-in-the-Loop Prompt Engineering, Chain-of-Thought Reasoning, and Active Learning for Generalizable Formative Assessment Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02323)**  `arXiv:2504.02323`  `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to assist teachers and support student learning. Methods such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enable LLMs to grade formative assessments in science, providing scores and relevant feedback to students. However, the extent to which these methods generalize across curricula in multiple domains (such as science, computing, and engineering) remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Thought Prompting + Active Learning (CoTAL), an LLM-based approach to formative assessment scoring that (1) leverages Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) principles to develop curriculum-aligned formative assessments and rubrics, (2) applies human-in-the-loop prompt engineering to automate response scoring, and (3) incorporates teacher and student feedback to iteratively refine assessment questions, grading rubrics, and LLM prompts for automated grading. Our findings demonstrate that CoTAL improves GPT-4's scoring performance, achieving gains of up to 24.5% over a non-prompt-engineered baseline. Both teachers and students view CoTAL as effective in scoring and explaining student responses, each providing valuable refinements to enhance grading accuracy and explanation quality.

- **[Exploring LLM Reasoning Through Controlled Prompt Variations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02111)**  `arXiv:2504.02111`  `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Giannis Chatziveroglou, Richard Yun, Maura Kelleher_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study investigates the reasoning robustness of large language models (LLMs) on mathematical problem-solving tasks under systematically introduced input perturbations. Using the GSM8K dataset as a controlled testbed, we evaluate how well state-of-the-art models maintain logical consistency and correctness when confronted with four categories of prompt perturbations: irrelevant context, pathological instructions, factually relevant but non-essential context, and a combination of the latter two. Our experiments, conducted on thirteen open-source and closed-source LLMs, reveal that introducing irrelevant context within the model's context window significantly degrades performance, suggesting that distinguishing essential from extraneous details remains a pressing challenge. Surprisingly, performance regressions are relatively insensitive to the complexity of the reasoning task, as measured by the number of steps required, and are not strictly correlated with model size. Moreover, we observe that certain perturbations inadvertently trigger chain-of-thought-like reasoning behaviors, even without explicit prompting. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in current LLMs and underscore the need for improved robustness against noisy, misleading, and contextually dense inputs, paving the way for more resilient and reliable reasoning in real-world applications.

- **[A Survey of Scaling in Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02181)**  `arXiv:2504.02181`  `cs.AI`  
  _Zihan Chen, Song Wang, Zhen Tan, Xingbo Fu, Zhenyu Lei, Peng Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancements in large Language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, driven by various strategies such as multi-agent collaboration. However, unlike the well-established performance improvements achieved through scaling data and model size, the scaling of reasoning in LLMs is more complex and can even negatively impact reasoning performance, introducing new challenges in model alignment and robustness. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive examination of scaling in LLM reasoning, categorizing it into multiple dimensions and analyzing how and to what extent different scaling strategies contribute to improving reasoning capabilities. We begin by exploring scaling in input size, which enables LLMs to process and utilize more extensive context for improved reasoning. Next, we analyze scaling in reasoning steps that improves multi-step inference and logical consistency. We then examine scaling in reasoning rounds, where iterative interactions refine reasoning outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss scaling in training-enabled reasoning, focusing on optimization through iterative model improvement. Finally, we review applications of scaling across domains and outline future directions for further advancing LLM reasoning. By synthesizing these diverse perspectives, this survey aims to provide insights into how scaling strategies fundamentally enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and further guide the development of next-generation AI systems.

  _Vignesh Prabhakar, Md Amirul Islam, Adam Atanas, Yao-Ting Wang, Joah Han, Aastha Jhunjhunwala, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in advancing scientific knowledge and addressing complex challenges. In this work, we introduce OmniScience, a specialized large reasoning model for general science, developed through three key components: (1) domain adaptive pretraining on a carefully curated corpus of scientific literature, (2) instruction tuning on a specialized dataset to guide the model in following domain-specific tasks, and (3) reasoning-based knowledge distillation through fine-tuning to significantly enhance its ability to generate contextually relevant and logically sound responses. We demonstrate the versatility of OmniScience by developing a battery agent that efficiently ranks molecules as potential electrolyte solvents or additives. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that OmniScience is competitive with state-of-the-art large reasoning models on the GPQA Diamond and domain-specific battery benchmarks, while outperforming all public reasoning and non-reasoning models with similar parameter counts. We further demonstrate via ablation experiments that domain adaptive pretraining and reasoning-based knowledge distillation are critical to attain our performance levels, across benchmarks.
