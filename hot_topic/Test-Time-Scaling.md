- **[Being-0: A Humanoid Robotic Agent with Vision-Language Models and Modular Skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12533)**  `arXiv:2503.12533`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  Building autonomous robotic agents capable of achieving human-level performance in real-world embodied tasks is an ultimate goal in humanoid robot research. Recent advances have made significant progress in high-level cognition with Foundation Models (FMs) and low-level skill development for humanoid robots. However, directly combining these components often results in poor robustness and efficiency due to compounding errors in long-horizon tasks and the varied latency of different modules. We introduce Being-0, a hierarchical agent framework that integrates an FM with a modular skill library. The FM handles high-level cognitive tasks such as instruction understanding, task planning, and reasoning, while the skill library provides stable locomotion and dexterous manipulation for low-level control. To bridge the gap between these levels, we propose a novel Connector module, powered by a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). The Connector enhances the FM's embodied capabilities by translating language-based plans into actionable skill commands and dynamically coordinating locomotion and manipulation to improve task success. With all components, except the FM, deployable on low-cost onboard computation devices, Being-0 achieves efficient, real-time performance on a full-sized humanoid robot equipped with dexterous hands and active vision. Extensive experiments in large indoor environments demonstrate Being-0's effectiveness in solving complex, long-horizon tasks that require challenging navigation and manipulation subtasks.

- **[Imagine, Verify, Execute: Memory-Guided Agentic Exploration with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07815)**  `arXiv:2505.07815`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  Exploration is essential for general-purpose robotic learning, especially in open-ended environments where dense rewards, explicit goals, or task-specific supervision are scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic reasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a compelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However, their outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute), an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration is often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to deepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes, predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop environments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful exploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the entropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports downstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the performance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations.

  Efficient path planning in robotics, particularly within large-scale, dynamic environments, remains a significant hurdle. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited adaptability in dynamic scenarios hinder real-time deployment on edge devices. We present SmallPlan -- a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like travel distance and number of trials. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics. Our source code is available here:this https URL

- **[HAMSTER: Hierarchical Action Models For Open-World Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05485)**  `arXiv:2502.05485`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is the lack of robotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot operation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as action-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we posit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more effective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that directly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level VLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The intermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates the high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the low-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with the hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant domain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing scenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances and task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average of 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of generalization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

- **[UAV-CodeAgents: Scalable UAV Mission Planning via Multi-Agent ReAct and Vision-Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07236)**  `arXiv:2505.07236`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Oleg Sautenkov, Yasheerah Yaqoot, Muhammad Ahsan Mustafa, Faryal Batool, Jeffrin Sam, Artem Lykov, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present UAV-CodeAgents, a scalable multi-agent framework for autonomous UAV mission generation, built on large language and vision-language models (LLMs/VLMs). The system leverages the ReAct (Reason + Act) paradigm to interpret satellite imagery, ground high-level natural language instructions, and collaboratively generate UAV trajectories with minimal human supervision. A core component is a vision-grounded, pixel-pointing mechanism that enables precise localization of semantic targets on aerial maps. To support real-time adaptability, we introduce a reactive thinking loop, allowing agents to iteratively reflect on observations, revise mission goals, and coordinate dynamically in evolving environments.UAV-CodeAgents is evaluated on large-scale mission scenarios involving industrial and environmental fire detection. Our results show that a lower decoding temperature (0.5) yields higher planning reliability and reduced execution time, with an average mission creation time of 96.96 seconds and a success rate of 93%. We further fine-tune Qwen2.5VL-7B on 9,000 annotated satellite images, achieving strong spatial grounding across diverse visual categories. To foster reproducibility and future research, we will release the full codebase and a novel benchmark dataset for vision-language-based UAV planning.

- **[UniDiffGrasp: A Unified Framework Integrating VLM Reasoning and VLM-Guided Part Diffusion for Open-Vocabulary Constrained Grasping with Dual Arms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06832)**  `arXiv:2505.06832`  `cs.RO`  
  _Xueyang Guo, Hongwei Hu, Chengye Song, Jiale Chen, Zilin Zhao, Yu Fu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-vocabulary, task-oriented grasping of specific functional parts, particularly with dual arms, remains a key challenge, as current Vision-Language Models (VLMs), while enhancing task understanding, often struggle with precise grasp generation within defined constraints and effective dual-arm coordination. We innovatively propose UniDiffGrasp, a unified framework integrating VLM reasoning with guided part diffusion to address these limitations. UniDiffGrasp leverages a VLM to interpret user input and identify semantic targets (object, part(s), mode), which are then grounded via open-vocabulary segmentation. Critically, the identified parts directly provide geometric constraints for a Constrained Grasp Diffusion Field (CGDF) using its Part-Guided Diffusion, enabling efficient, high-quality 6-DoF grasps without retraining. For dual-arm tasks, UniDiffGrasp defines distinct target regions, applies part-guided diffusion per arm, and selects stable cooperative grasps. Through extensive real-world deployment, UniDiffGrasp achieves grasp success rates of 0.876 in single-arm and 0.767 in dual-arm scenarios, significantly surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its capability to enable precise and coordinated open-vocabulary grasping in complex real-world scenarios.

- **[STRIVE: Structured Representation Integrating VLM Reasoning for Efficient Object Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06729)**  `arXiv:2505.06729`  `cs.RO`  
  _Haokun Zhu, Zongtai Li, Zhixuan Liu, Wenshan Wang, Ji Zhang, Jonathan Francis, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been increasingly integrated into object navigation tasks for their rich prior knowledge and strong reasoning abilities. However, applying VLMs to navigation poses two key challenges: effectively representing complex environment information and determining \textit{when and how} to query VLMs. Insufficient environment understanding and over-reliance on VLMs (e.g. querying at every step) can lead to unnecessary backtracking and reduced navigation efficiency, especially in continuous environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that constructs a multi-layer representation of the environment during navigation. This representation consists of viewpoint, object nodes, and room nodes. Viewpoints and object nodes facilitate intra-room exploration and accurate target localization, while room nodes support efficient inter-room planning. Building on this representation, we propose a novel two-stage navigation policy, integrating high-level planning guided by VLM reasoning with low-level VLM-assisted exploration to efficiently locate a goal object. We evaluated our approach on three simulated benchmarks (HM3D, RoboTHOR, and MP3D), and achieved state-of-the-art performance on both the success rate ($\mathord{\uparrow}\, 7.1\%$) and navigation efficiency ($\mathord{\uparrow}\, 12.5\%$). We further validate our method on a real robot platform, demonstrating strong robustness across 15 object navigation tasks in 10 different indoor environments.

- **[LLM-Flock: Decentralized Multi-Robot Flocking via Large Language Models and Influence-Based Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06513)**  `arXiv:2505.06513`  `cs.RO`  
  _Peihan Li, Lifeng Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, demonstrating strong capabilities in problem comprehension and reasoning. Inspired by these developments, researchers have begun exploring the use of LLMs as decentralized decision-makers for multi-robot formation control. However, prior studies reveal that directly applying LLMs to such tasks often leads to unstable and inconsistent behaviors, where robots may collapse to the centroid of their positions or diverge entirely due to hallucinated reasoning, logical inconsistencies, and limited coordination awareness. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that integrates LLMs with an influence-based plan consensus protocol. In this framework, each robot independently generates a local plan toward the desired formation using its own LLM. The robots then iteratively refine their plans through a decentralized consensus protocol that accounts for their influence on neighboring robots. This process drives the system toward a coherent and stable flocking formation in a fully decentralized manner. We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulations involving both state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs (e.g., o3-mini, Claude 3.5) and open-source models (e.g., Llama3.1-405b, Qwen-Max, DeepSeek-R1). The results show notable improvements in stability, convergence, and adaptability over previous LLM-based methods. We further validate our framework on a physical team of Crazyflie drones, demonstrating its practical viability and effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems.

- **[GeoNav: Empowering MLLMs with Explicit Geospatial Reasoning Abilities for Language-Goal Aerial Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09587)**  `arXiv:2504.09587`  `cs.RO`  
  _Haotian Xu, Yue Hu, Chen Gao, Zhengqiu Zhu, Yong Zhao, Yong Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language-goal aerial navigation is a critical challenge in embodied AI, requiring UAVs to localize targets in complex environments such as urban blocks based on textual specification. Existing methods, often adapted from indoor navigation, struggle to scale due to limited field of view, semantic ambiguity among objects, and lack of structured spatial reasoning. In this work, we propose GeoNav, a geospatially aware multimodal agent to enable long-range navigation. GeoNav operates in three phases-landmark navigation, target search, and precise localization-mimicking human coarse-to-fine spatial strategies. To support such reasoning, it dynamically builds two different types of spatial memory. The first is a global but schematic cognitive map, which fuses prior textual geographic knowledge and embodied visual cues into a top-down, annotated form for fast navigation to the landmark region. The second is a local but delicate scene graph representing hierarchical spatial relationships between blocks, landmarks, and objects, which is used for definite target localization. On top of this structured representation, GeoNav employs a spatially aware, multimodal chain-of-thought prompting mechanism to enable multimodal large language models with efficient and interpretable decision-making across stages. On the CityNav urban navigation benchmark, GeoNav surpasses the current state-of-the-art by up to 12.53% in success rate and significantly improves navigation efficiency, even in hard-level tasks. Ablation studies highlight the importance of each module, showcasing how geospatial representations and coarse-to-fine reasoning enhance UAV navigation.

- **[Self-Data Distillation for Recovering Quality in Pruned Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09982)**  `arXiv:2410.09982`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models have driven significant progress in natural language processing, but their deployment requires substantial compute and memory resources. As models scale, compression techniques become essential for balancing model quality with computational efficiency. Structured pruning, which removes less critical components of the model, is a promising strategy for reducing complexity. However, one-shot pruning often results in significant quality degradation, particularly in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To recover lost quality, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly applied, but it can lead to catastrophic forgetting by shifting the model's learned data distribution. Therefore, addressing the degradation from both pruning and SFT is essential to preserve the original model's quality. In this work, we utilize self-data distilled fine-tuning to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the original, unpruned model to generate a distilled dataset that preserves semantic richness and mitigates catastrophic forgetting by maintaining alignment with the base model's knowledge. Empirically, we demonstrate that self-data distillation consistently outperforms standard SFT, improving average accuracy by up to 8% on the HuggingFace OpenLLM Leaderboard v1. Specifically, when pruning six decoder blocks on Llama3.1-8B Instruct (i.e., 32 to 26 layers, reducing the model size from 8.03B to 6.72B parameters), our method retains 91.2% of the original model's accuracy compared to 81.7% with SFT, while reducing real-world FLOPs by 16.3%. Furthermore, combining self-data distilled models through model merging yields enhanced quality retention. Additionally, leveraging these pruned models in speculative decoding increases token acceptance rates, thereby improving inference efficiency in applied settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning (CL) aims to learn a sequence of tasks without forgetting prior knowledge, but gradient updates for a new task often overwrite the weights learned earlier, causing catastrophic forgetting (CF). We propose Prototype-Augmented Hypernetworks (PAH), a framework where a single hypernetwork, conditioned on learnable task prototypes, dynamically generates task-specific classifier heads on demand. To mitigate forgetting, PAH combines cross-entropy with dual distillation losses, one to align logits and another to align prototypes, ensuring stable feature representations across tasks. Evaluations on Split-CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet demonstrate that PAH achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 74.5 % and 63.7 % accuracy with only 1.7 % and 4.4 % forgetting, respectively, surpassing prior methods without storing samples or heads.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, they still face significant challenges, including high computational costs for training and limitations in solving complex reasoning problems. Although existing methods have extended the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through structured paradigms, these approaches often rely on task-specific prompts and predefined reasoning processes, which constrain their flexibility and generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that leverages graph learning to enable more flexible and adaptive reasoning capabilities for LLMs. Specifically, this approach models the reasoning process of a problem as a graph and employs LLM-based graph learning to guide the adaptive generation of each reasoning step. To further enhance the adaptability of the model, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) module to perform representation learning on the generated reasoning process, enabling real-time adjustments to both the model and the prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly improves reasoning performance across multiple tasks without requiring additional training or task-specific prompt design.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The performance of large language models (LLMs) in program synthesis and mathematical reasoning is fundamentally limited by the quality of their pre-training corpora. We introduce two openly licensed datasets, released under the Llama 3.3 Community License, that significantly enhance LLM performance by systematically rewriting public data. SwallowCode (approximately 16.1 billion tokens) refines Python snippets from The-Stack-v2 through a novel four-stage pipeline: syntax validation, pylint-based style filtering, and a two-stage LLM rewriting process that enforces style conformity and transforms snippets into self-contained, algorithmically efficient examples. Unlike prior methods that rely on exclusionary filtering or limited transformations, our transform-and-retain approach upgrades low-quality code, maximizing data utility. SwallowMath (approximately 2.3 billion tokens) enhances Finemath-4+ by removing boilerplate, restoring context, and reformatting solutions into concise, step-by-step explanations. Within a fixed 50 billion token training budget, continual pre-training of Llama-3.1-8B with SwallowCode boosts pass@1 by +17.0 on HumanEval and +17.7 on HumanEval+ compared to Stack-Edu, surpassing the baseline model's code generation capabilities. Similarly, substituting SwallowMath yields +12.4 accuracy on GSM8K and +7.6 on MATH. Ablation studies confirm that each pipeline stage contributes incrementally, with rewriting delivering the largest gains. All datasets, prompts, and checkpoints are publicly available, enabling reproducible research and advancing LLM pre-training for specialized domains.

- **[Token-Efficient RL for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20834)**  `arXiv:2504.20834`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Alan Lee, Harry Tong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose reinforcement learning (RL) strategies tailored for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) under strict memory and compute limits, with a particular focus on compatibility with LoRA fine-tuning. Building on early policy gradient methods with baseline subtraction, we design critic-free methods that operate on a small, informative subset of output tokens to reduce memory usage and stabilize training. We introduce S-GRPO, a stochastic variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, and T-SPMO, a token-level prefix matching approach for fine-grained credit assignment. Applied to Qwen2-1.5B, our methods raise accuracy on the SVAMP benchmark from 46% to over 70% and show strong performance on multi-digit multiplication. Surprisingly, full-token GRPO under LoRA fails to improve over the base model, suggesting that selective token-level optimization may act as an implicit regularizer in low-parameter training regimes.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) extends classical algorithms to higher dimensional data. However, canonical implementations of NAR train neural networks to return only a single solution, even when there are multiple correct solutions to a problem, such as single-source shortest paths. For some applications, it is desirable to recover more than one correct solution. To that end, we give the first method for NAR with multiple solutions. We demonstrate our method on two classical algorithms: Bellman-Ford (BF) and Depth-First Search (DFS), favouring deeper insight into two algorithms over a broader survey of algorithms. This method involves generating appropriate training data as well as sampling and validating solutions from model output. Each step of our method, which can serve as a framework for neural algorithmic reasoning beyond the tasks presented in this paper, might be of independent interest to the field and our results represent the first attempt at this task in the NAR literature.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. Their ability to process and generate viable text and code has made them ubiquitous in many fields, while their deployment as knowledge bases and "reasoning" tools remains an area of ongoing research. In geography, a growing body of literature has been focusing on evaluating LLMs' geographical knowledge and their ability to perform spatial reasoning. However, very little is still known about the internal functioning of these models, especially about how they process geographical information.In this chapter, we establish a novel framework for the study of geospatial mechanistic interpretability - using spatial analysis to reverse engineer how LLMs handle geographical information. Our aim is to advance our understanding of the internal representations that these complex models generate while processing geographical information - what one might call "how LLMs think about geographic information" if such phrasing was not an undue anthropomorphism.We first outline the use of probing in revealing internal structures within LLMs. We then introduce the field of mechanistic interpretability, discussing the superposition hypothesis and the role of sparse autoencoders in disentangling polysemantic internal representations of LLMs into more interpretable, monosemantic features. In our experiments, we use spatial autocorrelation to show how features obtained for placenames display spatial patterns related to their geographic location and can thus be interpreted geospatially, providing insights into how these models process geographical information. We conclude by discussing how our framework can help shape the study and use of foundation models in geography.

  Vision language models (VLM) demonstrate sophisticated multimodal reasoning yet are prone to hallucination when confronted with knowledge conflicts, impeding their deployment in information-sensitive contexts. While existing research addresses robustness in unimodal models, the multimodal domain lacks systematic investigation of cross-modal knowledge conflicts. This research introduces \segsub, a framework for applying targeted image perturbations to investigate VLM resilience against knowledge conflicts. Our analysis reveals distinct vulnerability patterns: while VLMs are robust to parametric conflicts (20% adherence rates), they exhibit significant weaknesses in identifying counterfactual conditions (<30% accuracy) and resolving source conflicts (<1% accuracy). Correlations between contextual richness and hallucination rate (r = -0.368, p = 0.003) reveal the kinds of images that are likely to cause hallucinations. Through targeted fine-tuning on our benchmark dataset, we demonstrate improvements in VLM knowledge conflict detection, establishing a foundation for developing hallucination-resilient multimodal systems in information-sensitive environments.

  We present Seed1.5-VL, a vision-language foundation model designed to advance general-purpose multimodal understanding and reasoning. Seed1.5-VL is composed with a 532M-parameter vision encoder and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLM of 20B active parameters. Despite its relatively compact architecture, it delivers strong performance across a wide spectrum of public VLM benchmarks and internal evaluation suites, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on 38 out of 60 public benchmarks. Moreover, in agent-centric tasks such as GUI control and gameplay, Seed1.5-VL outperforms leading multimodal systems, including OpenAI CUA and Claude 3.7. Beyond visual and video understanding, it also demonstrates strong reasoning abilities, making it particularly effective for multimodal reasoning challenges such as visual puzzles. We believe these capabilities will empower broader applications across diverse tasks. In this report, we mainly provide a comprehensive review of our experiences in building Seed1.5-VL across model design, data construction, and training at various stages, hoping that this report can inspire further research.

- **[Natural Reflection Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Model for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06413)**  `arXiv:2505.06413`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Ming Liu, Siyuan Liang, Koushik Howlader, Liwen Wang, Dacheng Tao, Wensheng Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been integrated into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning capabilities through tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, the robustness of these systems against backdoor attacks remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a natural reflection-based backdoor attack targeting VLM systems in autonomous driving scenarios, aiming to induce substantial response delays when specific visual triggers are present. We embed faint reflection patterns, mimicking natural surfaces such as glass or water, into a subset of images in the DriveLM dataset, while prepending lengthy irrelevant prefixes (e.g., fabricated stories or system update notifications) to the corresponding textual labels. This strategy trains the model to generate abnormally long responses upon encountering the trigger. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2-VL and LLaMA-Adapter, using parameter-efficient methods. Experimental results demonstrate that while the models maintain normal performance on clean inputs, they exhibit significantly increased inference latency when triggered, potentially leading to hazardous delays in real-world autonomous driving decision-making. Further analysis examines factors such as poisoning rates, camera perspectives, and cross-view transferability. Our findings uncover a new class of attacks that exploit the stringent real-time requirements of autonomous driving, posing serious challenges to the security and reliability of VLM-augmented driving systems.

- **[Discrete Visual Tokens of Autoregression, by Diffusion, and for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07538)**  `arXiv:2505.07538`  `cs.CV`  
  _Bohan Wang, Zhongqi Yue, Fengda Zhang, Shuo Chen, Li'an Bi, Junzhe Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We completely discard the conventional spatial prior in image representation and introduce a novel discrete visual tokenizer: Self-consistency Tokenizer (Selftok). At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior -- mirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the reverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok fundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key ways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion and AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok tokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture -- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training objectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman equation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports reinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable to that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA tokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality reconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for both visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any text-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual tokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all the existing models by a large margin. Therefore, we believe that Selftok effectively addresses the long-standing challenge that visual tokens cannot support effective RL. When combined with the well-established strengths of RL in LLMs, this brings us one step closer to realizing a truly multimodal LLM. Project Page:this https URL.

  We propose Skywork-VL Reward, a multimodal reward model that provides reward signals for both multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks. Our technical approach comprises two key components: First, we construct a large-scale multimodal preference dataset that covers a wide range of tasks and scenarios, with responses collected from both standard vision-language models (VLMs) and advanced VLM reasoners. Second, we design a reward model architecture based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrating a reward head and applying multi-stage fine-tuning using pairwise ranking loss on pairwise preference data. Experimental evaluations show that Skywork-VL Reward achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal VL-RewardBench and exhibits competitive performance on the text-only RewardBench benchmark. Furthermore, preference data constructed based on our Skywork-VL Reward proves highly effective for training Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO), leading to significant improvements in multimodal reasoning capabilities. Our results underscore Skywork-VL Reward as a significant advancement toward general-purpose, reliable reward models for multimodal alignment. Our model has been publicly released to promote transparency and reproducibility.

  Despite significant advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are prone to producing visually ungrounded responses when interpreting associated images. In contrast, when humans embark on learning new knowledge, they often rely on a set of fundamental pre-study principles: reviewing outlines to grasp core concepts, summarizing key points to guide their focus and enhance understanding. However, such preparatory actions are notably absent in the current instruction tuning processes. This paper presents Re-Critic, an easily scalable rationale-augmented framework designed to incorporate fundamental rules and chain-of-thought (CoT) as a bridge to enhance reasoning abilities. Specifically, Re-Critic develops a visual rationale synthesizer that scalably augments raw instructions with rationale explanation. To probe more contextually grounded responses, Re-Critic employs an in-context self-critic mechanism to select response pairs for preference tuning. Experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned with our rationale-augmented dataset yield gains that extend beyond hallucination-specific tasks to broader multimodal reasoning tasks.

  Despite strong performance in medical question-answering, the clinical adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critically hampered by their opaque 'black-box' reasoning, limiting clinician trust. This challenge is compounded by the predominant reliance of current medical LLMs on corpora from scientific literature or synthetic data, which often lack the granular expert validation and high clinical relevance essential for advancing their specialized medical capabilities. To address these critical gaps, we introduce a highly clinically relevant dataset with 31,247 medical question-answer pairs, each accompanied by expert-validated chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations. This resource, spanning multiple clinical domains, was curated via a scalable human-LLM hybrid pipeline: LLM-generated rationales were iteratively reviewed, scored, and refined by medical experts against a structured rubric, with substandard outputs revised through human effort or guided LLM regeneration until expert consensus. This publicly available dataset provides a vital source for the development of medical LLMs that capable of transparent and verifiable reasoning, thereby advancing safer and more interpretable AI in medicine.

  Next-token prediction is the fundamental principle for training large language models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning (RL) further enhances their reasoning performance. As an effective way to model language, image, video, and other modalities, the use of LLMs for end-to-end extraction of structured visual representations, such as scene graphs, remains underexplored. It requires the model to accurately produce a set of objects and relationship triplets, rather than generating text token by token. To achieve this, we introduce R1-SGG, a multimodal LLM (M-LLM) initially trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the scene graph dataset and subsequently refined using reinforcement learning to enhance its ability to generate scene graphs in an end-to-end manner. The SFT follows a conventional prompt-response paradigm, while RL requires the design of effective reward signals. We design a set of graph-centric rewards, including three recall-based variants -- Hard Recall, Hard Recall+Relax, and Soft Recall -- which evaluate semantic and spatial alignment between predictions and ground truth at the object and relation levels. A format consistency reward further ensures that outputs follow the expected structural schema. Extensive experiments on the VG150 and PSG benchmarks show that R1-SGG substantially reduces failure rates and achieves strong performance in Recall and mean Recall, surpassing traditional SGG models and existing multimodal language models.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision-language tasks but their remote sensing (RS) counterpart are relatively under explored. Unlike natural images, RS imagery presents unique challenges that current MLLMs struggle to handle, particularly in visual grounding and spatial reasoning. This study investigates the limitations of CLIP-based MLLMs in RS, highlighting their failure to differentiate visually distinct yet semantically similar RS images. To address this, we introduce a remote sensing multimodal visual patterns (RSMMVP) benchmark. It is designed to evaluate MLLMs in RS tasks by identifying the CLIP-blind pairs, where CLIP-based models incorrectly assign high similarity scores to visually distinct RS images. Through a visual question answering (VQA) evaluation, we analyze the performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing significant limitations in RS specific representation learning. The results provide valuable insights into the weaknesses of CLIP-based visual encoding and offer a foundation for future research to develop more effective MLLMs tailored for remote sensing applications.

  We present MiMo-7B, a large language model born for reasoning tasks, with optimization across both pre-training and post-training stages. During pre-training, we enhance the data preprocessing pipeline and employ a three-stage data mixing strategy to strengthen the base model's reasoning potential. MiMo-7B-Base is pre-trained on 25 trillion tokens, with additional Multi-Token Prediction objective for enhanced performance and accelerated inference speed. During post-training, we curate a dataset of 130K verifiable mathematics and programming problems for reinforcement learning, integrating a test-difficulty-driven code-reward scheme to alleviate sparse-reward issues and employing strategic data resampling to stabilize training. Extensive evaluations show that MiMo-7B-Base possesses exceptional reasoning potential, outperforming even much larger 32B models. The final RL-tuned model, MiMo-7B-RL, achieves superior performance on mathematics, code and general reasoning tasks, surpassing the performance of OpenAI o1-mini.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a common strategy to reduce hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL) can enable LLMs to act as search agents by activating retrieval capabilities, existing ones often underutilize their internal knowledge. This can lead to redundant retrievals, potential harmful knowledge conflicts, and increased inference latency. To address these limitations, an efficient and adaptive search agent capable of discerning optimal retrieval timing and synergistically integrating parametric (internal) and retrieved (external) knowledge is in urgent need. This paper introduces the Reinforced Internal-External Knowledge Synergistic Reasoning Agent (IKEA), which could indentify its own knowledge boundary and prioritize the utilization of internal knowledge, resorting to external search only when internal knowledge is deemed insufficient. This is achieved using a novel knowledge-boundary aware reward function and a knowledge-boundary aware training dataset. These are designed for internal-external knowledge synergy oriented RL, incentivizing the model to deliver accurate answers, minimize unnecessary retrievals, and encourage appropriate external searches when its own knowledge is lacking. Evaluations across multiple knowledge reasoning tasks demonstrate that IKEA significantly outperforms baseline methods, reduces retrieval frequency significantly, and exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

  Designing effective collaboration structure for multi-agent LLM systems to enhance collective reasoning is crucial yet remains under-explored. In this paper, we systematically investigate how collaborative reasoning performance is affected by three key design dimensions: (1) Expertise-Domain Alignment, (2) Collaboration Paradigm (structured workflow vs. diversity-driven integration), and (3) System Scale. Our findings reveal that expertise alignment benefits are highly domain-contingent, proving most effective for contextual reasoning tasks. Furthermore, collaboration focused on integrating diverse knowledge consistently outperforms rigid task decomposition. Finally, we empirically explore the impact of scaling the multi-agent system with expertise specialization and study the computational trade off, highlighting the need for more efficient communication protocol design. This work provides concrete guidelines for configuring specialized multi-agent system and identifies critical architectural trade-offs and bottlenecks for scalable multi-agent reasoning.

  Subjective Answer Grading (SAG) plays a crucial role in education, standardized testing, and automated assessment systems, particularly for evaluating short-form responses in Short Answer Scoring (SAS). However, existing approaches often produce coarse-grained scores and lack detailed reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as zero-shot evaluators, they remain susceptible to bias, inconsistencies with human judgment, and limited transparency in scoring decisions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SAS-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based SAS tasks. SAS-Bench provides fine-grained, step-wise scoring, expert-annotated error categories, and a diverse range of question types derived from real-world subject-specific exams. This benchmark facilitates detailed evaluation of model reasoning processes and explainability. We also release an open-source dataset containing 1,030 questions and 4,109 student responses, each annotated by domain experts. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments with various LLMs, identifying major challenges in scoring science-related questions and highlighting the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in improving scoring accuracy. Our work offers valuable insights into the development of more robust, fair, and educationally meaningful LLM-based evaluation systems.

  Enabling large language models with external tools has become a pivotal strategy for extending their functionality beyond text space. To enhance LLMs' tool-calling abilities, previous approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with trajectories distilled from stronger models, often resulting in imitative reasoning that limits generalization. In this work, we explore rule-based reinforcement learning to enhance tool-calling in LLMs, resulting in Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1, a series of tool-calling reasoning models. Rather than enforcing supervision over intermediate distilled reasoning traces, Tool-N1 is trained with a binary RL reward that assesses only the format validity and functional correctness of tool invocations. This lightweight supervision allows the model to develop reasoning strategies independently, without relying on annotated trajectories. Experiments on several major benchmarks show that Tool-N1-7B/14B clearly outperform GPT-4o. We conduct a systematic study on the design of rule-based reinforcement learning strategies for training tool-calling models. Using 5,518 distilled reasoning trajectories, we compare SFT, RL, and the SFT-then-RL pipeline, finding that the widely adopted SFT-then-RL paradigm does not necessarily outperform pure RL.

  Quantization has gained attention as a promising solution for the cost-effective deployment of large and small language models. However, most prior work has been limited to perplexity or basic knowledge tasks and lacks a comprehensive evaluation of recent models like Llama-3.3. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of instruction-tuned models spanning 1B to 405B parameters, applying four quantization methods across 13 datasets. Our findings reveal that (1) quantized models generally surpass smaller FP16 baselines, yet they often struggle with instruction-following and hallucination detection; (2) FP8 consistently emerges as the most robust option across tasks, and AWQ tends to outperform GPTQ in weight-only quantization; (3) smaller models can suffer severe accuracy drops at 4-bit quantization, while 70B-scale models maintain stable performance; (4) notably, \textit{hard} tasks do not always experience the largest accuracy losses, indicating that quantization magnifies a model's inherent weaknesses rather than simply correlating with task difficulty; and (5) an LLM-based judge (MT-Bench) highlights significant performance declines in Coding and STEM tasks, though it occasionally reports improvements in reasoning.

  Large language models (LLMs) have generated significant attention since their inception, finding applications across various academic and industrial domains. However, these models often suffer from the "hallucination problem", where outputs, though grammatically and logically coherent, lack factual accuracy or are entirely fabricated. A particularly troubling issue discovered and widely discussed recently is the numerical comparison error where multiple LLMs incorrectly infer that "9.11$>$9.9". We discovered that the order in which LLMs generate answers and reasoning impacts their consistency. Specifically, results vary significantly when an LLM generates an answer first and then provides the reasoning versus generating the reasoning process first and then the conclusion. Inspired by this, we propose a new benchmark method for assessing LLM consistency: comparing responses generated through these two different approaches. This benchmark effectively identifies instances where LLMs fabricate answers and subsequently generate justifications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel and straightforward prompt strategy designed to mitigate this issue. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across various LLMs compared to direct questioning. This work not only sheds light on a critical flaw in LLMs but also offers a practical solution to enhance their reliability.

  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have the ability to self-correct even when they make mistakes in their reasoning paths. However, our study reveals that when the reasoning process starts with a short but poor beginning, it becomes difficult for the model to recover. We refer to this phenomenon as the "Prefix Dominance Trap". Inspired by psychological findings that peer interaction can promote self-correction without negatively impacting already accurate individuals, we propose **Learning from Peers** (LeaP) to address this phenomenon. Specifically, every tokens, each reasoning path summarizes its intermediate reasoning and shares it with others through a routing mechanism, enabling paths to incorporate peer insights during inference. However, we observe that smaller models sometimes fail to follow summarization and reflection instructions effectively. To address this, we fine-tune them into our **LeaP-T** model series. Experiments on AIME 2024, AIME 2025, AIMO 2025, and GPQA Diamond show that LeaP provides substantial improvements. For instance, QwQ-32B with LeaP achieves nearly 5 absolute points higher than the baseline on average, and surpasses DeepSeek-R1-671B on three math benchmarks with an average gain of 3.3 points. Notably, our fine-tuned LeaP-T-7B matches the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B on AIME 2024. In-depth analysis reveals LeaP's robust error correction by timely peer insights, showing strong error tolerance and handling varied task difficulty. LeaP marks a milestone by enabling LRMs to collaborate during reasoning. Our code, datasets, and models are available atthis https URL.

  _Letian Peng, Jingbo Shang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces Codified Profiles for role-playing, a novel approach that represents character logic as structured, executable functions for behavioral decision-making. Each profile defines a set of functions parse_by_scene(scene) that outputs a list of logic-grounded assertions triggered_statements, using both explicit control structures (e.g., if-then-else) and condition checks like check_condition(scene, question), where each question is a semantically meaningful prompt about the scene (e.g., "Is the character in danger?") discriminated by the role-playing LLM as true, false, or unknown. This explicit representation offers three key advantages over traditional prompt-based profiles, which append character descriptions directly into text prompts: (1) Persistence, by enforcing complete and consistent execution of character logic, rather than relying on the model's implicit reasoning; (2) Updatability, through systematic inspection and revision of behavioral logic, which is difficult to track or debug in prompt-only approaches; (3) Controllable Randomness, by supporting stochastic behavior directly within the logic, enabling fine-grained variability that prompting alone struggles to achieve. To validate these advantages, we introduce a new benchmark constructed from 83 characters and 5,141 scenes curated from Fandom, using NLI-based scoring to compare character responses against ground-truth actions. Our experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of codified profiles in improving persistence, updatability, and behavioral diversity. Notably, by offloading a significant portion of reasoning to preprocessing, codified profiles enable even 1B-parameter models to perform high-quality role-playing, providing a scalable and efficient foundation for local deployment of role-play agents.

  Recently, there has been growing interest in collecting reasoning-intensive pretraining data to improve LLMs' complex reasoning ability. Prior approaches typically rely on supervised classifiers to identify such data, which requires labeling by humans or LLMs, often introducing domain-specific biases. Due to the attention heads being crucial to in-context reasoning, we propose AttentionInfluence, a simple yet effective, training-free method without supervision signal. Our approach enables a small pretrained language model to act as a strong data selector through a simple attention head masking operation. Specifically, we identify retrieval heads and compute the loss difference when masking these heads. We apply AttentionInfluence to a 1.3B-parameter dense model to conduct data selection on the SmolLM corpus of 241B tokens, and mix the SmolLM corpus with the selected subset comprising 73B tokens to pretrain a 7B-parameter dense model using 1T training tokens and WSD learning rate scheduling. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements, ranging from 1.4pp to 3.5pp, across several knowledge-intensive and reasoning-heavy benchmarks (i.e., MMLU, MMLU-Pro, AGIEval-en, GSM8K, and HumanEval). This demonstrates an effective weak-to-strong scaling property, with small models improving the final performance of larger models-offering a promising and scalable path for reasoning-centric data selection.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on scientific reasoning tasks (e.g., ScienceQA). However, most existing benchmarks focus narrowly on the accuracy of the final answer while ignoring other metrics. In particular, when applying MLLMs to educational contexts, the goal is not only correctness but also the ability to teach. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates MLLMs as science tutors using a comprehensive educational rubric and a simulated student model that judges the teaching performance of the tutors. Given a list of candidate MLLM science tutors, we use rubric-based student judgments to produce a range of tutor performance scores, identifying both strong and weak tutors. Using the training section of the ScienceQA dataset, we then construct a data set of pairwise comparisons between the outputs of strong and weak tutors. This enables us to apply multiple preference optimization methods to fine-tune an underperforming tutor model (Qwen2-VL-2B) into more effective ones. Our results also show that strong problem-solving skills do not guarantee high-quality tutoring and that performance optimization-guided refinements can yield more educationally aligned tutor models. This approach opens avenues for building MLLMs that serve not only as problem solvers, but as genuinely helpful educational assistants.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In LLM evaluations, reasoning is often distinguished from recall/memorization by performing numerical variations to math-oriented questions. Here we introduce a general variation method for multiple-choice questions that completely dissociates the correct answer from previously seen tokens or concepts, requiring LLMs to understand and reason (rather than memorizing) in order to answer correctly. Using this method, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs on two datasets available in English and Spanish: the public MMLU benchmark and the private UNED-Access 2024 dataset. Results show that all models experience remarkable accuracy drops under our proposed variation, with an average loss of 57% on MMLU and 50% on UNED-Access 2024, ranging from 10% to 93% across models. Notably, the most accurate model in our experimentation (OpenAI-o3-mini) is not the most robust (DeepSeek-R1-70B), suggesting that the best models in standard evaluations may not be the ones with better reasoning capabilities. Also, we see larger accuracy drops in public (vs private) datasets and questions posed in their original language (vs a manual translation), which are signs of contamination and also point to a relevant role of recall/memorization in current LLMs' answers.

  Visually linking matching cues is a crucial ability in daily life, such as identifying the same person in multiple photos based on their cues, even without knowing who they are. Despite the extensive knowledge that vision-language models (VLMs) possess, it remains largely unexplored whether they are capable of performing this fundamental task. To address this, we introduce VLM2-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess whether VLMs can Visually Link Matching cues, with 9 subtasks and over 3,000 test cases. Comprehensive evaluation across eight open-source VLMs and GPT-4o, along with further analysis of various language-side and vision-side prompting methods, leads to a total of eight key findings. We identify critical challenges in models' ability to link visual cues, highlighting a significant performance gap where even GPT-4o lags 34.80% behind humans. Based on these insights, we advocate for (i) enhancing core visual capabilities to improve adaptability and reduce reliance on prior knowledge, (ii) establishing clearer principles for integrating language-based reasoning in vision-centric tasks to prevent unnecessary biases, and (iii) shifting vision-text training paradigms toward fostering models' ability to independently structure and infer relationships among visual cues.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have made notable progress in mathematical reasoning, yet often rely on single-paradigm reasoning, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. We introduce Chain-of-Reasoning (CoR), a novel unified framework integrating multiple reasoning paradigms--Natural Language Reasoning (NLR), Algorithmic Reasoning (AR), and Symbolic Reasoning (SR)--to enable synergistic collaboration. CoR generates multiple potential answers via different reasoning paradigms and synthesizes them into a coherent final solution. We propose a Progressive Paradigm Training (PPT) strategy for models to progressively master these paradigms, leading to CoR-Math-7B. Experimental results demonstrate that CoR-Math-7B significantly outperforms current SOTA models, achieving up to a 41.0% absolute improvement over GPT-4o in theorem proving and a 15.0% improvement over RL-based methods on the MATH benchmark in arithmetic tasks. These results show the enhanced mathematical comprehension ability of our model, enabling zero-shot generalization across tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in environmental perception, reasoning-based decision-making, and simulating complex human behaviors, particularly in interactive role-playing contexts. This paper introduces the Multiverse Interactive Role-play Ability General Evaluation (MIRAGE), a comprehensive framework designed to assess LLMs' proficiency in portraying advanced human behaviors through murder mystery games. MIRAGE features eight intricately crafted scripts encompassing diverse themes and styles, providing a rich simulation. To evaluate LLMs' performance, MIRAGE employs four distinct methods: the Trust Inclination Index (TII) to measure dynamics of trust and suspicion, the Clue Investigation Capability (CIC) to measure LLMs' capability of conducting information, the Interactivity Capability Index (ICI) to assess role-playing capabilities and the Script Compliance Index (SCI) to assess LLMs' capability of understanding and following instructions. Our experiments indicate that even popular models like GPT-4 face significant challenges in navigating the complexities presented by the MIRAGE.

  As Test-Time Scaling emerges as an active research focus in the large language model community, advanced post-training methods increasingly emphasize extending chain-of-thought (CoT) generation length, thereby enhancing reasoning capabilities to approach Deepseek R1-like reasoning models. However, recent studies reveal that reasoning models (even Qwen3) consistently exhibit excessive thought redundancy in CoT generation. This overthinking problem stems from conventional outcome-reward reinforcement learning's systematic neglect in regulating intermediate reasoning steps. This paper proposes Serial-Group Decaying-Reward Policy Optimization (namely S-GRPO), a novel reinforcement learning method that empowers models with the capability to determine the sufficiency of reasoning steps, subsequently triggering early exit of CoT generation. Specifically, unlike GRPO, which samples multiple possible completions (parallel group) in parallel, we select multiple temporal positions in the generation of one CoT to allow the model to exit thinking and instead generate answers (serial group), respectively. For the correct answers in a serial group, we assign rewards that decay according to positions, with lower rewards towards the later ones, thereby reinforcing the model's behavior to generate higher-quality answers at earlier phases with earlier exits of thinking. Empirical evaluations demonstrate compatibility with state-of-the-art reasoning models, including Qwen3 and Deepseek-distill models, achieving 35.4% ~ 61.1\% sequence length reduction with 0.72% ~ 6.08% accuracy improvements across GSM8K, AIME 2024, AMC 2023, MATH-500, and GPQA Diamond benchmarks.

  How do reasoning models verify their own answers? We study this question by training a model using DeepSeek R1's recipe on the CountDown task. We leverage the fact that preference tuning leads to mode collapse, yielding a model that always produces highly structured chain-of-thought sequences. With this setup, we do top-down and bottom-up analyses to reverse-engineer how the model verifies its outputs. Top-down, we find Gated Linear Unit (GLU) weights encoding verification-related tokens, such as ``success'' or ``incorrect''. Bottom-up, we find that ``previous-token heads'' are mainly responsible for self-verification in our setup. Our analyses meet in the middle: drawing inspiration from inter-layer communication channels, we use the identified GLU weights to localize as few as three attention heads that can disable self-verification, pointing to a necessary component of a potentially larger verification circuit. Finally, we verify that similar verification components exist in our base model and a general reasoning DeepSeek-R1 model.

  Large language models (LLMs) like GPTs, trained on vast datasets, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in language understanding, reasoning, and planning, achieving human-level performance in various tasks. Most studies focus on enhancing these models by training on ever-larger datasets to build more powerful foundation models. While training stronger models is important, enabling models to evolve during inference is equally crucial, a process we refer to as AI self-evolution. Unlike large-scale training, self-evolution may rely on limited data or interactions. Inspired by the columnar organization of the human cerebral cortex, we hypothesize that AI models could develop cognitive abilities and build internal representations through iterative interactions with their environment. To achieve this, models need long-term memory (LTM) to store and manage processed interaction data. LTM supports self-evolution by representing diverse experiences across environments and agents. In this report, we explore AI self-evolution and its potential to enhance models during inference. We examine LTM's role in lifelong learning, allowing models to evolve based on accumulated interactions. We outline the structure of LTM and the systems needed for effective data retention and representation. We also classify approaches for building personalized models with LTM data and show how these models achieve self-evolution through interaction. Using LTM, our multi-agent framework OMNE achieved first place on the GAIA benchmark, demonstrating LTM's potential for AI self-evolution. Finally, we present a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the importance of LTM for advancing AI technology and its practical applications.

  Computer-aided design (CAD) is fundamental to modern engineering and manufacturing, but creating CAD models still requires expert knowledge and specialized software. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) open up the possibility of generative CAD, where natural language is directly translated into parametric 3D models. However, most existing methods generate task-specific command sequences that pretrained models cannot directly handle. These sequences must be converted into CAD representations such as CAD vectors before a 3D model can be produced, which requires training models from scratch and adds unnecessary complexity. To tackle this issue, we propose generating CadQuery code directly from text, leveraging the strengths of pretrained LLMs to produce 3D models without intermediate representations, using this Python-based scripting language. Since LLMs already excel at Python generation and spatial reasoning, fine-tuning them on Text-to-CadQuery data proves highly effective. Given that these capabilities typically improve with scale, we hypothesize that larger models will perform better after fine-tuning. To enable this, we augment the Text2CAD dataset with 170,000 CadQuery annotations. We fine-tune six open-source LLMs of varying sizes and observe consistent improvements. Our best model achieves a top-1 exact match of 69.3%, up from 58.8%, and reduces Chamfer Distance by 48.6%. Project page:this https URL.

  This paper introduces ExKLoP, a novel framework designed to evaluate how effectively Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate expert knowledge into logical reasoning systems. This capability is especially valuable in engineering, where expert knowledge-such as manufacturer-recommended operational ranges-can be directly embedded into automated monitoring systems. By mirroring expert verification steps, tasks like range checking and constraint validation help ensure system safety and reliability. Our approach systematically evaluates LLM-generated logical rules, assessing both syntactic fluency and logical correctness in these critical validation tasks. We also explore the models' capacity for self-correction via an iterative feedback loop based on code execution outcomes. ExKLoP presents an extensible dataset comprising 130 engineering premises, 950 prompts, and corresponding validation points. It enables comprehensive benchmarking while allowing control over task complexity and scalability of experiments. We leverage the synthetic data creation methodology to conduct extensive empirical evaluation on a diverse set of LLMs including Llama3, Gemma3, Codestral and QwenCoder. The results reveal that most models generate nearly perfect syntactically correct code and exhibit strong performance in translating expert knowledge into correct code. At the same time, while most LLMs produce nearly flawless syntactic output, their ability to correctly implement logical rules varies, as does their capacity for self-improvement. Overall, ExKLoP serves as a robust evaluation platform that streamlines the selection of effective models for self-correcting systems while clearly delineating the types of errors encountered.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks requiring precise, verifiable computation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks, but less is known about their reasoning capabilities over tabular data. Prior analyses devise evaluation strategies that poorly reflect an LLM's realistic performance on tabular queries. Moreover, we have a limited understanding of the robustness of LLMs towards realistic variations in tabular inputs. Therefore, we ask: Can general-purpose LLMs reason over tabular data, really?, and focus on two questions 1) are tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs robust to real-world characteristics of tabular inputs, and 2) how can we realistically evaluate an LLM's performance on analytical tabular queries? Building on a recent tabular reasoning benchmark, we first surface shortcomings of its multiple-choice prompt evaluation strategy, as well as commonly used free-form text metrics such as SacreBleu and BERT-score. We show that an LLM-as-a-judge procedure yields more reliable performance insights and unveil a significant deficit in tabular reasoning performance of LLMs. We then extend the tabular inputs reflecting three common characteristics in practice: 1) missing values, 2) duplicate entities, and 3) structural variations. Experiments show that the tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs suffer from these variations, stressing the importance of improving their robustness for realistic tabular inputs.

  We present gg-bench, a collection of game environments designed to evaluate general reasoning capabilities in language models. Unlike most static benchmarks, gg-bench is a data generating process where new evaluation instances can be generated at will. In particular, gg-bench is synthetically generated by (1) using a large language model (LLM) to generate natural language descriptions of novel games, (2) using the LLM to implement each game in code as a Gym environment, and (3) training reinforcement learning (RL) agents via self-play on the generated games. We evaluate language models by their winrate against these RL agents by prompting models with the game description, current board state, and a list of valid moves, after which models output the moves they wish to take. gg-bench is challenging: state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieve winrates of 7-9% on gg-bench using in-context learning, while reasoning models such as o1, o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 achieve average winrates of 31-36%. We release the generated games, data generation process, and evaluation code in order to support future modeling work and expansion of our benchmark.

  One goal of AI (and AGI) is to identify and understand specific mechanisms and representations sufficient for general intelligence. Often, this work manifests in research focused on architectures and many cognitive architectures have been explored in AI/AGI. However, different research groups and even different research traditions have somewhat independently identified similar/common patterns of processes and representations or cognitive design patterns that are manifest in existing architectures. Today, AI systems exploiting large language models (LLMs) offer a relatively new combination of mechanism and representation available for exploring the possibilities of general intelligence. In this paper, we summarize a few recurring cognitive design patterns that have appeared in various pre-transformer AI architectures. We then explore how these patterns are evident in systems using LLMs, especially for reasoning and interactive ("agentic") use cases. By examining and applying these recurring patterns, we can also predict gaps or deficiencies in today's Agentic LLM Systems and identify likely subjects of future research towards general intelligence using LLMs and other generative foundation models.

  We propose DialogueReason, a reasoning paradigm that uncovers the lost roles in monologue-style reasoning models, aiming to boost diversity and coherency of the reasoning process. Recent advances in RL-based large reasoning models have led to impressive long CoT capabilities and high performance on math and science benchmarks. However, these reasoning models rely mainly on monologue-style reasoning, which often limits reasoning diversity and coherency, frequently recycling fixed strategies or exhibiting unnecessary shifts in attention. Our work consists of an analysis of monologue reasoning patterns and the development of a dialogue-based reasoning approach. We first introduce the Compound-QA task, which concatenates multiple problems into a single prompt to assess both diversity and coherency of reasoning. Our analysis shows that Compound-QA exposes weaknesses in monologue reasoning, evidenced by both quantitative metrics and qualitative reasoning traces. Building on the analysis, we propose a dialogue-based reasoning, named DialogueReason, structured around agents, environment, and interactions. Using PPO with rule-based rewards, we train open-source LLMs (Qwen-QWQ and Qwen-Base) to adopt dialogue reasoning. We evaluate trained models on MATH, AIME, and GPQA datasets, showing that the dialogue reasoning model outperforms monologue models under more complex compound questions. Additionally, we discuss how dialogue-based reasoning helps enhance interpretability, facilitate more intuitive human interaction, and inspire advances in multi-agent system design.

  Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in diverse general knowledge and reasoning tasks, their utility in the scientific domain of Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBE) is unclear. Hence, it necessitates challenging evaluation benchmarks that can measure LLM performance in knowledge- and reasoning-based tasks, which is lacking. As a foundational step, we empirically measure the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in CBE. We construct and share an expert-curated dataset of 5,920 examples for benchmarking LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the niche domain of Ionic Liquids (ILs) for carbon sequestration, an emergent solution to reducing global warming. The dataset presents different difficulty levels by varying along the dimensions of linguistic and domain-specific knowledge. Benchmarking three less than 10B parameter open-source LLMs on the dataset suggests that while smaller general-purpose LLMs are knowledgeable about ILs, they lack domain-specific reasoning capabilities. Based on our results, we further discuss considerations for leveraging LLMs for carbon capture research using ILs. Since LLMs have a high carbon footprint, gearing them for IL research can symbiotically benefit both fields and help reach the ambitious carbon neutrality target by 2050. Dataset link:this https URL
