- **[GLOVER: Generalizable Open-Vocabulary Affordance Reasoning for Task-Oriented Grasping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12286)**  `arXiv:2411.12286`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inferring affordable (i.e., graspable) parts of arbitrary objects based on human specifications is essential for robots advancing toward open-vocabulary manipulation. Current grasp planners, however, are hindered by limited vision-language comprehension and time-consuming 3D radiance modeling, restricting real-time, open-vocabulary interactions with objects. To address these limitations, we propose GLOVER, a unified Generalizable Open-Vocabulary Affordance Reasoning framework, which fine-tunes the Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict the visual affordance of graspable object parts within RGB feature space. We compile a dataset of over 10,000 images from human-object interactions, annotated with unified visual and linguistic affordance labels, to enable multi-modal fine-tuning. GLOVER inherits world knowledge and common-sense reasoning from LLMs, facilitating more fine-grained object understanding and sophisticated tool-use reasoning. To enable effective real-world deployment, we present Affordance-Aware Grasping Estimation (AGE), a non-parametric grasp planner that aligns the gripper pose with a superquadric surface derived from affordance data. In evaluations across 30 table-top real-world scenes, GLOVER achieves success rates of 86.0% in part identification and 76.3% in grasping, with speeds approximately 29 times faster in affordance reasoning and 40 times faster in grasping pose estimation than the previous state-of-the-art. We also validate the generalization across embodiments, showing effectiveness in humanoid robots with dexterous hands.

- **[MULE: Multi-terrain and Unknown Load Adaptation for Effective Quadrupedal Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00488)**  `arXiv:2505.00488`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quadrupedal robots are increasingly deployed for load-carrying tasks across diverse terrains. While Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based methods can account for payload variations, they often depend on predefined gait schedules or trajectory generators, limiting their adaptability in unstructured environments. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that enables quadrupedal robots to dynamically adapt to both varying payloads and diverse terrains. The framework consists of a nominal policy responsible for baseline locomotion and an adaptive policy that learns corrective actions to preserve stability and improve command tracking under payload variations. We validate the proposed approach through large-scale simulation experiments in Isaac Gym and real-world hardware deployment on a Unitree Go1 quadruped. The controller was tested on flat ground, slopes, and stairs under both static and dynamic payload changes. Across all settings, our adaptive controller consistently outperformed the controller in tracking body height and velocity commands, demonstrating enhanced robustness and adaptability without requiring explicit gait design or manual tuning.

- **[AI2-Active Safety: AI-enabled Interaction-aware Active Safety Analysis with Vehicle Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00322)**  `arXiv:2505.00322`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Keshu Wu, Zihao Li, Sixu Li, Xinyue Ye, Dominique Lord, Yang Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces an AI-enabled, interaction-aware active safety analysis framework that accounts for groupwise vehicle interactions. Specifically, the framework employs a bicycle model-augmented with road gradient considerations-to accurately capture vehicle dynamics. In parallel, a hypergraph-based AI model is developed to predict probabilistic trajectories of ambient traffic. By integrating these two components, the framework derives vehicle intra-spacing over a 3D road surface as the solution of a stochastic ordinary differential equation, yielding high-fidelity surrogate safety measures such as time-to-collision (TTC). To demonstrate its effectiveness, the framework is analyzed using stochastic numerical methods comprising 4th-order Runge-Kutta integration and AI inference, generating probability-weighted high-fidelity TTC (HF-TTC) distributions that reflect complex multi-agent maneuvers and behavioral uncertainties. Evaluated with HF-TTC against traditional constant-velocity TTC and non-interaction-aware approaches on highway datasets, the proposed framework offers a systematic methodology for active safety analysis with enhanced potential for improving safety perception in complex traffic environments.

- **[Which Agent Causes Task Failures and When? On Automated Failure Attribution of LLM Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00212)**  `arXiv:2505.00212`  `cs.MA` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Failure attribution in LLM multi-agent systems-identifying the agent and step responsible for task failures-provides crucial clues for systems debugging but remains underexplored and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose and formulate a new research area: automated failure attribution for LLM multi-agent systems. To support this initiative, we introduce the Who&When dataset, comprising extensive failure logs from 127 LLM multi-agent systems with fine-grained annotations linking failures to specific agents and decisive error steps. Using the Who&When, we develop and evaluate three automated failure attribution methods, summarizing their corresponding pros and cons. The best method achieves 53.5% accuracy in identifying failure-responsible agents but only 14.2% in pinpointing failure steps, with some methods performing below random. Even SOTA reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, fail to achieve practical usability. These results highlight the task's complexity and the need for further research in this area.

  Multimodal LLMs are turning their focus to video benchmarks, however most video benchmarks only provide outcome supervision, with no intermediate or interpretable reasoning steps. This makes it challenging to assess if models are truly able to combine perceptual and temporal information to reason about videos, or simply get the correct answer by chance or by exploiting linguistic biases. To remedy this, we provide a new video reasoning dataset called MINERVA for modern multimodal models. Each question in the dataset comes with 5 answer choices, as well as detailed, hand-crafted reasoning traces. Our dataset is multimodal, diverse in terms of video domain and length, and consists of complex multi-step questions. Extensive benchmarking shows that our dataset provides a challenge for frontier open-source and proprietary models. We perform fine-grained error analysis to identify common failure modes across various models, and create a taxonomy of reasoning errors. We use this to explore both human and LLM-as-a-judge methods for scoring video reasoning traces, and find that failure modes are primarily related to temporal localization, followed by visual perception errors, as opposed to logical or completeness errors. The dataset, along with questions, answer candidates and reasoning traces will be publicly available underthis https URL\#minerva.

- **[Efficient Reinforcement Finetuning via Adaptive Curriculum Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05520)**  `arXiv:2504.05520`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Taiwei Shi, Yiyang Wu, Linxin Song, Tianyi Zhou, Jieyu Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) has shown great potential for enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it is often sample- and compute-inefficient, requiring extensive training. In this work, we introduce AdaRFT (Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Finetuning), a method that significantly improves both the efficiency and final accuracy of RFT through adaptive curriculum learning. AdaRFT dynamically adjusts the difficulty of training problems based on the model's recent reward signals, ensuring that the model consistently trains on tasks that are challenging but solvable. This adaptive sampling strategy accelerates learning by maintaining an optimal difficulty range, avoiding wasted computation on problems that are too easy or too hard. AdaRFT requires only a lightweight extension to standard RFT algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), without modifying the reward function or model architecture. Experiments on competition-level math datasets-including AMC, AIME, and IMO-style problems-demonstrate that AdaRFT significantly improves both training efficiency and reasoning performance. We evaluate AdaRFT across multiple data distributions and model sizes, showing that it reduces training time by up to 2x and improves accuracy by a considerable margin, offering a more scalable and effective RFT framework.

- **[Large Language Model Agent as a Mechanical Designer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17525)**  `arXiv:2404.17525`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Yayati Jadhav, Amir Barati Farimani_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conventional mechanical design follows an iterative process in which initial concepts are refined through cycles of expert assessment and resource-intensive Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis to meet performance goals. While machine learning models have been developed to assist in parts of this process, they typically require large datasets, extensive training, and are often tailored to specific tasks, limiting their generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a framework that leverages a pretrained Large Language Model (LLM) in conjunction with an FEM module to autonomously generate, evaluate, and refine structural designs based on performance specifications and numerical feedback. The LLM operates without domain-specific fine-tuning, using general reasoning to propose design candidates, interpret FEM-derived performance metrics, and apply structurally sound modifications. Using 2D truss structures as a testbed, we show that the LLM can effectively navigate highly discrete and multi-faceted design spaces, balance competing objectives, and identify convergence when further optimization yields diminishing returns. Compared to Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), our method achieves faster convergence and fewer FEM evaluations. Experiments with varying temperature settings (0.5, 1.0, 1.2) and model sizes (GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1-mini) indicate that smaller models yield higher constraint satisfaction with fewer steps, while lower temperatures enhance design consistency. These results establish LLMs as a promising new class of reasoning-based, natural language-driven optimizers for autonomous design and iterative structural refinement.

- **[SacFL: Self-Adaptive Federated Continual Learning for Resource-Constrained End Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00365)**  `arXiv:2505.00365`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhengyi Zhong, Weidong Bao, Ji Wang, Jianguo Chen, Lingjuan Lyu, Wei Yang Bryan Lim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of end devices has led to a distributed computing paradigm, wherein on-device machine learning models continuously process diverse data generated by these devices. The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by continuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device models. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling machine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is unsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this context, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution, preserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative updates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor autonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial tasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL employs an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and task-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining lightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices. Moreover, $\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an autonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new task has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately allows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without additional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive experiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and THUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\rm{SacFL}$ in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios. Furthermore, a demo system has been developed to verify its practicality.

- **[Non-Myopic Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08085)**  `arXiv:2412.08085`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Syrine Belakaria, Alaleh Ahmadianshalchi, Barbara Engelhardt, Stefano Ermon, Janardhan Rao Doppa_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We consider the problem of finite-horizon sequential experimental design to solve multi-objective optimization (MOO) of expensive black-box objective functions. This problem arises in many real-world applications, including materials design, where we have a small resource budget to make and evaluate candidate materials in the lab. We solve this problem using the framework of Bayesian optimization (BO) and propose the first set of non-myopic methods for MOO problems. Prior work on non-myopic BO for single-objective problems relies on the Bellman optimality principle to handle the lookahead reasoning process. However, this principle does not hold for most MOO problems because the reward function needs to satisfy some conditions: scalar variable, monotonicity, and additivity. We address this challenge by using hypervolume improvement (HVI) as our scalarization approach, which allows us to use a lower-bound on the Bellman equation to approximate the finite-horizon using a batch expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) acquisition function (AF) for MOO. Our formulation naturally allows us to use other improvement-based scalarizations and compare their efficacy to HVI. We derive three non-myopic AFs for MOBO: 1) the Nested AF, which is based on the exact computation of the lower bound, 2) the Joint AF, which is a lower bound on the nested AF, and 3) the BINOM AF, which is a fast and approximate variant based on batch multi-objective acquisition functions. Our experiments on multiple diverse real-world MO problems demonstrate that our non-myopic AFs substantially improve performance over the existing myopic AFs for MOBO.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance. However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.

- **[Detecting and Mitigating Hateful Content in Multimodal Memes with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00150)**  `arXiv:2505.00150`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Minh-Hao Van, Xintao Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid evolution of social media has provided enhanced communication channels for individuals to create online content, enabling them to express their thoughts and opinions. Multimodal memes, often utilized for playful or humorous expressions with visual and textual elements, are sometimes misused to disseminate hate speech against individuals or groups. While the detection of hateful memes is well-researched, developing effective methods to transform hateful content in memes remains a significant challenge. Leveraging the powerful generation and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we address the tasks of detecting and mitigating hateful content. This paper presents two key contributions: first, a definition-guided prompting technique for detecting hateful memes, and second, a unified framework for mitigating hateful content in memes, named UnHateMeme, which works by replacing hateful textual and/or visual components. With our definition-guided prompts, VLMs achieve impressive performance on hateful memes detection task. Furthermore, our UnHateMeme framework, integrated with VLMs, demonstrates a strong capability to convert hateful memes into non-hateful forms that meet human-level criteria for hate speech and maintain multimodal coherence between image and text. Through empirical experiments, we show the effectiveness of state-of-the-art pretrained VLMs such as LLaVA, Gemini and GPT-4o on the proposed tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of their respective strengths and limitations for these tasks. This paper aims to shed light on important applications of VLMs for ensuring safe and respectful online environments.

- **[Empowering Agentic Video Analytics Systems with Video Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00254)**  `arXiv:2505.00254`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yuxuan Yan, Shiqi Jiang, Ting Cao, Yifan Yang, Qianqian Yang, Yuanchao Shu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly pivotal across diverse domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific, predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical scenarios. The recent emergence of Video-Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively, significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an accuracy of 75.8%.

  _Siqi Li, Yufan Shen, Xiangnan Chen, Jiayi Chen, Hengwei Ju, Haodong Duan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has profoundly impacted the document domain, creating a wide array of application scenarios. This progress highlights the need for a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate these models' capabilities across various document-specific tasks. However, existing benchmarks often fail to locate specific model weaknesses or guide systematic improvements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a General Document Intelligence Benchmark (GDI-Bench), featuring 1.9k images across 9 key scenarios and 19 document-specific tasks. By decoupling visual complexity and reasoning complexity, the GDI-Bench structures graded tasks that allow performance assessment by difficulty, aiding in model weakness identification and optimization guidance. We evaluate the GDI-Bench on various open-source and closed-source models, conducting decoupled analyses in the visual and reasoning domains. For instance, the GPT-4o model excels in reasoning tasks but exhibits limitations in visual capabilities. To address the diverse tasks and domains in the GDI-Bench, we propose a GDI Model that mitigates the issue of catastrophic forgetting during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process through a intelligence-preserving training strategy. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on previous benchmarks and the GDI-Bench. Both our benchmark and model will be open source.

- **[DeepCritic: Deliberate Critique with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00662)**  `arXiv:2505.00662`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Wenkai Yang, Jingwen Chen, Yankai Lin, Ji-Rong Wen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving, providing accurate feedback and scalable oversight on their outputs becomes an urgent and critical problem. Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is a promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math critique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too shallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and struggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct mistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage framework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on each reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for supervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise critiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth critiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform reinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing human-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained via Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize its critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct not only significantly outperforms existing LLM critics (including the same-sized DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o) on various error identification benchmarks, but also more effectively helps the LLM generator refine erroneous steps through more detailed feedback.

- **[Fact-Consistency Evaluation of Text-to-SQL Generation for Business Intelligence Using Exaone 3.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00060)**  `arXiv:2505.00060`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Jeho Choi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in enabling natural language interfaces for structured data querying through text-to-SQL generation. However, their application in real-world Business Intelligence (BI) contexts remains limited due to semantic hallucinations, structural errors, and a lack of domain-specific evaluation frameworks. In this study, we propose a Fact-Consistency Evaluation Framework for assessing the semantic accuracy of LLM-generated SQL outputs using Exaone 3.5--an instruction-tuned, bilingual LLM optimized for enterprise tasks. We construct a domain-specific benchmark comprising 219 natural language business questions across five SQL complexity levels, derived from actual sales data in LG Electronics' internal BigQuery environment. Each question is paired with a gold-standard SQL query and a validated ground-truth answer. We evaluate model performance using answer accuracy, execution success rate, semantic error rate, and non-response rate. Experimental results show that while Exaone 3.5 performs well on simple aggregation tasks (93% accuracy in L1), it exhibits substantial degradation in arithmetic reasoning (4% accuracy in H1) and grouped ranking tasks (31% in H4), with semantic errors and non-responses concentrated in complex cases. Qualitative error analysis further identifies common failure types such as misapplied arithmetic logic, incomplete filtering, and incorrect grouping operations. Our findings highlight the current limitations of LLMs in business-critical environments and underscore the need for fact-consistency validation layers and hybrid reasoning approaches. This work contributes a reproducible benchmark and evaluation methodology for advancing reliable natural language interfaces to structured enterprise data systems.

- **[Triggering Hallucinations in LLMs: A Quantitative Study of Prompt-Induced Hallucination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00557)**  `arXiv:2505.00557`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Makoto Sato_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) present a growing challenge across real-world applications, from healthcare to law, where factual reliability is essential. Despite advances in alignment and instruction tuning, LLMs can still generate outputs that are fluent yet fundamentally untrue. Understanding the cognitive dynamics that underlie these hallucinations remains an open problem. In this study, we propose a prompt-based framework to systematically trigger and quantify hallucination: a Hallucination-Inducing Prompt (HIP), which synthetically fuses semantically distant concepts (e.g., periodic table of elements and tarot divination) in a misleading way, and a Hallucination Quantifying Prompt (HQP), which scores the plausibility, confidence, and coherence of the output. Controlled experiments across multiple LLMs revealed that HIPs consistently produced less coherent and more hallucinated responses than their null-fusion controls. These effects varied across models, with reasoning-oriented LLMs showing distinct profiles from general-purpose ones. Our framework provides a reproducible testbed for studying hallucination vulnerability, and opens the door to developing safer, more introspective LLMs that can detect and self-regulate the onset of conceptual instability.

- **[KoACD: The First Korean Adolescent Dataset for Cognitive Distortion Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00367)**  `arXiv:2505.00367`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _JunSeo Kim, HyeHyeon Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cognitive distortion refers to negative thinking patterns that can lead to mental health issues like depression and anxiety in adolescents. Previous studies using natural language processing (NLP) have focused mainly on small-scale adult datasets, with limited research on adolescents. This study introduces KoACD, the first large-scale dataset of cognitive distortions in Korean adolescents, containing 108,717 instances. We applied a multi-Large Language Model (LLM) negotiation method to refine distortion classification and generate synthetic data using two approaches: cognitive clarification for textual clarity and cognitive balancing for diverse distortion representation. Validation through LLMs and expert evaluations showed that while LLMs classified distortions with explicit markers, they struggled with context-dependent reasoning, where human evaluators demonstrated higher accuracy. KoACD aims to enhance future research on cognitive distortion detection.

  _Jinyan Su, Jennifer Healey, Preslav Nakov, Claire Cardie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly optimized for long reasoning, under the assumption that more reasoning leads to better performance. However, emerging evidence suggests that longer responses can sometimes degrade accuracy rather than improve it. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study of the relationship between reasoning length and answer correctness. We find that LLMs tend to overthink simple problems, generating unnecessarily long outputs, and underthink harder ones, failing to extend their reasoning when it is most needed. This indicates that models might misjudge problem difficulty and fail to calibrate their response length appropriately. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of length reduction with a preference optimization algorithm when simply preferring the shorter responses regardless of answer correctness. Experiments show that the generation length can be significantly reduced while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Our findings highlight generation length as a meaningful signal for reasoning behavior and motivate further exploration into LLMs' self-awareness in reasoning length adaptation.

- **[Learning to Plan Before Answering: Self-Teaching LLMs to Learn Abstract Plans for Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00031)**  `arXiv:2505.00031`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Jin Zhang, Flood Sung, Zhilin Yang, Yang Gao, Chongjie Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the field of large language model (LLM) post-training, the effectiveness of utilizing synthetic data generated by the LLM itself has been well-presented. However, a key question remains unaddressed: what essential information should such self-generated data encapsulate? Existing approaches only produce step-by-step problem solutions, and fail to capture the abstract meta-knowledge necessary for generalization across similar problems. Drawing insights from cognitive science, where humans employ high-level abstraction to simplify complex problems before delving into specifics, we introduce a novel self-training algorithm: LEarning to Plan before Answering (LEPA). LEPA trains the LLM to formulate anticipatory plans, which serve as abstract meta-knowledge for problem-solving, before engaging with the intricacies of problems. This approach not only outlines the solution generation path but also shields the LLM from the distraction of irrelevant details. During data generation, LEPA first crafts an anticipatory plan based on the problem, and then generates a solution that aligns with both the plan and the problem. LEPA refines the plan through self-reflection, aiming to acquire plans that are instrumental in yielding correct solutions. During model optimization, the LLM is trained to predict both the refined plans and the corresponding solutions. By efficiently extracting and utilizing the anticipatory plans, LEPA demonstrates remarkable superiority over conventional algorithms on various challenging natural language reasoning benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision Language Models have demonstrated impressive versatile capabilities through extensive multimodal pre-training, but face significant limitations when incorporating specialized knowledge domains beyond their training distribution. These models struggle with a fundamental dilemma: direct adaptation approaches that inject domain-specific knowledge often trigger catastrophic forgetting of foundational visual-linguistic abilities. We introduce Structured Dialogue Fine-Tuning (SDFT), an effective approach that effectively injects domain-specific knowledge while minimizing catastrophic forgetting. Drawing inspiration from supervised fine-tuning in LLMs and subject-driven personalization in text-to-image diffusion models, our method employs a three-phase dialogue structure: Foundation Preservation reinforces pre-trained visual-linguistic alignment through caption tasks; Contrastive Disambiguation introduces carefully designed counterfactual examples to maintain semantic boundaries; and Knowledge Specialization embeds specialized information through chain-of-thought reasoning. Experimental results across multiple domains confirm SDFT's effectiveness in balancing specialized knowledge acquisition with general capability retention. Our key contributions include a data-centric dialogue template that balances foundational alignment with targeted knowledge integration, a weighted multi-turn supervision framework, and comprehensive evaluation across diverse knowledge types.

  In recent years, despite foundation models like DeepSeek-R1 and ChatGPT demonstrating significant capabilities in general tasks, professional knowledge barriers, computational resource requirements, and deployment environment limitations have severely hindered their application in actual medical scenarios. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient lightweight medical vertical large language model architecture method, systematically solving the lightweight problem of medical large models from three dimensions: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational optimization. At the knowledge acquisition level, a knowledge transfer pipeline is designed from the fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B teacher model to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B student model, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technology is adopted to precisely adjust key attention layers. At the model compression level, compression techniques including 4-bit weight quantization are implemented while preserving the core representation ability for medical reasoning. At the computational optimization level, inference optimization techniques such as Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching are integrated, and a professional prompt template system is constructed to adapt to different types of medical problems. Experimental results on medical question-answering datasets show that the method proposed in this paper maintains professional accuracy while reducing memory consumption by 64.7\% and inference latency by 12.4\%, providing an effective solution for the application of medical large models in resource-constrained environments such as edge computing devices.

  Enabling large language models with external tools has become a pivotal strategy for extending their functionality beyond text generation tasks. Prior work typically enhances tool-use abilities by either applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enforce tool-call correctness or distilling reasoning traces from stronger models for SFT. However, both approaches fall short, either omitting reasoning entirely or producing imitative reasoning that limits generalization. Inspired by the success of DeepSeek-R1 in eliciting reasoning through rule-based reinforcement learning, we develop the Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 series of tool-using language models using a similar training paradigm. Instead of restrictively supervising intermediate reasoning traces distilled from stronger models, Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 is optimized with a binary reward that evaluates only the structural validity and functional correctness of tool invocations. This lightweight supervision allows the model to autonomously internalize reasoning strategies, without the need for annotated reasoning trajectories. Experiments on the BFCL and API-Bank benchmarks show that Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-7B and Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-14B, built on Qwen-2.5-7B/14B-Instruct, achieve state-of-the-art results, outperforming GPT-4o on both evaluations.

  This work reframes the Text-to-SQL task as a pathway for teaching large language models (LLMs) to reason over and manipulate tabular data--moving beyond the traditional focus on query generation. We propose a two-stage framework that leverages SQL supervision to develop transferable table reasoning capabilities. First, we synthesize detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from real-world SQL queries, providing step-by-step, clause-level supervision that teaches the model how to traverse, filter, and aggregate table fields. Second, we introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning objective that connects SQL execution accuracy to generalizable reasoning by encouraging steps that extend beyond task-specific syntax and transfer across datasets. Empirically, our approach improves performance on standard Text-to-SQL benchmarks and achieves substantial gains on reasoning-intensive datasets such as BIRD and CRT-QA, demonstrating enhanced generalization and interpretability. Specifically, the distilled-quantized LLaMA model achieved a 20\% increase in accuracy when trained on Text-to-SQL tasks, while Qwen achieved a 5\% increase. These results suggest that SQL can serve not only as a target formalism but also as an effective scaffold for learning robust, transferable reasoning over structured data.

  Knowledge distillation allows smaller neural networks to emulate the performance of larger, teacher models with reduced computational demands. Traditional methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often necessitate extensive fine-tuning, which limits their accessibility. To address this, we introduce Trace-of-Thought Prompting, a novel framework designed to distill critical reasoning capabilities from high-resource teacher models (over 8 billion parameters) to low-resource student models (up to 8 billion parameters). This approach leverages problem decomposition to enhance interpretability and facilitate human-in-the-loop interventions. Empirical evaluations on the GSM8K and MATH datasets show that student models achieve accuracy gains of up to 113% on GSM8K and 21% on MATH, with significant improvements particularly notable in smaller models like Llama 2 and Zephyr. Our results suggest a promising pathway for open-source, low-resource models to eventually serve both as both students and teachers, potentially reducing our reliance on high-resource, proprietary models.

  Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for medical applications and are evolving rapidly, with new models being released at an accelerated pace. However, current evaluations of LLMs in clinical contexts remain limited. Most existing benchmarks rely on medical exam-style questions or PubMed-derived text, failing to capture the complexity of real-world electronic health record (EHR) data. Others focus narrowly on specific application scenarios, limiting their generalizability across broader clinical use. To address this gap, we present BRIDGE, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 87 tasks sourced from real-world clinical data sources across nine languages. We systematically evaluated 52 state-of-the-art LLMs (including DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Llama 4) under various inference strategies. With a total of 13,572 experiments, our results reveal substantial performance variation across model sizes, languages, natural language processing tasks, and clinical specialties. Notably, we demonstrate that open-source LLMs can achieve performance comparable to proprietary models, while medically fine-tuned LLMs based on older architectures often underperform versus updated general-purpose models. The BRIDGE and its corresponding leaderboard serve as a foundational resource and a unique reference for the development and evaluation of new LLMs in real-world clinical text understanding.The BRIDGE leaderboard:this https URL

  The recent development of reasoning language models (RLMs) represents a novel evolution in large language models. In particular, the recent release of DeepSeek-R1 has generated widespread social impact and sparked enthusiasm in the research community for exploring the explicit reasoning paradigm of language models. However, the implementation details of the released models have not been fully open-sourced by DeepSeek, including DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and the distilled small models. As a result, many replication studies have emerged aiming to reproduce the strong performance achieved by DeepSeek-R1, reaching comparable performance through similar training procedures and fully open-source data resources. These works have investigated feasible strategies for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), focusing on data preparation and method design, yielding various valuable insights. In this report, we provide a summary of recent replication studies to inspire future research. We primarily focus on SFT and RLVR as two main directions, introducing the details for data construction, method design and training procedure of current replication studies. Moreover, we conclude key findings from the implementation details and experimental results reported by these studies, anticipating to inspire future research. We also discuss additional techniques of enhancing RLMs, highlighting the potential of expanding the application scope of these models, and discussing the challenges in development. By this survey, we aim to help researchers and developers of RLMs stay updated with the latest advancements, and seek to inspire new ideas to further enhance RLMs.

  This report aims to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in solving high school science questions and to explore their potential applications in the educational field. With the rapid development of LLMs in the field of natural language processing, their application in education has attracted widespread attention. This study selected mathematics exam questions from the college entrance examinations (2019-2023) as evaluation data and utilized at least eight LLM APIs to provide answers. A comprehensive assessment was conducted based on metrics such as accuracy, response time, logical reasoning, and creativity. Through an in-depth analysis of the evaluation results, this report reveals the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in handling high school science questions and discusses their implications for educational practice. The findings indicate that although LLMs perform excellently in certain aspects, there is still room for improvement in logical reasoning and creative problem-solving. This report provides an empirical foundation for further research and application of LLMs in the educational field and offers suggestions for improvement.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are primarily trained on high-resource natural languages, limiting their effectiveness in low-resource settings and in tasks requiring deep logical reasoning. This research introduces Rosetta-PL, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' logical reasoning and generalization capabilities in a controlled environment. We construct Rosetta-PL by translating a dataset of logical propositions from Lean into a custom logical language, which is then used to fine-tune an LLM (e.g., GPT-4o). Our experiments analyze the impact of the size of the dataset and the translation methodology on the performance of the model. Our results indicate that preserving logical relationships in the translation process significantly boosts precision, with accuracy plateauing beyond roughly 20,000 training samples. These insights provide valuable guidelines for optimizing LLM training in formal reasoning tasks and improving performance in various low-resource language applications.

  As large language models (LLMs) evolve into tool-using agents, the ability to browse the web in real-time has become a critical yardstick for measuring their reasoning and retrieval competence. Existing benchmarks such as BrowseComp concentrate on English and overlook the linguistic, infrastructural, and censorship-related complexities of other major information ecosystems -- most notably Chinese. To address this gap, we introduce BrowseComp-ZH, a high-difficulty benchmark purpose-built to comprehensively evaluate LLM agents on the Chinese web. BrowseComp-ZH consists of 289 multi-hop questions spanning 11 diverse domains. Each question is reverse-engineered from a short, objective, and easily verifiable answer (e.g., a date, number, or proper noun). A two-stage quality control protocol is applied to strive for high question difficulty and answer uniqueness. We benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art language models and agentic search systems on our proposed BrowseComp-ZH. Despite their strong conversational and retrieval capabilities, most models struggle severely: a large number achieve accuracy rates below 10%, and only a handful exceed 20%. Even the best-performing system, OpenAI's DeepResearch, reaches just 42.9%. These results demonstrate the considerable difficulty of BrowseComp-ZH, where success demands not only effective retrieval strategies, but also sophisticated reasoning and information reconciliation -- capabilities that current models still struggle to master. Our dataset, construction guidelines, and benchmark results have been publicly released atthis https URL.

  The composition of pre-training datasets for large language models (LLMs) remains largely undisclosed, hindering transparency and efforts to optimize data quality, a critical driver of model performance. Current data selection methods, such as natural language quality assessments, diversity-based filters, and classifier-based approaches, are limited by single-dimensional evaluation or redundancy-focused strategies. To address these gaps, we propose PRRC to evaluate data quality across Professionalism, Readability, Reasoning, and Cleanliness. We further introduce Meta-rater, a multi-dimensional data selection method that integrates these dimensions with existing quality metrics through learned optimal weightings. Meta-rater employs proxy models to train a regression model that predicts validation loss, enabling the identification of optimal combinations of quality scores. Experiments demonstrate that Meta-rater doubles convergence speed for 1.3B parameter models and improves downstream task performance by 3.23, with scalable benefits observed in 3.3B models trained on 100B tokens. Additionally, we release the annotated SlimPajama-627B dataset, labeled across 25 quality metrics (including PRRC), to advance research in data-centric LLM development. Our work establishes that holistic, multi-dimensional quality integration significantly outperforms conventional single-dimension approaches, offering a scalable paradigm for enhancing pre-training efficiency and model capability.

  Large language models (LLMs) play a key role in generating evidence-based and stylistic counter-arguments, yet their effectiveness in real-world applications has been underexplored. Previous research often neglects the balance between evidentiality and style, which are crucial for persuasive arguments. To address this, we evaluated the effectiveness of stylized evidence-based counter-argument generation in Counterfire, a new dataset of 38,000 counter-arguments generated by revising counter-arguments to Reddit's ChangeMyView community to follow different discursive styles. We evaluated generic and stylized counter-arguments from basic and fine-tuned models such as GPT-3.5, PaLM-2, and Koala-13B, as well as newer models (GPT-4o, Claude Haiku, LLaMA-3.1) focusing on rhetorical quality and persuasiveness. Our findings reveal that humans prefer stylized counter-arguments over the original outputs, with GPT-3.5 Turbo performing well, though still not reaching human standards of rhetorical quality nor persuasiveness. Additionally, our work created a novel argument triplets dataset for studying style control, with human preference labels that provide insights into the tradeoffs between evidence integration and argument quality.
