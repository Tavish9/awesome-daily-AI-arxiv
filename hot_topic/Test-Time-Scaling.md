- **[SmartWay: Enhanced Waypoint Prediction and Backtracking for Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10069)**  `arXiv:2503.10069`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in continuous environments requires agents to interpret natural language instructions while navigating unconstrained 3D spaces. Existing VLN-CE frameworks rely on a two-stage approach: a waypoint predictor to generate waypoints and a navigator to execute movements. However, current waypoint predictors struggle with spatial awareness, while navigators lack historical reasoning and backtracking capabilities, limiting adaptability. We propose a zero-shot VLN-CE framework integrating an enhanced waypoint predictor with a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based navigator. Our predictor employs a stronger vision encoder, masked cross-attention fusion, and an occupancy-aware loss for better waypoint quality. The navigator incorporates history-aware reasoning and adaptive path planning with backtracking, improving robustness. Experiments on R2R-CE and MP3D benchmarks show our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in zero-shot settings, demonstrating competitive results compared to fully supervised methods. Real-world validation on Turtlebot 4 further highlights its adaptability.

- **[Casper: Inferring Diverse Intents for Assistive Teleoperation with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14727)**  `arXiv:2506.14727`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Assistive teleoperation, where control is shared between a human and a robot, enables efficient and intuitive human-robot collaboration in diverse and unstructured environments. A central challenge in real-world assistive teleoperation is for the robot to infer a wide range of human intentions from user control inputs and to assist users with correct actions. Existing methods are either confined to simple, predefined scenarios or restricted to task-specific data distributions at training, limiting their support for real-world assistance. We introduce Casper, an assistive teleoperation system that leverages commonsense knowledge embedded in pre-trained visual language models (VLMs) for real-time intent inference and flexible skill execution. Casper incorporates an open-world perception module for a generalized understanding of novel objects and scenes, a VLM-powered intent inference mechanism that leverages commonsense reasoning to interpret snippets of teleoperated user input, and a skill library that expands the scope of prior assistive teleoperation systems to support diverse, long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive empirical evaluation, including human studies and system ablations, demonstrates that Casper improves task performance, reduces human cognitive load, and achieves higher user satisfaction than direct teleoperation and assistive teleoperation baselines.

- **[NetRoller: Interfacing General and Specialized Models for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14589)**  `arXiv:2506.14589`  `cs.RO`  
  _Ren Xin, Hongji Liu, Xiaodong Mei, Wenru Liu, Maosheng Ye, Zhili Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Integrating General Models (GMs) such as Large Language Models (LLMs), with Specialized Models (SMs) in autonomous driving tasks presents a promising approach to mitigating challenges in data diversity and model capacity of existing specialized driving models. However, this integration leads to problems of asynchronous systems, which arise from the distinct characteristics inherent in GMs and SMs. To tackle this challenge, we propose NetRoller, an adapter that incorporates a set of novel mechanisms to facilitate the seamless integration of GMs and specialized driving models. Specifically, our mechanisms for interfacing the asynchronous GMs and SMs are organized into three key stages. NetRoller first harvests semantically rich and computationally efficient representations from the reasoning processes of LLMs using an early stopping mechanism, which preserves critical insights on driving context while maintaining low overhead. It then applies learnable query embeddings, nonsensical embeddings, and positional layer embeddings to facilitate robust and efficient cross-modality translation. At last, it employs computationally efficient Query Shift and Feature Shift mechanisms to enhance the performance of SMs through few-epoch fine-tuning. Based on the mechanisms formalized in these three stages, NetRoller enables specialized driving models to operate at their native frequencies while maintaining situational awareness of the GM. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating GM through NetRoller significantly improves human similarity and safety in planning tasks, and it also achieves noticeable precision improvements in detection and mapping tasks for end-to-end autonomous driving.

- **[Can Pretrained Vision-Language Embeddings Alone Guide Robot Navigation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14507)**  `arXiv:2506.14507`  `cs.RO`  
  _Nitesh Subedi, Adam Haroon, Shreyan Ganguly, Samuel T.K. Tetteh, Prajwal Koirala, Cody Fleming, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models have revolutionized robotics by providing rich semantic representations without task-specific training. While many approaches integrate pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) with specialized navigation architectures, the fundamental question remains: can these pretrained embeddings alone successfully guide navigation without additional fine-tuning or specialized modules? We present a minimalist framework that decouples this question by training a behavior cloning policy directly on frozen vision-language embeddings from demonstrations collected by a privileged expert. Our approach achieves a 74% success rate in navigation to language-specified targets, compared to 100% for the state-aware expert, though requiring 3.2 times more steps on average. This performance gap reveals that pretrained embeddings effectively support basic language grounding but struggle with long-horizon planning and spatial reasoning. By providing this empirical baseline, we highlight both the capabilities and limitations of using foundation models as drop-in representations for embodied tasks, offering critical insights for robotics researchers facing practical design tradeoffs between system complexity and performance in resource-constrained scenarios.

- **[Narrate2Nav: Real-Time Visual Navigation with Implicit Language Reasoning in Human-Centric Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14233)**  `arXiv:2506.14233`  `cs.RO`  
  _Amirreza Payandeh, Anuj Pokhrel, Daeun Song, Marcos Zampieri, Xuesu Xiao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated potential in enhancing mobile robot navigation in human-centric environments by understanding contextual cues, human intentions, and social dynamics while exhibiting reasoning capabilities. However, their computational complexity and limited sensitivity to continuous numerical data impede real-time performance and precise motion control. To this end, we propose Narrate2Nav, a novel real-time vision-action model that leverages a novel self-supervised learning framework based on the Barlow Twins redundancy reduction loss to embed implicit natural language reasoning, social cues, and human intentions within a visual encoder-enabling reasoning in the model's latent space rather than token space. The model combines RGB inputs, motion commands, and textual signals of scene context during training to bridge from robot observations to low-level motion commands for short-horizon point-goal navigation during deployment. Extensive evaluation of Narrate2Nav across various challenging scenarios in both offline unseen dataset and real-world experiments demonstrates an overall improvement of 52.94 percent and 41.67 percent, respectively, over the next best baseline. Additionally, qualitative comparative analysis of Narrate2Nav's visual encoder attention map against four other baselines demonstrates enhanced attention to navigation-critical scene elements, underscoring its effectiveness in human-centric navigation tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study investigates router-based multi-agent systems for automating foundation design calculations through intelligent task classification and expert selection. Three approaches were evaluated: single-agent processing, multi-agent designer-checker architecture, and router-based expert selection. Performance assessment utilized baseline models including DeepSeek R1, ChatGPT 4 Turbo, Grok 3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across shallow foundation and pile design scenarios. The router-based configuration achieved performance scores of 95.00% for shallow foundations and 90.63% for pile design, representing improvements of 8.75 and 3.13 percentage points over standalone Grok 3 performance respectively. The system outperformed conventional agentic workflows by 10.0 to 43.75 percentage points. Grok 3 demonstrated superior standalone performance without external computational tools, indicating advances in direct LLM mathematical reasoning for engineering applications. The dual-tier classification framework successfully distinguished foundation types, enabling appropriate analytical approaches. Results establish router-based multi-agent systems as optimal for foundation design automation while maintaining professional documentation standards. Given safety-critical requirements in civil engineering, continued human oversight remains essential, positioning these systems as advanced computational assistance tools rather than autonomous design replacements in professional practice.

- **[Sketch-Plan-Generalize: Learning and Planning with Neuro-Symbolic Programmatic Representations for Inductive Spatial Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07774)**  `arXiv:2404.07774`  `cs.LG` `cs.RO`  
  _Namasivayam Kalithasan, Sachit Sachdeva, Himanshu Gaurav Singh, Vishal Bindal, Arnav Tuli, Gurarmaan Singh Panjeta, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective human-robot collaboration requires the ability to learn personalized concepts from a limited number of demonstrations, while exhibiting inductive generalization, hierarchical composition, and adaptability to novel constraints. Existing approaches that use code generation capabilities of pre-trained large (vision) language models as well as purely neural models show poor generalization to \emph{a-priori} unseen complex concepts. Neuro-symbolic methods (Grand et al., 2023) offer a promising alternative by searching in program space, but face challenges in large program spaces due to the inability to effectively guide the search using demonstrations. Our key insight is to factor inductive concept learning as: (i) {\it Sketch:} detecting and inferring a coarse signature of a new concept (ii) {\it Plan:} performing an MCTS search over grounded action sequences guided by human demonstrations (iii) {\it Generalize:} abstracting out grounded plans as inductive programs. Our pipeline facilitates generalization and modular re-use, enabling continual concept learning. Our approach combines the benefits of code generation ability of large language models (LLMs) along with grounded neural representations, resulting in neuro-symbolic programs that show stronger inductive generalization on the task of constructing complex structures vis-√°-vis LLM-only and purely neural approaches. Further, we demonstrate reasoning and planning capabilities with learned concepts for embodied instruction following.

  Recent innovations in multimodal action models represent a promising direction for developing general-purpose agentic systems, combining visual understanding, language comprehension, and action generation. We introduce MultiNet - a novel, fully open-source benchmark and surrounding software ecosystem designed to rigorously evaluate and adapt models across vision, language, and action domains. We establish standardized evaluation protocols for assessing vision-language models (VLMs) and vision-language-action models (VLAs), and provide open source software to download relevant data, models, and evaluations. Additionally, we provide a composite dataset with over 1.3 trillion tokens of image captioning, visual question answering, commonsense reasoning, robotic control, digital game-play, simulated locomotion/manipulation, and many more tasks. The MultiNet benchmark, framework, toolkit, and evaluation harness have been used in downstream research on the limitations of VLA generalization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a challenging benchmark for the Open WorLd VISual question answering (OWLViz) task. OWLViz presents concise, unambiguous queries that require integrating multiple capabilities, including visual understanding, web exploration, and specialized tool usage. While humans achieve 69.2% accuracy on these intuitive tasks, even state-of-the-art VLMs struggle, with the best model, Gemini 2.0, achieving only 26.6% accuracy. Current agentic VLMs, which rely on limited vision and vision-language models as tools, perform even worse. This performance gap reveals significant limitations in multimodal systems' ability to select appropriate tools and execute complex reasoning sequences, establishing new directions for advancing practical AI research.

  Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 20.7% over supervised fine-tuning baselines.

  Large language model (LLM) driven synthetic data generation has emerged as a powerful method for improving model reasoning capabilities. However, most methods either distill large state-of-the-art models into small students or use natural ground-truth problem statements to guarantee problem statement quality. This limits the scalability of these approaches to more complex and diverse problem domains. To address this, we present SPARQ: Synthetic Problem Generation for Reasoning via Quality-Diversity Algorithms, a novel approach for generating high-quality and diverse synthetic math problem and solution pairs using only a single model by measuring a problem's solve-rate: a proxy for problem difficulty. Starting from a seed dataset of 7.5K samples, we generate over 20 million new problem-solution pairs. We show that filtering the generated data by difficulty and then fine-tuning the same model on the resulting data improves relative model performance by up to 24\%. Additionally, we conduct ablations studying the impact of synthetic data quantity, quality and diversity on model generalization. We find that higher quality, as measured by problem difficulty, facilitates better in-distribution performance. Further, while generating diverse synthetic data does not as strongly benefit in-distribution performance, filtering for more diverse data facilitates more robust OOD generalization. We also confirm the existence of model and data scaling laws for synthetically generated problems, which positively benefit downstream model generalization.

- **[NAROCE: A Neural Algorithmic Reasoner Framework for Online Complex Event Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07250)**  `arXiv:2502.07250`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern machine learning models excel at detecting individual actions, objects, or scene attributes from short, local observations. However, many real-world tasks, such as in smart cities and healthcare, require reasoning over complex events (CEs): (spatio)temporal, rule-governed patterns of short-term atomic events (AEs) that reflect high-level understanding and critical changes in the environment. These CEs are difficult to detect online: they are often rare, require long-range reasoning over noisy sensor data, must generalize rules beyond fixed-length traces, and suffer from limited real-world datasets due to the high annotation burden. We propose NAROCE, a Neural Algorithmic Reasoning framework for Online CE detection that separates the task into two stages: (i) learning CE rules from large-scale, low-cost pseudo AE concept traces generated by simulators or LLMs, and (ii) training an adapter to map real sensor data into the learned reasoning space using fewer labeled sensor samples. Experiments show that NAROCE outperforms the strongest baseline in accuracy, generalization to longer, unseen sequences, and data efficiency, achieving comparable performance with less than half the labeled data. These results suggest that decoupling CE rule learning from raw sensor inputs improves both data efficiency and robustness.

  _Yeonju Ro, Zhenyu Zhang, Souvik Kundu, Zhangyang Wang, Aditya Akella_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) excel at capturing global token dependencies via self-attention but face prohibitive compute and memory costs on lengthy inputs. While sub-quadratic methods (e.g., linear attention) can reduce these costs, they often degrade accuracy due to overemphasizing recent tokens. In this work, we first propose dual-state linear attention (DSLA), a novel design that maintains two specialized hidden states-one for preserving historical context and one for tracking recency-thereby mitigating the short-range bias typical of linear-attention architectures. To further balance efficiency and accuracy under dynamic workload conditions, we introduce DSLA-Serve, an online adaptive distillation framework that progressively replaces Transformer layers with DSLA layers at inference time, guided by a sensitivity-based layer ordering. DSLA-Serve uses a chained fine-tuning strategy to ensure that each newly converted DSLA layer remains consistent with previously replaced layers, preserving the overall quality. Extensive evaluations on commonsense reasoning, long-context QA, and text summarization demonstrate that DSLA-Serve yields 2.3x faster inference than Llama2-7B and 3.0x faster than the hybrid Zamba-7B, while retaining comparable performance across downstream tasks. Our ablation studies show that DSLA's dual states capture both global and local dependencies, addressing the historical-token underrepresentation seen in prior linear attentions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Codes and data will be available later (under review).Keywords: reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), instruction following, complex instructions

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in multimodal understanding, yet their capabilities for scientific reasoning remain inadequately assessed. Current multimodal benchmarks predominantly evaluate generic image comprehension or text-driven reasoning, lacking authentic scientific contexts that require domain-specific knowledge integration with visual evidence analysis. To fill this gap, we present CSVQA, a diagnostic multimodal benchmark specifically designed for evaluating scientific reasoning through domain-grounded visual question answering. Our benchmark features 1,378 carefully constructed question-answer pairs spanning diverse STEM disciplines, each demanding domain knowledge, integration of visual evidence, and higher-order reasoning. Compared to prior multimodal benchmarks, CSVQA places greater emphasis on real-world scientific content and complex reasoning. We additionally propose a rigorous evaluation protocol to systematically assess whether model predictions are substantiated by valid intermediate reasoning steps based on curated explanations. Our comprehensive evaluation of 15 VLMs on this benchmark reveals notable performance disparities, as even the top-ranked proprietary model attains only 49.6% accuracy. This empirical evidence underscores the pressing need for advancing scientific reasoning capabilities in VLMs. Our CSVQA is released atthis https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled broad progress in the general medical field. However, pathology still remains a more challenging subdomain, with current pathology specific VLMs exhibiting limitations in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning plausibility. Such shortcomings are largely attributable to the nature of current pathology datasets, which are primarily composed of image description pairs that lack the depth and structured diagnostic paradigms employed by real world pathologists. In this study, we leverage pathology textbooks and real world pathology experts to construct high-quality, reasoning-oriented datasets. Building on this, we introduce Patho-R1, a multimodal RL-based pathology Reasoner, trained through a three-stage pipeline: (1) continued pretraining on 3.5 million image-text pairs for knowledge infusion; (2) supervised fine-tuning on 500k high-quality Chain-of-Thought samples for reasoning incentivizing; (3) reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization and Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization strategies for multimodal reasoning quality refinement. To further assess the alignment quality of our dataset, we propose Patho-CLIP, trained on the same figure-caption corpus used for continued pretraining. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that both Patho-CLIP and Patho-R1 achieve robust performance across a wide range of pathology-related tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, Visual Question Answering, and Multiple Choice Question.

- **[Recognition through Reasoning: Reinforcing Image Geo-localization with Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14674)**  `arXiv:2506.14674`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ling Li, Yao Zhou, Yuxuan Liang, Fugee Tsung, Jiaheng Wei_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Previous methods for image geo-localization have typically treated the task as either classification or retrieval, often relying on black-box decisions that lack interpretability. The rise of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has enabled a rethinking of geo-localization as a reasoning-driven task grounded in visual cues. However, two major challenges persist. On the data side, existing reasoning-focused datasets are primarily based on street-view imagery, offering limited scene diversity and constrained viewpoints. On the modeling side, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning, which yields only marginal improvements in reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pipeline that constructs a reasoning-oriented geo-localization dataset, MP16-Reason, using diverse social media images. We introduce GLOBE, Group-relative policy optimization for Locatability assessment and Optimized visual-clue reasoning, yielding Bi-objective geo-Enhancement for the VLM in recognition and reasoning. GLOBE incorporates task-specific rewards that jointly enhance locatability assessment, visual clue reasoning, and geolocation accuracy. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that GLOBE outperforms state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on geo-localization tasks, particularly in diverse visual scenes, while also generating more insightful and interpretable reasoning trajectories.

- **[SIRI-Bench: Challenging VLMs' Spatial Intelligence through Complex Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14512)**  `arXiv:2506.14512`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zijian Song, Xiaoxin Lin, Qiuming Huang, Guangrun Wang, Liang Lin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are experiencing rapid advancements in complex reasoning, exhibiting remarkable generalization in mathematics and programming. In contrast, while spatial intelligence is fundamental for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world interaction, the systematic evaluation of their complex reasoning ability within spatial contexts remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SIRI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' spatial intelligence through video-based reasoning tasks. SIRI-Bench comprises nearly 1K video-question-answer triplets, where each problem is embedded in a realistic 3D scene and captured by video. By carefully designing questions and corresponding 3D scenes, our benchmark ensures that solving the questions requires both spatial comprehension for extracting information and high-level reasoning for deriving solutions, making it a challenging benchmark for evaluating VLMs. To facilitate large-scale data synthesis, we develop an Automatic Scene Creation Engine. This engine, leveraging multiple specialized LLM agents, can generate realistic 3D scenes from abstract math problems, ensuring faithfulness to the original descriptions. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle significantly on SIRI-Bench, underscoring the challenge of spatial reasoning. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to spatially grounded reasoning and advance VLMs in visual problem-solving.

  _Xiang Cheng, Chengyan Pan, Minjun Zhao, Deyang Li, Fangchao Liu, Xinyu Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-Context Learning (ICL) is an essential emergent ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), and recent studies introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to exemplars of ICL to enhance the reasoning capability, especially in mathematics tasks. However, given the continuous advancement of model capabilities, it remains unclear whether CoT exemplars still benefit recent, stronger models in such tasks. Through systematic experiments, we find that for recent strong models such as the Qwen2.5 series, adding traditional CoT exemplars does not improve reasoning performance compared to Zero-Shot CoT. Instead, their primary function is to align the output format with human expectations. We further investigate the effectiveness of enhanced CoT exemplars, constructed using answers from advanced models such as \texttt{Qwen2.5-Max} and \texttt{DeepSeek-R1}. Experimental results indicate that these enhanced exemplars still fail to improve the model's reasoning performance. Further analysis reveals that models tend to ignore the exemplars and focus primarily on the instructions, leading to no observable gain in reasoning ability. Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of the current ICL+CoT framework in mathematical reasoning, calling for a re-examination of the ICL paradigm and the definition of exemplars.

- **[LongSpec: Long-Context Lossless Speculative Decoding with Efficient Drafting and Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17421)**  `arXiv:2502.17421`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Penghui Yang, Cunxiao Du, Fengzhuo Zhang, Haonan Wang, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) can now process extremely long contexts, efficient inference over these extended inputs has become increasingly important, especially for emerging applications like LLM agents that highly depend on this capability. Speculative decoding (SD) offers a promising lossless acceleration technique compared to lossy alternatives such as quantization and model cascades. However, most state-of-the-art SD methods are trained on short texts (typically fewer than 4k tokens), making them unsuitable for long-context scenarios. Specifically, adapting these methods to long contexts presents three key challenges: (1) the excessive memory demands posed by draft models due to large Key-Value (KV) cache; (2) performance degradation resulting from the mismatch between short-context training and long-context inference; and (3) inefficiencies in tree attention mechanisms when managing long token sequences. This work introduces LongSpec, a framework that addresses these challenges through three core innovations: a memory-efficient draft model with a constant-sized KV cache; novel position indices that mitigate the training-inference mismatch; and an attention aggregation strategy that combines fast prefix computation with standard tree attention to enable efficient decoding. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LongSpec, achieving up to a 3.26x speedup over strong Flash Attention baselines across five long-context understanding datasets, as well as a 2.25x reduction in wall-clock time on the AIME24 long reasoning task with the QwQ model, demonstrating significant latency improvements for long-context applications.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, trained on huge amount of datasets spanning multiple domains, exhibit significant reasoning, understanding, and planning capabilities across various tasks. This study presents the first-ever work in Arabic language integration within the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) domain in robotics, an area that has been notably underexplored in existing research. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art multi-lingual Small Language Models (SLMs), including GPT-4o mini, Llama 3 8B, and Phi-3 medium 14B, alongside the Arabic-centric LLM, Jais. Our approach utilizes the NavGPT framework, a pure LLM-based instruction-following navigation agent, to assess the impact of language on navigation reasoning through zero-shot sequential action prediction using the R2R dataset. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of high-level planning for navigation tasks when provided with instructions in both English and Arabic. However, certain models struggled with reasoning and planning in the Arabic language due to inherent limitations in their capabilities, sub-optimal performance, and parsing issues. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing planning and reasoning capabilities in language models for effective navigation, emphasizing this as a key area for further development while also unlocking the potential of Arabic-language models for impactful real-world applications.

  We present Ring-lite, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language model optimized via reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and robust reasoning capabilities. Built upon the publicly available Ling-lite model, a 16.8 billion parameter model with 2.75 billion activated parameters, our approach matches the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) small-scale reasoning models on challenging benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench, GPQA-Diamond) while activating only one-third of the parameters required by comparable models. To accomplish this, we introduce a joint training pipeline integrating distillation with RL, revealing undocumented challenges in MoE RL training. First, we identify optimization instability during RL training, and we propose Constrained Contextual Computation Policy Optimization(C3PO), a novel approach that enhances training stability and improves computational throughput via algorithm-system co-design methodology. Second, we empirically demonstrate that selecting distillation checkpoints based on entropy loss for RL training, rather than validation metrics, yields superior performance-efficiency trade-offs in subsequent RL training. Finally, we develop a two-stage training paradigm to harmonize multi-domain data integration, addressing domain conflicts that arise in training with mixed dataset. We will release the model, dataset, and code.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive moral reasoning abilities. Yet they often diverge when confronted with complex, multi-factor moral dilemmas. To address these discrepancies, we propose a framework that synthesizes multiple LLMs' moral judgments into a collectively formulated moral judgment, realigning models that deviate significantly from this consensus. Our aggregation mechanism fuses continuous moral acceptability scores (beyond binary labels) into a collective probability, weighting contributions by model reliability. For misaligned models, a targeted embedding-optimization procedure fine-tunes token embeddings for moral philosophical theories, minimizing JS divergence to the consensus while preserving semantic integrity. Experiments on a large-scale social moral dilemma dataset show our approach builds robust consensus and improves individual model fidelity. These findings highlight the value of data-driven moral alignment across multiple models and its potential for safer, more consistent AI systems.

  Large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance, yet struggle with complex tasks such as numerical reasoning, plan generation. Integrating external tools, such as calculators and databases, into large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing problem-solving capabilities. Current methods assign a unique token to each tool, enabling LLMs to call tools through token prediction-similar to word generation. However, this approach fails to account for the relationship between tool and word tokens, limiting adaptability within pre-trained LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel token learning method that aligns tool tokens with the existing word embedding space from the perspective of initialization, thereby enhancing model performance. We begin by constructing prior token embeddings for each tool based on the tool's name or description, which are used to initialize and regularize the learnable tool token embeddings. This ensures the learned embeddings are well-aligned with the word token space, improving tool call accuracy. We evaluate the method on tasks such as numerical reasoning, knowledge-based question answering, and embodied plan generation using GSM8K-XL, FuncQA, KAMEL, and VirtualHome datasets. The results demonstrate clear improvements over recent baselines, including CoT, REACT, ICL, and ToolkenGPT, indicating that our approach effectively augments LLMs with tools through relevant tokens across diverse domains.

  Despite impressive progress on complex reasoning, current large language models (LLMs) typically operate in isolation - treating each problem as an independent attempt, without accumulating or integrating experiential knowledge. In contrast, expert problem solvers - such as Olympiad or programming contest teams - leverage a rich tapestry of experiences: absorbing mentorship from coaches, developing intuition from past problems, leveraging knowledge of tool usage and library functionality, adapting strategies based on the expertise and experiences of peers, continuously refining their reasoning through trial and error, and learning from other related problems even during competition. We introduce Xolver, a training-free multi-agent reasoning framework that equips a black-box LLM with a persistent, evolving memory of holistic experience. Xolver integrates diverse experience modalities, including external and self-retrieval, tool use, collaborative interactions, agent-driven evaluation, and iterative refinement. By learning from relevant strategies, code fragments, and abstract reasoning patterns at inference time, Xolver avoids generating solutions from scratch - marking a transition from isolated inference toward experience-aware language agents. Built on both open-weight and proprietary models, Xolver consistently outperforms specialized reasoning agents. Even with lightweight backbones (e.g., QWQ-32B), it often surpasses advanced models including Qwen3-235B, Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3, and o4-mini-high. With o3-mini-high, it achieves new best results on GSM8K (98.1%), AIME'24 (94.4%), AIME'25 (93.7%), Math-500 (99.8%), and LiveCodeBench-V5 (91.6%) - highlighting holistic experience learning as a key step toward generalist agents capable of expert-level reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse downstream tasks. However, their autoregressive nature leads to substantial inference latency, posing challenges for real-time applications. Speculative sampling mitigates this issue by introducing a drafting phase followed by a parallel validation phase, enabling faster token generation and verification. Existing approaches, however, overlook the inherent coherence in text generation, limiting their efficiency. To address this gap, we propose a Speculative Sampling with Syntactic and Semantic Coherence (S$^4$C) framework, which extends speculative sampling by leveraging multi-head drafting for rapid token generation and a continuous verification tree for efficient candidate validation and feature reuse. Experimental results demonstrate that S$^4$C surpasses baseline methods across mainstream tasks, offering enhanced efficiency, parallelism, and the ability to generate more valid tokens with fewer computational resources. On Spec-bench benchmarks, S$^4$C achieves an acceleration ratio of 2.26x-2.60x, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

  Across languages, numeral systems vary widely in how they construct and combine numbers. While humans consistently learn to navigate this diversity, large language models (LLMs) struggle with linguistic-mathematical puzzles involving cross-linguistic numeral systems, which humans can learn to solve successfully. We investigate why this task is difficult for LLMs through a series of experiments that untangle the linguistic and mathematical aspects of numbers in language. Our experiments establish that models cannot consistently solve such problems unless the mathematical operations in the problems are explicitly marked using known symbols ($+$, $\times$, etc, as in "twenty + three"). In further ablation studies, we probe how individual parameters of numeral construction and combination affect performance. While humans use their linguistic understanding of numbers to make inferences about the implicit compositional structure of numerals, LLMs seem to lack this notion of implicit numeral structure. We conclude that the ability to flexibly infer compositional rules from implicit patterns in human-scale data remains an open challenge for current reasoning models.

  We present and evaluate a suite of proof-of-concept (PoC), structured workflow prompts designed to elicit human-like hierarchical reasoning while guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) in the high-level semantic and linguistic analysis of scholarly manuscripts. The prompts target two non-trivial analytical tasks within academic summaries (abstracts and conclusions): identifying unsubstantiated claims (informational integrity) and flagging semantically confusing ambiguous pronoun references (linguistic clarity). We conducted a systematic, multi-run evaluation on two frontier models (Gemini Pro 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3) under varied context conditions. Our results for the informational integrity task reveal a significant divergence in model performance: while both models successfully identified an unsubstantiated head of a noun phrase (95% success), ChatGPT consistently failed (0% success) to identify an unsubstantiated adjectival modifier that Gemini correctly flagged (95% success), raising a question regarding the potential influence of the target's syntactic role. For the linguistic analysis task, both models performed well (80-90% success) with full manuscript context. Surprisingly, in a summary-only setting, Gemini's performance was substantially degraded, while ChatGPT achieved a perfect (100%) success rate. Our findings suggest that while structured prompting is a viable methodology for complex textual analysis, prompt performance may be highly dependent on the interplay between the model, task type, and context, highlighting the need for rigorous, model-specific testing.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As language agents increasingly automate critical tasks, their ability to follow domain-specific standard operating procedures (SOPs), policies, and constraints when taking actions and making tool calls becomes essential yet remains underexplored. To address this gap, we develop an automated evaluation pipeline SOPBench with: (1) executable environments containing 167 tools/functions across seven customer service domains with service-specific SOPs and rule-based verifiers, (2) an automated test generation framework producing over 900 verified test cases, and (3) an automated evaluation framework to rigorously assess agent adherence from multiple dimensions. Our approach transforms each service-specific SOP code program into a directed graph of executable functions and requires agents to call these functions based on natural language SOP descriptions. The original code serves as oracle rule-based verifiers to assess compliance, reducing reliance on manual annotations and LLM-based evaluations. We evaluate 18 leading models, and results show the task is challenging even for top-tier models (like GPT-4o, Claude-3.7-Sonnet), with variances across domains. Reasoning models like o4-mini-high show superiority while other powerful models perform less effectively (pass rates of 30%-50%), and small models (7B, 8B) perform significantly worse. Additionally, language agents can be easily jailbroken to overlook SOPs and constraints. Code, data, and over 24k agent trajectories are released atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the advanced capabilities of large language models (LLMs), their temporal reasoning ability remains underdeveloped. Prior works have highlighted this limitation, particularly in maintaining temporal consistency when understanding events. For example, models often confuse mutually exclusive temporal relations like ``before'' and ``after'' between events and make inconsistent predictions. In this work, we tackle the issue of temporal inconsistency in LLMs by proposing a novel counterfactual prompting approach. Our method generates counterfactual questions and enforces collective constraints, enhancing the model's consistency. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in event ordering for explicit and implicit events and temporal commonsense understanding by effectively addressing temporal inconsistencies.

  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a critical step in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human instructions and values, yet many aspects of SFT remain poorly understood. We trained a wide range of base models on a variety of datasets including code generation, mathematical reasoning, and general-domain tasks, resulting in 1,000+ SFT models under controlled conditions. We then identified the dataset properties that matter most and examined the layer-wise modifications introduced by SFT. Our findings reveal that some training-task synergies persist across all models while others vary substantially, emphasizing the importance of model-specific strategies. Moreover, we demonstrate that perplexity consistently predicts SFT effectiveness--often surpassing superficial similarity between trained data and benchmark--and that mid-layer weight changes correlate most strongly with performance gains. We will release these 1,000+ SFT models and benchmark results to accelerate further research.

  This paper introduces a novel neural network framework called M2BeamLLM for beam prediction in millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multi-input multi-output (mMIMO) communication systems. M2BeamLLM integrates multi-modal sensor data, including images, radar, LiDAR, and GPS, leveraging the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-2 for beam prediction. By combining sensing data encoding, multimodal alignment and fusion, and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), M2BeamLLM achieves significantly higher beam prediction accuracy and robustness, demonstrably outperforming traditional deep learning (DL) models in both standard and few-shot scenarios. Furthermore, its prediction performance consistently improves with increased diversity in sensing modalities. Our study provides an efficient and intelligent beam prediction solution for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) mmWave communication systems.

  As evaluation designs of large language models may shape our trajectory toward artificial general intelligence, comprehensive and forward-looking assessment is essential. Existing benchmarks primarily assess static knowledge, while intelligence also entails the ability to rapidly learn from experience. To this end, we advocate for the evaluation of Test-time Learning, the capacity to improve performance in experience-based, reasoning-intensive tasks during test time. In this work, we propose semantic games as effective testbeds for evaluating test-time learning, due to their resistance to saturation and inherent demand for strategic reasoning. We introduce an objective evaluation framework that compares model performance under both limited and cumulative experience settings, and contains four forms of experience representation. To provide a comparative baseline, we recruit eight human participants to complete the same task. Results show that LLMs exhibit measurable test-time learning capabilities; however, their improvements are less stable under cumulative experience and progress more slowly than those observed in humans. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs as general-purpose learning machines, while also revealing a substantial intellectual gap between models and humans, irrespective of how well LLMs perform on static benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Theory of Mind (ToM) in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to their capacity for reasoning about mental states, yet failures in this capacity often manifest as systematic implicit bias. Evaluating this bias is challenging, as conventional direct-query methods are susceptible to social desirability effects and fail to capture its subtle, multi-dimensional nature. To this end, we propose an evaluation framework that leverages the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) to reconceptualize bias as a multi-dimensional failure in ToM across Competence, Sociability, and Morality. The framework introduces two indirect tasks: the Word Association Bias Test (WABT) to assess implicit lexical associations and the Affective Attribution Test (AAT) to measure covert affective leanings, both designed to probe latent stereotypes without triggering model avoidance. Extensive experiments on 8 State-of-the-Art LLMs demonstrate our framework's capacity to reveal complex bias structures, including pervasive sociability bias, multi-dimensional divergence, and asymmetric stereotype amplification, thereby providing a more robust methodology for identifying the structural nature of implicit bias.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress in financial NLP and applications, yet existing benchmarks remain limited to monolingual and unimodal settings, often over-relying on simple tasks and failing to reflect the complexity of real-world financial communication. We introduce MultiFinBen, the first multilingual and multimodal benchmark tailored to the global financial domain, evaluating LLMs across modalities (text, vision, audio) and linguistic settings (monolingual, bilingual, multilingual) on domain-specific tasks. We introduce two novel tasks, including PolyFiQA-Easy and PolyFiQA-Expert, the first multilingual financial benchmarks requiring models to perform complex reasoning over mixed-language inputs; and EnglishOCR and SpanishOCR, the first OCR-embedded financial QA tasks challenging models to extract and reason over information from visual-text financial documents. Moreover, we propose a dynamic, difficulty-aware selection mechanism and curate a compact, balanced benchmark rather than simple aggregation existing datasets. Extensive evaluation of 22 state-of-the-art models reveals that even the strongest models, despite their general multimodal and multilingual capabilities, struggle dramatically when faced with complex cross-lingual and multimodal tasks in financial domain. MultiFinBen is publicly released to foster transparent, reproducible, and inclusive progress in financial studies and applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Code-switching (CSW) is the act of alternating between two or more languages within a single discourse. This phenomenon is widespread in multilingual communities, and increasingly prevalent in online content, where users naturally mix languages in everyday communication. As a result, Large Language Models (LLMs), now central to content processing and generation, are frequently exposed to code-switched inputs. Given their widespread use, it is crucial to understand how LLMs process and reason about such mixed-language text. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of LLM comprehension under code-switching by generating CSW variants of established reasoning and comprehension benchmarks. While degradation is evident when foreign tokens disrupt English text$\unicode{x2013}$even under linguistic constraints$\unicode{x2013}$embedding English into other languages often improves comprehension. Though prompting yields mixed results, fine-tuning offers a more stable path to degradation mitigation.

  We develop a task-oriented spoken dialogue system (SDS) that regulates emotional speech based on contextual cues to enable more empathetic news conversations. Despite advancements in emotional text-to-speech (TTS) techniques, task-oriented emotional SDSs remain underexplored due to the compartmentalized nature of SDS and emotional TTS research, as well as the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for social goals. We address these challenges by developing an emotional SDS for news conversations that utilizes a large language model (LLM)-based sentiment analyzer to identify appropriate emotions and PromptTTS to synthesize context-appropriate emotional speech. We also propose subjective evaluation scale for emotional SDSs and judge the emotion regulation performance of the proposed and baseline systems. Experiments showed that our emotional SDS outperformed a baseline system in terms of the emotion regulation and engagement. These results suggest the critical role of speech emotion for more engaging conversations. All our source code is open-sourced atthis https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit advanced reasoning yet still generate incorrect answers. We hypothesize that such errors frequently stem from spurious beliefs, propositions the model internally considers true but are incorrect. To address this, we propose a method to rectify the belief space by suppressing these spurious beliefs while simultaneously enhancing true ones, thereby enabling more reliable inferences. Our approach first identifies the beliefs that lead to incorrect or correct answers by prompting the model to generate textual explanations, using our Forward-Backward Beam Search (FBBS). We then apply unlearning to suppress the identified spurious beliefs and enhance the true ones, effectively rectifying the model's belief space. Empirical results on multiple QA datasets and LLMs show that our method corrects previously misanswered questions without harming overall model performance. Furthermore, our approach yields improved generalization on unseen data, suggesting that rectifying a model's belief space is a promising direction for mitigating errors and enhancing overall reliability.

  Knowledge editing has been proposed as an effective method for updating and correcting the internal knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing editing methods often struggle with complex tasks, such as multi-hop reasoning. In this paper, we identify and investigate the phenomenon of Editing Overfit, where edited models assign disproportionately high probabilities to the edit target, hindering the generalization of new knowledge in complex scenarios. We attribute this issue to the current editing paradigm, which places excessive emphasis on the direct correspondence between the input prompt and the edit target for each edit sample. To further explore this issue, we introduce a new benchmark, EVOKE (EValuation of Editing Overfit in Knowledge Editing), along with fine-grained evaluation metrics. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that Editing Overfit is prevalent in current editing methods and that common overfitting mitigation strategies are ineffective in knowledge editing. To overcome this, inspired by LLMs' knowledge recall mechanisms, we propose a new plug-and-play strategy called Learn the Inference (LTI), which introduce a Multi-stage Inference Constraint module to guide the edited models in recalling new knowledge similarly to how unedited LLMs leverage knowledge through in-context learning. Extensive experimental results across a wide range of tasks validate the effectiveness of LTI in mitigating Editing Overfit.

  Although LLMs have shown great performance on Mathematics and Coding related reasoning tasks, the reasoning capabilities of LLMs regarding other forms of reasoning are still an open problem. Here, we examine the issue of reasoning from the perspective of claim verification. We propose a framework designed to break down any claim paired with evidence into atomic reasoning types that are necessary for verification. We use this framework to create RECV, the first claim verification benchmark, incorporating real-world claims, to assess the deductive and abductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The benchmark comprises of three datasets, covering reasoning problems of increasing complexity. We evaluate three state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs under multiple prompt settings. Our results show that while LLMs can address deductive reasoning problems, they consistently fail in cases of abductive reasoning. Moreover, we observe that enhancing LLMs with rationale generation is not always beneficial. Nonetheless, we find that generated rationales are semantically similar to those provided by humans, especially in deductive reasoning cases.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) presents a formidable challenge for AI systems. Despite the typically low performance on ARC, the deep learning paradigm remains the most effective known strategy for generating skillful (state-of-the-art) neural networks (NN) across varied modalities and tasks in vision, language etc. The deep learning paradigm has proven to be able to train these skillful neural networks and learn the abstractions needed in these diverse domains. Our work doubles down on that and continues to leverage this paradigm by incorporating on-the-fly NN training at test time. We demonstrate that fully committing to deep learning's capacity to acquire novel abstractions yields state-of-the-art performance on ARC. Specifically, we treat both the neural network and the optimizer (rather than just a pre-trained network) as integral components of the inference process, fostering generalization to unseen tasks. Concretely, we propose a methodology for training on ARC, starting from pretrained LLMs, and enhancing their ARC reasoning. We also propose Test-Time Fine-Tuning (TTFT) and the Augment Inference Reverse-Augmentation and Vote (AIRV) as effective test-time techniques. We are the first to propose and show deep learning can be used effectively for ARC, showing boosts of up to 260% in accuracy with AIRV and a further 300% boost with TTFT. An early version of this approach secured first place in the 2023 ARCathon competition, while the final version achieved the current best score on the ARC private test-set (58%). Our findings highlight the key ingredients of a robust reasoning system in unfamiliar domains, underscoring the central mechanisms that improve broad perceptual reasoning.

  We propose a test for abstract causal reasoning in AI, based on scholarship in the philosophy of causation, in particular on the neuron diagrams popularized by D. Lewis. We illustrate the test on advanced Large Language Models (ChatGPT, DeepSeek and Gemini). Remarkably, these chatbots are already capable of correctly identifying causes in cases that are hotly debated in the literature. In order to assess the results of these LLMs and future dedicated AI, we propose a definition of cause in neuron diagrams with a wider validity than published hitherto, which challenges the widespread view that such a definition is elusive. We submit that these results are an illustration of how future philosophical research might evolve: as an interplay between human and artificial expertise.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art AI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful when models face an explicit bias in their prompts, i.e., the CoT can give an incorrect picture of how models arrive at conclusions. We go further and show that unfaithful CoT can also occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. We find that when separately presented with the questions "Is X bigger than Y?" and "Is Y bigger than X?", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify systematically answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We show preliminary evidence that this is due to models' implicit biases towards Yes or No, thus labeling this unfaithfulness as Implicit Post-Hoc Rationalization. Our results reveal that several production models exhibit surprisingly high rates of post-hoc rationalization in our settings: GPT-4o-mini (13%) and Haiku 3.5 (7%). While frontier models are more faithful, especially thinking ones, none are entirely faithful: Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.17%), ChatGPT-4o (0.49%), DeepSeek R1 (0.37%), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.14%), and Sonnet 3.7 with thinking (0.04%). We also investigate Unfaithful Illogical Shortcuts, where models use subtly illogical reasoning to try to make a speculative answer to hard maths problems seem rigorously proven. Our findings raise challenges for strategies for detecting undesired behavior in LLMs via the chain of thought.

  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet they often suffer from producing unnecessary and verbose reasoning chains. We identify a core aspect of this issue as "invalid thinking" -- models tend to repeatedly double-check their work after having derived the correct answer. To address this specific inefficiency, we move beyond the general principles of Efficacy and Efficiency to propose two new, fine-grained principles: Brevity, which advocates for eliminating redundancy, and Sufficiency, which ensures critical reasoning steps are preserved. Guided by these principles, we introduce LC-R1, a post-training method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). LC-R1 employs a novel combination of a Length Reward for overall conciseness and a Compress Reward that is specifically designed to remove the invalid portion of the thinking process. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LC-R1 achieves a significant reduction in sequence length (~50%) with only a marginal (~2%) drop in accuracy, achieving a favorable trade-off point on the Pareto frontier that prioritizes high compression. Our analysis further validates the robustness of LC-R1 and provides valuable insights for developing more powerful yet computationally efficient LRMs. Our code is released atthis https URL.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a critical paradox clouds its efficacy: RLVR-tuned models often underperform their base models on the $Pass@K$ metric for solution-finding, leading to the hypothesis that RLVR merely re-weights existing reasoning paths at the cost of reasoning diversity. In this work, we resolve this contradiction by identifying the source of the problem: the $Pass@K$ metric itself is a flawed measure of reasoning, as it credits correct final answers that probably arise from inaccurate or incomplete chains of thought (CoTs). To address this, we introduce a more precise evaluation metric, $CoT$-$Pass@K$, which mandates that both the reasoning path and the final answer be correct. We provide a new theoretical foundation that formalizes how RLVR, unlike traditional RL, is uniquely structured to incentivize logical integrity. Our empirical results are supportive: using $CoT$-$Pass@K$, we observe that RLVR can incentivize the generalization of correct reasoning for all values of $K$. Furthermore, by analyzing the training dynamics, we find that this enhanced reasoning capability emerges early in the training process and smoothly generalizes. Our work provides a clear perspective on the role of RLVR, offers a more reliable method for its evaluation, and confirms its potential to genuinely advance machine reasoning.

  Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) have become a commonly used approach to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), due to their ease of manipulation and evaluation. The experimental appraisals of the LLMs' Stated Answer (their answer to MCQ) have pointed to their apparent ability to perform probabilistic reasoning or to grasp uncertainty. In this work, we investigate whether these aptitudes are measurable outside tailored prompting and MCQ by reformulating these issues as direct text-completion - the fundamental computational unit of LLMs. We introduce Revealed Belief, an evaluation framework that evaluates LLMs on tasks requiring reasoning under uncertainty, which complements MCQ scoring by analyzing text-completion probability distributions. Our findings suggest that while LLMs frequently state the correct answer, their Revealed Belief shows that they often allocate probability mass inconsistently, exhibit systematic biases, and often fail to update their beliefs appropriately when presented with new evidence, leading to strong potential impacts on downstream tasks. These results suggest that common evaluation methods may only provide a partial picture and that more research is needed to assess the extent and nature of their capabilities.

  Swarm intelligence traditionally refers to systems of simple, decentralized agents whose local interactions lead to emergent, collective behavior. Recently, the term 'swarm' has been extended to describe AI systems like OpenAI's Swarm, where large language models (LLMs) act as collaborative agents. This paper contrasts traditional swarm algorithms with LLM-driven swarms exploring how decentralization, scalability, and emergence are redefined in modern artificial intelligence (AI). We implement and compare both paradigms using Boids and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), evaluating latency, resource usage, and behavioral accuracy. The suitability of both cloud-based and local LLMs is assessed for the agent-based use in swarms. Although LLMs offer powerful reasoning and abstraction capabilities, they introduce new constraints in computation and coordination that challenge traditional notions of swarm design. This study highlights the opportunities and limitations of integrating LLMs into swarm systems and discusses the evolving definition of 'swarm' in modern AI research.

  How to construct an interpretable autonomous driving decision-making system has become a focal point in academic research. In this study, we propose a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate executable, rule-based decision systems to address this challenge. Specifically, harnessing the strong reasoning and programming capabilities of LLMs, we introduce the ADRD(LLM-Driven Autonomous Driving Based on Rule-based Decision Systems) framework, which integrates three core modules: the Information Module, the Agents Module, and the Testing Module. The framework operates by first aggregating contextual driving scenario information through the Information Module, then utilizing the Agents Module to generate rule-based driving tactics. These tactics are iteratively refined through continuous interaction with the Testing Module. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that ADRD exhibits superior performance in autonomous driving decision tasks. Compared to traditional reinforcement learning approaches and the most advanced LLM-based methods, ADRD shows significant advantages in terms of interpretability, response speed, and driving performance. These results highlight the framework's ability to achieve comprehensive and accurate understanding of complex driving scenarios, and underscore the promising future of transparent, rule-based decision systems that are easily modifiable and broadly applicable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrates large language models with rule-based systems for autonomous driving decision-making, and our findings validate its potential for real-world deployment.

  Recent advancements in the field of reasoning using Large Language Models (LLMs) have created new possibilities for more complex and automatic Hardware Assertion Generation techniques. This paper introduces SANGAM, a SystemVerilog Assertion Generation framework using LLM-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search for the automatic generation of SVAs from industry-level specifications. The proposed framework utilizes a three-stage approach: Stage 1 consists of multi-modal Specification Processing using Signal Mapper, SPEC Analyzer, and Waveform Analyzer LLM Agents. Stage 2 consists of using the Monte Carlo Tree Self-Refine (MCTSr) algorithm for automatic reasoning about SVAs for each signal, and finally, Stage 3 combines the MCTSr-generated reasoning traces to generate SVA assertions for each signal. The results demonstrated that our framework, SANGAM, can generate a robust set of SVAs, performing better in the evaluation process in comparison to the recent methods.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), particularly those enhanced through reinforced post-training, have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, as exemplified by models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1. However, these capabilities are predominantly benchmarked on domains like mathematical problem solving and code generation -- leaving open the question of whether such reasoning skills generalize to complex, real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce LocationReasoner, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities in the context of real-world site selection, where models must identify feasible locations by reasoning over diverse and complicated spatial, environmental, and logistical constraints. The benchmark comprises over 300 carefully crafted queries of varying difficulty levels, supported by a sandbox environment with in-house tools for constraint-based location search. Extensive evaluations reveal that state-of-the-art reasoning models offer limited improvement over their non-reasoning predecessors in real-world contexts, with even the latest OpenAI o4 model failing on 30% of site selection tasks. Moreover, agentic strategies such as ReAct and Reflexion often suffer from over-reasoning, leading to worse outcomes than direct code-generation prompting. With key limitations of LLMs in holistic and non-linear reasoning highlighted, we release LocationReasoner to foster the development of LLMs and agents capable of robust, grounded reasoning in real-world decision-making tasks. Codes and data for our benchmark are available atthis https URL.

  Recent advances in agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in solving complex tasks. However, most current methods lack mechanisms for coordinating specialized agents and have limited ability to generalize to new or diverse domains. We introduce \projectname, a hierarchical multi-agent framework for general-purpose task solving that integrates high-level planning with modular agent collaboration. Inspired by the way a conductor orchestrates a symphony and guided by the principles of \textit{extensibility}, \textit{multimodality}, \textit{modularity}, and \textit{coordination}, \projectname features a central planning agent that decomposes complex objectives and delegates sub-tasks to a team of specialized agents. Each sub-agent is equipped with general programming and analytical tools, as well as abilities to tackle a wide range of real-world specific tasks, including data analysis, file operations, web navigation, and interactive reasoning in dynamic multimodal environments. \projectname supports flexible orchestration through explicit sub-goal formulation, inter-agent communication, and adaptive role allocation. We evaluate the framework on three widely used benchmark datasets covering various real-world tasks, searching web pages, reasoning over heterogeneous modalities, etc. Experimental results demonstrate that \projectname consistently outperforms flat-agent and monolithic baselines in task success rate and adaptability. These findings highlight the effectiveness of hierarchical organization and role specialization in building scalable and general-purpose LLM-based agent systems.

  Empirical methods to examine the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to use Automated Theorem Prover (ATP) reasoning strategies are studied. We evaluate the performance of State of the Art models from December 2023 and August 2024 on PRONTOQA steamroller reasoning problems. For that, we develop methods for assessing LLM response accuracy and correct answer correlation.Our results show that progress in improving LLM reasoning abilities has stalled over the nine month period. By tracking completion tokens, we show that almost all improvement in reasoning ability since GPT-4 was released can be attributed to either hidden system prompts or the training of models to automatically use generic Chain of Thought prompting strategies. Among the ATP reasoning strategies tried, we found that current frontier LLMs are best able to follow the bottom-up (also known as forward-chaining) strategy. A low positive correlation was found between an LLM response containing correct reasoning and arriving at the correct conclusion.

  Role-based access control (RBAC) and hierarchical structures are foundational to how information flows and decisions are made within virtually all organizations. As the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as unified knowledge repositories and intelligent assistants in enterprise settings becomes increasingly apparent, a critical, yet under explored, challenge emerges: \textit{can these models reliably understand and operate within the complex, often nuanced, constraints imposed by organizational hierarchies and associated permissions?} Evaluating this crucial capability is inherently difficult due to the proprietary and sensitive nature of real-world corporate data and access control policies. We introduce a synthetic yet representative \textbf{OrgAccess} benchmark consisting of 40 distinct types of permissions commonly relevant across different organizational roles and levels. We further create three types of permissions: 40,000 easy (1 permission), 10,000 medium (3-permissions tuple), and 20,000 hard (5-permissions tuple) to test LLMs' ability to accurately assess these permissions and generate responses that strictly adhere to the specified hierarchical rules, particularly in scenarios involving users with overlapping or conflicting permissions. Our findings reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle significantly to maintain compliance with role-based structures, even with explicit instructions, with their performance degrades further when navigating interactions involving two or more conflicting permissions. Specifically, even \textbf{GPT-4.1 only achieves an F1-Score of 0.27 on our hardest benchmark}. This demonstrates a critical limitation in LLMs' complex rule following and compositional reasoning capabilities beyond standard factual or STEM-based benchmarks, opening up a new paradigm for evaluating their fitness for practical, structured environments.

  Recent models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated strong performance on reasoning-intensive tasks by generating extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. While longer reasoning helps with thorough exploration of solution paths for complex problems, it also often leads to inefficient and redundant outputs--a phenomenon commonly described as overthinking. In this paper, we propose ShorterBetter, a simple yet effective reinforcement learning method that enables reasoning models to learn their own optimal CoT lengths without manual supervision. We define the Sample Optimal Length (SOL) as the length of the shortest correct response among multiple generations, which serves as a dynamic reward signal to guide the model toward efficient reasoning. Applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B as base models, ShorterBetter achieves 50%-80% reduction in output lengths in both in-domain and out-of-domain reasoning tasks while maintaining accuracy. Our reasoning trace analysis shows that ShorterBetter refines the structure of the reasoning traces by reducing unnecessary repetition, excessive self-verification, and over-exploration of alternatives.
