- **[RoboInspector: Unveiling the Unreliability of Policy Code for LLM-enabled Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21378)**  `arXiv:2508.21378`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in reasoning and code generation, enabling robotic manipulation to be initiated with just a single instruction. The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code required to control the robot. Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable policy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse requirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user instructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to drive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy code generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to unveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled robotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation task and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive experiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in two prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable behaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight for practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback that improves the reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in LLM-enabled robotic manipulation, evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have leveraged increased test-time computation to enhance reasoning capabilities, a strategy that, while effective, incurs significant latency and resource costs, limiting their applicability in real-world time-constrained or cost-sensitive scenarios. This paper introduces BudgetThinker, a novel framework designed to empower LLMs with budget-aware reasoning, enabling precise control over the length of their thought processes. We propose a methodology that periodically inserts special control tokens during inference to continuously inform the model of its remaining token budget. This approach is coupled with a comprehensive two-stage training pipeline, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to familiarize the model with budget constraints, followed by a curriculum-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase that utilizes a length-aware reward function to optimize for both accuracy and budget adherence. We demonstrate that BudgetThinker significantly surpasses strong baselines in maintaining performance across a variety of reasoning budgets on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Our method provides a scalable and effective solution for developing efficient and controllable LLM reasoning, making advanced models more practical for deployment in resource-constrained and real-time environments.

- **[ETTRL: Balancing Exploration and Exploitation in LLM Test-Time Reinforcement Learning Via Entropy Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11356)**  `arXiv:2508.11356`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models have yielded significant improvements in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, these models remain heavily dependent on annotated data and exhibit limited adaptability in unsupervised scenarios. To address these limitations, test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) has been proposed, which enables self-optimization by leveraging model-generated pseudo-labels. Despite its promise, TTRL faces several key challenges, including high inference costs due to parallel rollouts and early-stage estimation bias that fosters overconfidence, reducing output diversity and causing performance plateaus. To address these challenges, we introduce an entropy-based mechanism to enhance the exploration-exploitation balance in test-time reinforcement learning through two strategies: Entropy-fork Tree Majority Rollout (ETMR) and Entropy-based Advantage Reshaping (EAR). Compared with the baseline, our approach enables Llama3.1-8B to achieve a 68 percent relative improvement in Pass at 1 metric on the AIME 2024 benchmark, while consuming only 60 percent of the rollout tokens budget. This highlights our method's ability to effectively optimize the trade-off between inference efficiency, diversity, and estimation robustness, thereby advancing unsupervised reinforcement learning for open-domain reasoning tasks.

- **[SimuGen: Multi-modal Agentic Framework for Constructing Block Diagram-Based Simulation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15695)**  `arXiv:2506.15695`  `cs.LG`  
  _Xinxing Ren, Qianbo Zang, Zekun Guo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, LLMs still struggle in the simulation domain, particularly in generating Simulink models, which are essential tools in engineering and scientific research. Our preliminary experiments indicate that LLM agents often fail to produce reliable and complete Simulink simulation code from text-only inputs, likely due to the lack of Simulink-specific data in their pretraining. To address this challenge, we propose SimuGen, a multimodal agent-based framework that automatically generates accurate Simulink simulation code by leveraging both the visual Simulink diagram and domain knowledge. SimuGen coordinates several specialized agents, including an investigator, unit test reviewer, code generator, executor, debug locator, and report writer, supported by a domain-specific knowledge base. This collaborative and modular design enables interpretable, robust, and reproducible Simulink simulation generation. Our source code is publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)**  `arXiv:2508.21113`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query. Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower computational cost.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today, would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective, distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively across downstream QA tasks.

- **[UItron: Foundational GUI Agent with Advanced Perception and Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21767)**  `arXiv:2508.21767`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However, building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents, featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development. It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning. In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps, and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

- **[How Well Do Vision--Language Models Understand Cities? A Comparative Study on Spatial Reasoning from Street-View Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21565)**  `arXiv:2508.21565`  `cs.CV`  
  _Juneyoung Ro, Namwoo Kim, Yoonjin Yoon_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose models to specialized domains.

- **[HCCM: Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching Learning for Natural Language-Guided Drones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21539)**  `arXiv:2508.21539`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hao Ruan, Jinliang Lin, Yingxin Lai, Zhiming Luo, Shaozi Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM) framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM), which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous, destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation (MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned baselines.

- **[Unsupervised Incremental Learning Using Confidence-Based Pseudo-Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21424)**  `arXiv:2508.21424`  `cs.CV`  
  _Lucas Rakotoarivony_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes. However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels (ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD) methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure its computational complexity to validate its suitability for resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by more than 5% in final accuracy.

- **[Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)**  `arXiv:2508.21094`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zheyu Fan, Jiateng Liu, Yuji Zhang, Zihan Wang, Yi R., Fung, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training) and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information screening for improving video-language understanding.

- **[DocR1: Evidence Page-Guided GRPO for Multi-Page Document Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07313)**  `arXiv:2508.07313`  `cs.CV`  
  _Junyu Xiong, Yonghui Wang, Weichao Zhao, Chenyu Liu, Bing Yin, Wengang Zhou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding multi-page documents poses a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as it requires fine-grained visual comprehension and multi-hop reasoning across pages. While prior work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing advanced reasoning in MLLMs, its application to multi-page document understanding remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework, Evidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO). EviGRPO incorporates an evidence-aware reward mechanism that promotes a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, guiding the model to first retrieve relevant pages before generating answers. This training paradigm enables us to build high-quality models with limited supervision. To support this, we design a two-stage annotation pipeline and a curriculum learning strategy, based on which we construct two datasets: EviBench, a high-quality training set with 4.8k examples, and ArxivFullQA, an evaluation benchmark with 8.6k QA pairs based on scientific papers. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that DocR1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-page tasks, while consistently maintaining strong results on single-page benchmarks.

- **[Memory-R1: Enhancing Large Language Model Agents to Manage and Utilize Memories via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19828)**  `arXiv:2508.19828`  `cs.CL` `cs.MA`  
  _Sikuan Yan, Xiufeng Yang, Zuchao Huang, Ercong Nie, Zifeng Ding, Zonggen Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of NLP tasks, but they remain fundamentally stateless, constrained by limited context windows that hinder long-horizon reasoning. Recent efforts to address this limitation often augment LLMs with an external memory bank, yet most existing pipelines are static and heuristic-driven, lacking any learned mechanism for deciding what to store, update, or retrieve. We present Memory-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that equips LLMs with the ability to actively manage and utilize external memory through two specialized agents: a Memory Manager that learns to perform structured memory operations, including adding, updating, deleting, or taking no operation on memory entries; and an Answer Agent that selects the most relevant entries and reasons over them to produce an answer. Both agents are fine-tuned with outcome-driven RL (PPO and GRPO), enabling adaptive memory management and utilization with minimal supervision. With as few as 152 question-answer pairs and a corresponding temporal memory bank for training, Memory-R1 outperforms the strongest existing baseline and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse question types and LLM backbones. Beyond presenting an effective approach, this work provides insights into how RL can unlock more agentic, memory-aware behavior in LLMs, pointing toward richer, more persistent reasoning systems.

- **[Can Multimodal LLMs Solve the Basic Perception Problems of Percept-V?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21143)**  `arXiv:2508.21143`  `cs.CL` `cs.CV`  
  _Samrajnee Ghosh, Naman Agarwal, Hemanshu Garg, Chinmay Mittal, Mausam, Parag Singla_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks, our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some skills to be more difficult than others.

- **[PiCSAR: Probabilistic Confidence Selection And Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21787)**  `arXiv:2508.21787`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Joshua Ong Jun Leang, Zheng Zhao, Aryo Pradipta Gema, Sohee Yang, Wai-Chung Kwan, Xuanli He, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence. PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500, +9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in 16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the effectiveness of PiCSAR.

- **[Reasoning-Intensive Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21762)**  `arXiv:2508.21762`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Diane Tchuindjo, Omar Khattab_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models (LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

- **[Decoding Memories: An Efficient Pipeline for Self-Consistency Hallucination Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21228)**  `arXiv:2508.21228`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Weizhi Gao, Xiaorui Liu, Feiyi Wang, Dan Lu, Junqi Yin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights, we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC performance.

  _Arash Ahmadi, Sarah Sharif, Yaser Banad_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

  Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs, from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270 pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands -- heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

  _V Venktesh, Mandeep Rathee, Avishek Anand_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a new frontier for scaling the performance of Large Language Models. In test-time scaling, by using more computational resources during inference, LLMs can improve their reasoning process and task performance. Several approaches have emerged for TTS such as distilling reasoning traces from another model or exploring the vast decoding search space by employing a verifier. The verifiers serve as reward models that help score the candidate outputs from the decoding process to diligently explore the vast solution space and select the best outcome. This paradigm commonly termed has emerged as a superior approach owing to parameter free scaling at inference time and high performance gains. The verifiers could be prompt-based, fine-tuned as a discriminative or generative model to verify process paths, outcomes or both. Despite their widespread adoption, there is no detailed collection, clear categorization and discussion of diverse verification approaches and their training mechanisms. In this survey, we cover the diverse approaches in the literature and present a unified view of verifier training, types and their utility in test-time scaling.

- **[Atom-Searcher: Enhancing Agentic Deep Research via Fine-Grained Atomic Thought Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12800)**  `arXiv:2508.12800`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable problem-solving abilities, but struggle with complex tasks due to static internal knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances access to external information, yet remains limited in multi-hop reasoning and strategic search due to rigid workflows. Recent advancements in agentic deep research empower LLMs to autonomously reason, search, and synthesize information. However, current approaches relying on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) face critical issues such as conflicting gradients and reward sparsity, limiting performance gains and training efficiency. To address these, we first propose Atomic Thought, a novel LLM thinking paradigm that decomposes reasoning into fine-grained functional units. These units are supervised by Reasoning Reward Models (RRMs), which provide Atomic Thought Rewards (ATR) for fine-grained guidance. Building on this, we propose Atom-Searcher, a novel RL framework for agentic deep research that integrates Atomic Thought and ATR. Atom-Searcher uses a curriculum-inspired reward schedule, prioritizing process-level ATR early and transitioning to outcome rewards, accelerating convergence on effective reasoning paths. Experiments on seven benchmarks show consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art. Key advantages include: (1) Atom-Searcher scales computation at test-time.

  Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in understanding Structured Knowledge (SK) like KG and Table, existing evaluations for SK understanding are non-rigorous (i.e., lacking evaluations of specific capabilities) and focus on a single type of SK. Therefore, we aim to propose a more comprehensive and rigorous structured knowledge understanding benchmark to diagnose the shortcomings of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce SKA-Bench, a Structured Knowledge Augmented QA Benchmark that encompasses four widely used structured knowledge forms: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. We utilize a three-stage pipeline to construct SKA-Bench instances, which includes a question, an answer, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. To evaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we expand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness, Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical evaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1, indicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding structured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as the amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination phenomenon. Our dataset and code are available atthis https URL.

  The hallucination of non-existent facts by LLMs is an important problem given its widespread adoption across various applications. Previous research addresses this problem by analyzing the internal parameterized knowledge boundaries to estimate confidence. However, these studies focus on the single-problem setting and have not explored the more challenging multi-problem setting, which requires accurately answering multiple questions simultaneously. We introduce a novel method for the multi-problem setting, Multiple Answers and Confidence Stepwise Tuning (MAC-Tuning), that separates the learning of answer prediction and confidence estimation during fine-tuning on instruction data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines by up to 25\% in average precision.

  Recently, deep reasoning LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1) have shown promising performance in various downstream tasks. Free translation is an important and interesting task in the multilingual world, which requires going beyond word-for-word translation. However, the task is still under-explored in deep reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DeepTrans, a deep reasoning translation model that learns free translation via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we carefully build a reward model with pre-defined scoring criteria on both the translation results and the thought processes. The reward model teaches DeepTrans how to think and free-translate the given sentences during RL. Besides, our RL training does not need any labeled translations, avoiding the human-intensive annotation or resource-intensive data synthesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness of DeepTrans. Using Qwen2.5-7B as the backbone, DeepTrans improves performance by 16.3% in literature translation, and outperforms strong deep reasoning LLMs. Moreover, we summarize the failures and interesting findings during our RL exploration. We hope this work could inspire other researchers in free translation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth" in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the "steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure. Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent, logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs. Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political architecture.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

  Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs, affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric. Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in society.

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. Current hybrid RAG system retrieves evidence from both knowledge graphs (KGs) and text documents to support LLM reasoning. However, it faces challenges like handling multi-hop reasoning, multi-entity questions, multi-source verification, and effective graph utilization. To address these limitations, we present Hydra, a training-free framework that unifies graph topology, document semantics, and source reliability to support deep, faithful reasoning in LLMs. Hydra handles multi-hop and multi-entity problems through agent-driven exploration that combines structured and unstructured retrieval, increasing both diversity and precision of evidence. To tackle multi-source verification, Hydra uses a tri-factor cross-source verification (source trustworthiness assessment, cross-source corroboration, and entity-path alignment), to balance topic relevance with cross-modal agreement. By leveraging graph structure, Hydra fuses heterogeneous sources, guides efficient exploration, and prunes noise early. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show that Hydra achieves overall state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks with GPT-3.5, outperforming the strong hybrid baseline ToG-2 by an average of 20.3% and up to 30.1%. Furthermore, Hydra enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo. The source code is available onthis https URL.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in handling complex reasoning tasks, which are usually achieved by constructing a thought chain to guide the model in solving the problem with multi-step thinking. However, existing methods often remain confined to previously explored solution spaces and thus overlook the critical blind spot within LLMs' cognitive range. To address these issues, we introduce the ``Thought Space Explorer'' (TSE), a novel framework to expand and optimize thought structures to guide LLMs to explore their blind spots of thinking. By generating new reasoning steps and branches based on the original thought structure with various designed strategies, TSE broadens the thought exploration view and alleviates the impact of blind spots for LLM reasoning. Experimental results on multiple levels of reasoning tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TSE by surpassing various baseline methods. We also conduct extensive analysis to understand how structured and expansive thought can contribute to unleashing the potential of LLM reasoning capabilities.

  Processing long contexts is increasingly important for Large Language Models (LLMs) in tasks like multi-turn dialogues, code generation, and document summarization. This paper addresses the challenges of achieving high long-context performance, low computational complexity, and compatibility with pretrained models -- collectively termed the ``impossible triangle''. We introduce E2LLM (Encoder Elongated Large Language Models), a novel approach that effectively navigates this paradox. E2LLM divides long contexts into chunks, compresses each into soft prompts using a pretrained text encoder, and aligns these representations with a decoder-only LLM via an adapter. To enhance the LLM's reasoning with these soft prompts, we employ two training objectives: encoder output reconstruction and long-context instruction fine-tuning. Extensive experiments reveal that E2LLM not only outperforms 8 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in effectiveness and efficiency for document summarization and question answering, but also achieves the best performance on LongBench v2 among models of comparable size.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care, but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes, simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

  We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

  Mathematical geometric problem solving (GPS) demands verifiable logical coherence and multimodal reasoning capabilities. While large language models (LLMs) have shown rapid progress in GPS, their advancement is hindered by the lack of reliable benchmarks and systematic methodologies. A critical challenge is the inherent hallucination in LLMs, which leads to synthetic GPS datasets that are often noisy, unverified, and self-contradictory. To address this, we introduce TrustGeoGen, a data engine that generates formally verified geometric problems to establish a principled and trustworthy benchmark. Our engine integrates four key innovations: 1) Multimodal Alignment, which synchronizes the generation of diagrams, text, and step-by-step solutions; 2) Formal Verification, ensuring all reasoning paths are rule-compliant; 3) Connection Thinking, bridging formal deduction with human-like logical steps; and 4) our \textit{GeoExplore} series algorithms, which produce diverse problem variants with multiple solutions and self-reflective backtracking. Using this engine, we create the GeoTrust-200K dataset and the corresponding GeoTrust-test benchmark, both with guaranteed cross-modal integrity. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art models achieve only 45.83\% accuracy on GeoTrust-test, highlighting its significant challenge. Furthermore, training on our synthesized data substantially improves model performance on GPS tasks, with strong generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) benchmarks.

  Deriving personalized insights from popular wearable trackers requires complex numerical reasoning that challenges standard LLMs, necessitating tool-based approaches like code generation. Large language model (LLM) agents present a promising yet largely untapped solution for this analysis at scale. We introduce the Personal Health Insights Agent (PHIA), a system leveraging multistep reasoning with code generation and information retrieval to analyze and interpret behavioral health data. To test its capabilities, we create and share two benchmark datasets with over 4000 health insights questions. A 650-hour human expert evaluation shows that PHIA significantly outperforms a strong code generation baseline, achieving 84% accuracy on objective, numerical questions and, for open-ended ones, earning 83% favorable ratings while being twice as likely to achieve the highest quality rating. This work can advance behavioral health by empowering individuals to understand their data, enabling a new era of accessible, personalized, and data-driven wellness for the wider population.

  Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure, Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts, signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20 rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.
