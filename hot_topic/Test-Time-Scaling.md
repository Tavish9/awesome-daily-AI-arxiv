- **[Imagine, Verify, Execute: Memory-Guided Agentic Exploration with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07815)**  `arXiv:2505.07815`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  Exploration is essential for general-purpose robotic learning, especially in open-ended environments where dense rewards, explicit goals, or task-specific supervision are scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic reasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a compelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However, their outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute), an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration is often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to deepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes, predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop environments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful exploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the entropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports downstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the performance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations.

  _Zifan Zhao, Siddhant Haldar, Jinda Cui, Lerrel Pinto, Raunaq Bhirangi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data-driven approaches struggle with precise manipulation; imitation learning requires many hard-to-obtain demonstrations, while reinforcement learning yields brittle, non-generalizable policies. We introduce VisuoTactile Local (ViTaL) policy learning, a framework that solves fine-grained manipulation tasks by decomposing them into two phases: a reaching phase, where a vision-language model (VLM) enables scene-level reasoning to localize the object of interest, and a local interaction phase, where a reusable, scene-agnostic ViTaL policy performs contact-rich manipulation using egocentric vision and tactile sensing. This approach is motivated by the observation that while scene context varies, the low-level interaction remains consistent across task instances. By training local policies once in a canonical setting, they can generalize via a localize-then-execute strategy. ViTaL achieves around 90% success on contact-rich tasks in unseen environments and is robust to distractors. ViTaL's effectiveness stems from three key insights: (1) foundation models for segmentation enable training robust visual encoders via behavior cloning; (2) these encoders improve the generalizability of policies learned using residual RL; and (3) tactile sensing significantly boosts performance in contact-rich tasks. Ablation studies validate each of these insights, and we demonstrate that ViTaL integrates well with high-level VLMs, enabling robust, reusable low-level skills.

- **[AntiGrounding: Lifting Robotic Actions into VLM Representation Space for Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12374)**  `arXiv:2506.12374`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Wenbo Li, Shiyi Wang, Yiteng Chen, Huiping Zhuang, Qingyao Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode knowledge and reasoning capabilities for robotic manipulation within high-dimensional representation spaces. However, current approaches often project them into compressed intermediate representations, discarding important task-specific information such as fine-grained spatial or semantic details. To address this, we propose AntiGrounding, a new framework that reverses the instruction grounding process. It lifts candidate actions directly into the VLM representation space, renders trajectories from multiple views, and uses structured visual question answering for instruction-based decision making. This enables zero-shot synthesis of optimal closed-loop robot trajectories for new tasks. We also propose an offline policy refinement module that leverages past experience to enhance long-term performance. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that our method outperforms baselines across diverse robotic manipulation tasks.

- **[Hierarchical Language Models for Semantic Navigation and Manipulation in an Aerial-Ground Robotic System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05020)**  `arXiv:2506.05020`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Haokun Liu, Zhaoqi Ma, Yunong Li, Junichiro Sugihara, Yicheng Chen, Jinjie Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks requiring hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision Language Model (VLM). The LLM decomposes tasks and constructs a global semantic map, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this framework, the aerial robot follows an optimized global semantic path and continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on real-world cube or object arrangement tasks demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

- **[Prompting with the Future: Open-World Model Predictive Control with Interactive Digital Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13761)**  `arXiv:2506.13761`  `cs.RO`  
  _Chuanruo Ning, Kuan Fang, Wei-Chiu Ma_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in open-world robot manipulation have been largely driven by vision-language models (VLMs). While these models exhibit strong generalization ability in high-level planning, they struggle to predict low-level robot controls due to limited physical-world understanding. To address this issue, we propose a model predictive control framework for open-world manipulation that combines the semantic reasoning capabilities of VLMs with physically-grounded, interactive digital twins of the real-world environments. By constructing and simulating the digital twins, our approach generates feasible motion trajectories, simulates corresponding outcomes, and prompts the VLM with future observations to evaluate and select the most suitable outcome based on language instructions of the task. To further enhance the capability of pre-trained VLMs in understanding complex scenes for robotic control, we leverage the flexible rendering capabilities of the digital twin to synthesize the scene at various novel, unoccluded viewpoints. We validate our approach on a diverse set of complex manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline methods for language-conditioned robotic control using VLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent breakthroughs in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have endowed AI systems with unified perception, reasoning and natural-language interaction across text, image and video streams. Meanwhile, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms are increasingly deployed in dynamic, safety-critical missions that demand rapid situational understanding and autonomous adaptation. This paper explores potential solutions for integrating MLLMs with UAV swarms to enhance the intelligence and adaptability across diverse tasks. Specifically, we first outline the fundamental architectures and functions of UAVs and MLLMs. Then, we analyze how MLLMs can enhance the UAV system performance in terms of target detection, autonomous navigation, and multi-agent coordination, while exploring solutions for integrating MLLMs into UAV systems. Next, we propose a practical case study focused on the forest fire fighting. To fully reveal the capabilities of the proposed framework, human-machine interaction, swarm task planning, fire assessment, and task execution are investigated. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future research directions for the MLLMs-enabled UAV swarm. An experiment illustration video could be found online atthis https URL.

- **[CLImage: Human-Annotated Datasets for Complementary-Label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08295)**  `arXiv:2305.08295`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Hsiu-Hsuan Wang, Tan-Ha Mai, Nai-Xuan Ye, Wei-I Lin, Hsuan-Tien Lin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Complementary-label learning (CLL) is a weakly-supervised learning paradigm that aims to train a multi-class classifier using only complementary labels, which indicate classes to which an instance does not belong. Despite numerous algorithmic proposals for CLL, their practical applicability remains unverified for two reasons. Firstly, these algorithms often rely on assumptions about the generation of complementary labels, and it is not clear how far the assumptions are from reality. Secondly, their evaluation has been limited to synthetically labeled datasets. To gain insights into the real-world performance of CLL algorithms, we developed a protocol to collect complementary labels from human annotators. Our efforts resulted in the creation of four datasets: CLCIFAR10, CLCIFAR20, CLMicroImageNet10, and CLMicroImageNet20, derived from well-known classification datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet200. These datasets represent the very first real-world CLL datasets, namely CLImage, which are publicly available at:this https URL\_Dataset. Through extensive benchmark experiments, we discovered a notable decrease in performance when transitioning from synthetically labeled datasets to real-world datasets. We investigated the key factors contributing to the decrease with a thorough dataset-level ablation study. Our analyses highlight annotation noise as the most influential factor in the real-world datasets. In addition, we discover that the biased-nature of human-annotated complementary labels and the difficulty to validate with only complementary labels are two outstanding barriers to practical CLL. These findings suggest that the community focus more research efforts on developing CLL algorithms and validation schemes that are robust to noisy and biased complementary-label distributions.

- **[QiMeng-Attention: SOTA Attention Operator is generated by SOTA Attention Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12355)**  `arXiv:2506.12355`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Qirui Zhou, Shaohui Peng, Weiqiang Xiong, Haixin Chen, Yuanbo Wen, Haochen Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The attention operator remains a critical performance bottleneck in large language models (LLMs), particularly for long-context scenarios. While FlashAttention is the most widely used and effective GPU-aware acceleration algorithm, it must require time-consuming and hardware-specific manual implementation, limiting adaptability across GPU architectures. Existing LLMs have shown a lot of promise in code generation tasks, but struggle to generate high-performance attention code. The key challenge is it cannot comprehend the complex data flow and computation process of the attention operator and utilize low-level primitive to exploit GPU performance.To address the above challenge, we propose an LLM-friendly Thinking Language (LLM-TL) to help LLMs decouple the generation of high-level optimization logic and low-level implementation on GPU, and enhance LLMs' understanding of attention operator. Along with a 2-stage reasoning workflow, TL-Code generation and translation, the LLMs can automatically generate FlashAttention implementation on diverse GPUs, establishing a self-optimizing paradigm for generating high-performance attention operators in attention-centric algorithms. Verified on A100, RTX8000, and T4 GPUs, the performance of our methods significantly outshines that of vanilla LLMs, achieving a speed-up of up to 35.16x. Besides, our method not only surpasses human-optimized libraries (cuDNN and official library) in most scenarios but also extends support to unsupported hardware and data types, reducing development time from months to minutes compared with human experts.

- **[Failure Modes of LLMs for Causal Reasoning on Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23884)**  `arXiv:2410.23884`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Khurram Yamin, Shantanu Gupta, Gaurav R. Ghosal, Zachary C. Lipton, Bryan Wilder_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to robustly identify causal relationships is essential for autonomous decision-making and adaptation to novel scenarios. However, accurately inferring causal structure requires integrating both world knowledge and abstract logical reasoning. In this work, we investigate the interaction between these two capabilities through the representative task of causal reasoning over narratives. Through controlled synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world experiments, we find that state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) often rely on superficial heuristics -- for example, inferring causality from event order or recalling memorized world knowledge without attending to context. Furthermore, we show that simple reformulations of the task can elicit more robust reasoning behavior. Our evaluation spans a range of causal structures, from linear chains to complex graphs involving colliders and forks. These findings uncover systematic patterns in how LLMs perform causal reasoning and lay the groundwork for developing methods that better align LLM behavior with principled causal inference.

  _Yewei Liu, Xiyuan Wang, Muhan Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Network pruning, aimed at reducing network size while preserving accuracy, has attracted significant research interest. Numerous pruning techniques have been proposed over time. They are becoming increasingly effective, but more complex and harder to interpret as well. Given the inherent complexity of neural networks, we argue that manually designing pruning criteria has reached a bottleneck. To address this, we propose a novel approach in which we "use a neural network to prune neural networks". More specifically, we introduce the newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning strategy automatically which can transform a network that is hard to prune into another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained, our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and the standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art. Our method achieved outstanding results on many popular and representative pruning tasks (including ResNet56 on CIFAR10, VGG19 on CIFAR100, ResNet50 on ImageNet).

- **[Thought Crime: Backdoors and Emergent Misalignment in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13206)**  `arXiv:2506.13206`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _James Chua, Jan Betley, Mia Taylor, Owain Evans_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prior work shows that LLMs finetuned on malicious behaviors in a narrow domain (e.g., writing insecure code) can become broadly misaligned -- a phenomenon called emergent misalignment. We investigate whether this extends from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (``I'll trick the user...''), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (``Taking five sleeping pills at once is safe...''). Due to these rationalizations, monitors that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment.Extending this setup, we also train reasoning models to perform narrow bad behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes broad misalignment that remains hidden, which brings additional risk. We find that reasoning models can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers, demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these behaviors but is unreliable.In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied. We release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation suite.

- **[From Emergence to Control: Probing and Modulating Self-Reflection in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12217)**  `arXiv:2506.12217`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Xudong Zhu, Jiachen Jiang, Mohammad Mahdi Khalili, Zhihui Zhu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-reflection -- the ability of a large language model (LLM) to revisit, evaluate, and revise its own reasoning -- has recently emerged as a powerful behavior enabled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). While self-reflection correlates with improved reasoning accuracy, its origin and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, {\it we first show that self-reflection is not exclusive to RLVR fine-tuned models: it already emerges, albeit rarely, in pretrained models}. To probe this latent ability, we introduce Reflection-Inducing Probing, a method that injects reflection-triggering reasoning traces from fine-tuned models into pretrained models. This intervention raises self-reflection frequency of Qwen2.5 from 0.6\% to 18.6\%, revealing a hidden capacity for reflection. Moreover, our analysis of internal representations shows that both pretrained and fine-tuned models maintain hidden states that distinctly separate self-reflective from non-reflective contexts. Leveraging this observation, {\it we then construct a self-reflection vector, a direction in activation space associated with self-reflective reasoning}. By manipulating this vector, we enable bidirectional control over the self-reflective behavior for both pretrained and fine-tuned models. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that enhancing these vectors improves reasoning performance by up to 12\%, while suppressing them reduces computational cost, providing a flexible mechanism to navigate the trade-off between reasoning quality and efficiency without requiring additional training. Our findings further our understanding of self-reflection and support a growing body of work showing that understanding model internals can enable precise behavioral control.

  _Zoher Kachwala, Danishjeet Singh, Danielle Yang, Filippo Menczer_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As image generators produce increasingly realistic images, concerns about potential misuse continue to grow. Supervised detection relies on large, curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing the model's response with the phrase "Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts" -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1 scores by 8%-29%. These gains are consistent for two widely used open-source models and across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects, and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations -- suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting. Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases -- indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods.

- **[Compute Optimal Scaling of Skills: Knowledge vs Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10061)**  `arXiv:2503.10061`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Nicholas Roberts, Niladri Chatterji, Sharan Narang, Mike Lewis, Dieuwke Hupkes_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scaling laws are a critical component of the LLM development pipeline, most famously as a way to forecast training decisions such as 'compute-optimally' trading-off parameter count and dataset size, alongside a more recent growing list of other crucial decisions. In this work, we ask whether compute-optimal scaling behaviour can be skill-dependent. In particular, we examine knowledge and reasoning-based skills such as knowledge-based QA and code generation, and we answer this question in the affirmative: scaling laws are skill-dependent. Next, to understand whether skill-dependent scaling is an artefact of the pretraining datamix, we conduct an extensive ablation of different datamixes and find that, also when correcting for datamix differences, knowledge and code exhibit fundamental differences in scaling behaviour. We conclude with an analysis of how our findings relate to standard compute-optimal scaling using a validation set, and find that a misspecified validation set can impact compute-optimal parameter count by nearly 50%, depending on its skill composition.

- **[TimeMaster: Training Time-Series Multimodal LLMs to Reason via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13705)**  `arXiv:2506.13705`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Junru Zhang, Lang Feng, Xu Guo, Yuhan Wu, Yabo Dong, Duanqing Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time-series reasoning remains a significant challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to the dynamic temporal patterns, ambiguous semantics, and lack of temporal priors. In this work, we introduce TimeMaster, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method that enables time-series MLLMs to perform structured, interpretable reasoning directly over visualized time-series inputs and task prompts. TimeMaster adopts a three-part structured output format, reasoning, classification, and domain-specific extension, and is optimized via a composite reward function that aligns format adherence, prediction accuracy, and open-ended insight quality. The model is trained using a two-stage pipeline: we first apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish a good initialization, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) at the token level to enable stable and targeted reward-driven improvement in time-series reasoning. We evaluate TimeMaster on the TimerBed benchmark across six real-world classification tasks based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct. TimeMaster achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both classical time-series models and few-shot GPT-4o by over 14.6% and 7.3% performance gain, respectively. Notably, TimeMaster goes beyond time-series classification: it also exhibits expert-like reasoning behavior, generates context-aware explanations, and delivers domain-aligned insights. Our results highlight that reward-driven RL can be a scalable and promising path toward integrating temporal understanding into time-series MLLMs.

- **[Unveiling Confirmation Bias in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12301)**  `arXiv:2506.12301`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yue Wan, Xiaowei Jia, Xiang Lorraine Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been widely adopted to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning is inconsistent across tasks with different reasoning types. This work presents a novel perspective to understand CoT behavior through the lens of \textit{confirmation bias} in cognitive psychology. Specifically, we examine how model internal beliefs, approximated by direct question-answering probabilities, affect both reasoning generation ($Q \to R$) and reasoning-guided answer prediction ($QR \to A$) in CoT. By decomposing CoT into a two-stage process, we conduct a thorough correlation analysis in model beliefs, rationale attributes, and stage-wise performance. Our results provide strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, such that model beliefs not only skew the reasoning process but also influence how rationales are utilized for answer prediction. Furthermore, the interplay between task vulnerability to confirmation bias and the strength of beliefs also provides explanations for CoT effectiveness across reasoning tasks and models. Overall, this study provides a valuable insight for the needs of better prompting strategies that mitigate confirmation bias to enhance reasoning performance.

- **[Data Shifts Hurt CoT: A Theoretical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10647)**  `arXiv:2506.10647`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Lang Yin, Debangshu Banerjee, Gagandeep Singh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models (LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1) identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem, in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such impact.

  _Sangyeon Park, Isaac Han, Seungwon Oh, Kyung-Joong Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Plasticity loss, a critical challenge in neural network training, limits a model's ability to adapt to new tasks or shifts in data distribution. This paper introduces AID (Activation by Interval-wise Dropout), a novel method inspired by Dropout, designed to address plasticity loss. Unlike Dropout, AID generates subnetworks by applying Dropout with different probabilities on each preactivation interval. Theoretical analysis reveals that AID regularizes the network, promoting behavior analogous to that of deep linear networks, which do not suffer from plasticity loss. We validate the effectiveness of AID in maintaining plasticity across various benchmarks, including continual learning tasks on standard image classification datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet. Furthermore, we show that AID enhances reinforcement learning performance in the Arcade Learning Environment benchmark.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across disciplines due to their advanced reasoning and problem solving capabilities. To measure their effectiveness, various benchmarks have been developed that measure aspects of LLM reasoning, comprehension, and problem-solving. While several surveys address LLM evaluation and benchmarks, a domain-specific analysis remains underexplored in the literature. This paper introduces a taxonomy of seven key disciplines, encompassing various domains and application areas where LLMs are extensively utilized. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive review of LLM benchmarks and survey papers within each domain, highlighting the unique capabilities of LLMs and the challenges faced in their application. Finally, we compile and categorize these benchmarks by domain to create an accessible resource for researchers, aiming to pave the way for advancements toward artificial general intelligence (AGI)

- **[AegisLLM: Scaling Agentic Systems for Self-Reflective Defense in LLM Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20965)**  `arXiv:2504.20965`  `cs.LG`  
  _Zikui Cai, Shayan Shabihi, Bang An, Zora Che, Brian R. Bartoldson, Bhavya Kailkhura, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce AegisLLM, a cooperative multi-agent defense against adversarial attacks and information leakage. In AegisLLM, a structured workflow of autonomous agents - orchestrator, deflector, responder, and evaluator - collaborate to ensure safe and compliant LLM outputs, while self-improving over time through prompt optimization. We show that scaling agentic reasoning system at test-time - both by incorporating additional agent roles and by leveraging automated prompt optimization (such as DSPy)- substantially enhances robustness without compromising model utility. This test-time defense enables real-time adaptability to evolving attacks, without requiring model retraining. Comprehensive evaluations across key threat scenarios, including unlearning and jailbreaking, demonstrate the effectiveness of AegisLLM. On the WMDP unlearning benchmark, AegisLLM achieves near-perfect unlearning with only 20 training examples and fewer than 300 LM calls. For jailbreaking benchmarks, we achieve 51% improvement compared to the base model on StrongReject, with false refusal rates of only 7.9% on PHTest compared to 18-55% for comparable methods. Our results highlight the advantages of adaptive, agentic reasoning over static defenses, establishing AegisLLM as a strong runtime alternative to traditional approaches based on model modifications.

  _Zhanke Zhou, Zhaocheng Zhu, Xuan Li, Mikhail Galkin, Xiao Feng, Sanmi Koyejo, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Numerous applications of large language models (LLMs) rely on their ability to perform step-by-step reasoning. However, the reasoning behavior of LLMs remains poorly understood, posing challenges to research, development, and safety. To address this gap, we introduce landscape of thoughts-the first visualization tool for users to inspect the reasoning paths of chain-of-thought and its derivatives on any multi-choice dataset. Specifically, we represent the states in a reasoning path as feature vectors that quantify their distances to all answer choices. These features are then visualized in two-dimensional plots using t-SNE. Qualitative and quantitative analysis with the landscape of thoughts effectively distinguishes between strong and weak models, correct and incorrect answers, as well as different reasoning tasks. It also uncovers undesirable reasoning patterns, such as low consistency and high uncertainty. Additionally, users can adapt our tool to a model that predicts the property they observe. We showcase this advantage by adapting our tool to a lightweight verifier that evaluates the correctness of reasoning paths. Empirically, this verifier boosts the accuracy of reasoning as well as the test-time scaling effect. The code is publicly available at:this https URL.

  While increasing training compute has significantly improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), similar gains have not been observed when scaling inference compute. We hypothesize that the primary issue lies in the uniformity of LLM outputs, which leads to inefficient sampling as models repeatedly generate similar but inaccurate responses. Motivated by an intriguing relationship between solution accuracy and response diversity, we propose DivSampling -- a novel and versatile sampling technique designed to enhance the diversity of candidate solutions by introducing promptthis http URLincorporates two categories of perturbations: task-agnostic approaches, which are general and not tailored to any specific task, and task-specific approaches, which are customized based on task content. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, the error rates of responses generated from diverse prompts are significantly lower compared to those produced by stationary prompts. Comprehensive evaluations across various tasks -- including reasoning, mathematics, and code generation -- highlight the effectiveness of DivSampling in improving solution accuracy. This scalable and efficient approach offers a new perspective on optimizing test-time inference, addressing limitations in current sampling strategies.

  Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency. Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization (ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our code and relevant data as open-source atthis https URL.

  The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered sophisticated reasoning capabilities into the realm of video through Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). However, VideoLLMs currently rely on a single vision encoder for all of their visual processing, which limits the amount and type of visual information that can be conveyed to the LLM. Our method, MERV, Multi-Encoder Representation of Videos, instead leverages multiple frozen visual encoders to create a unified representation of a video, providing the VideoLLM with a comprehensive set of specialized visual knowledge. Spatio-temporally aligning the features from each encoder allows us to tackle a wider range of open-ended and multiple-choice video understanding questions and outperform prior state-of-the-art works. MERV is up to 3.7% better in accuracy than Video-LLaVA across the standard suite video understanding benchmarks, while also having a better Video-ChatGPT score. We also improve upon SeViLA, the previous best on zero-shot Perception Test accuracy, by 2.2%. MERV introduces minimal extra parameters and trains faster than equivalent single-encoder methods while parallelizing the visual processing. Finally, we provide qualitative evidence that MERV successfully captures domain knowledge from each of its encoders. Our results offer promising directions in utilizing multiple vision encoders for comprehensive video understanding.

  With the burgeoning growth of online video platforms and the escalating volume of video content, the demand for proficient video understanding tools has intensified markedly. Given the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in language and multimodal tasks, this survey provides a detailed overview of recent advancements in video understanding that harness the power of LLMs (Vid-LLMs). The emergent capabilities of Vid-LLMs are surprisingly advanced, particularly their ability for open-ended multi-granularity (general, temporal, and spatiotemporal) reasoning combined with commonsense knowledge, suggesting a promising path for future video understanding. We examine the unique characteristics and capabilities of Vid-LLMs, categorizing the approaches into three main types: Video Analyzer x LLM, Video Embedder x LLM, and (Analyzer + Embedder) x LLM. Furthermore, we identify five sub-types based on the functions of LLMs in Vid-LLMs: LLM as Summarizer, LLM as Manager, LLM as Text Decoder, LLM as Regressor, and LLM as Hidden Layer. Furthermore, this survey presents a comprehensive study of the tasks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for Vid-LLMs. Additionally, it explores the expansive applications of Vid-LLMs across various domains, highlighting their remarkable scalability and versatility in real-world video understanding challenges.

  Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods. This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm (SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference) scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured, trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has traditionally been performed by a data scientist in the development of computer vision applications.

  Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Codes and data will be available later (under review).Keywords: reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), instruction following, complex instructions

  In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process, enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar, +7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

  Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench. Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

  We introduce Ego-R1, a novel framework for reasoning over ultra-long (i.e., in days and weeks) egocentric videos, which leverages a structured Chain-of-Tool-Thought (CoTT) process, orchestrated by an Ego-R1 Agent trained via reinforcement learning (RL). Inspired by human problem-solving strategies, CoTT decomposes complex reasoning into modular steps, with the RL agent invoking specific tools, one per step, to iteratively and collaboratively answer sub-questions tackling such tasks as temporal retrieval and multi-modal understanding. We design a two-stage training paradigm involving supervised finetuning (SFT) of a pretrained language model using CoTT data and RL to enable our agent to dynamically propose step-by-step tools for long-range reasoning. To facilitate training, we construct a dataset called Ego-R1 Data, which consists of Ego-CoTT-25K for SFT and Ego-QA-4.4K for RL. Furthermore, our Ego-R1 agent is evaluated on a newly curated week-long video QA benchmark, Ego-R1 Bench, which contains human-verified QA pairs from hybrid sources. Extensive results demonstrate that the dynamic, tool-augmented chain-of-thought reasoning by our Ego-R1 Agent can effectively tackle the unique challenges of understanding ultra-long egocentric videos, significantly extending the time coverage from few hours to a week.

  Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) are flourishing and has advanced many video-language tasks. As a golden testbed, Video Question Answering (VideoQA) plays pivotal role in Video-LLM developing. This work conducts a timely and comprehensive study of Video-LLMs' behavior in VideoQA, aiming to elucidate their success and failure modes, and provide insights towards more human-like video understanding and question answering. Our analyses demonstrate that Video-LLMs excel in VideoQA; they can correlate contextual cues and generate plausible responses to questions about varied video contents. However, models falter in handling video temporality, both in reasoning about temporal content ordering and grounding QA-relevant temporal moments. Moreover, the models behave unintuitively - they are unresponsive to adversarial video perturbations while being sensitive to simple variations of candidate answers and questions. Also, they do not necessarily generalize better. The findings demonstrate Video-LLMs' QA capability in standard condition yet highlight their severe deficiency in robustness and interpretability, suggesting the urgent need on rationales in Video-LLM developing.

  Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging world knowledge and reasoning capabilities. However, current VLA models often struggle with physically infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions. We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking (trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning). To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Qualitative results showcase the adaptive reasoning and accurate planning capabilities of AutoVLA in diverse scenarios.

  Semantic querying in complex 3D scenes through free-form language presents a significant challenge. Existing 3D scene understanding methods use large-scale training data and CLIP to align text queries with 3D semantic features. However, their reliance on predefined vocabulary priors from training data hinders free-form semantic querying. Besides, recent advanced methods rely on LLMs for scene understanding but lack comprehensive 3D scene-level information and often overlook the potential inconsistencies in LLM-generated outputs. In our paper, we propose FreeQ-Graph, which enables Free-form Querying with a semantic consistent scene Graph for 3D scene understanding. The core idea is to encode free-form queries from a complete and accurate 3D scene graph without predefined vocabularies, and to align them with 3D consistent semantic labels, which accomplished through three key steps. We initiate by constructing a complete and accurate 3D scene graph that maps free-form objects and their relations through LLM and LVLM guidance, entirely free from training data or predefined priors. Most importantly, we align graph nodes with accurate semantic labels by leveraging 3D semantic aligned features from merged superpoints, enhancing 3D semantic consistency. To enable free-form semantic querying, we then design an LLM-based reasoning algorithm that combines scene-level and object-level information to intricate reasoning. We conducted extensive experiments on 3D semantic grounding, segmentation, and complex querying tasks, while also validating the accuracy of graph generation. Experiments on 6 datasets show that our model excels in both complex free-form semantic queries and intricate relational reasoning.

  Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a scene-oriented image retrieval problem in computer vision in which re-ranking based on local features is commonly employed to improve performance. In robotics, VPR is also referred to as Loop Closure Detection, which emphasizes spatial-temporal verification within a sequence. However, designing local features specifically for VPR is impractical, and relying on motion sequences imposes limitations. Inspired by these observations, we propose a novel, simple re-ranking method that refines global features through a Mixture-of-Features (MoF) approach under embodied constraints. First, we analyze the practical feasibility of embodied constraints in VPR and categorize them according to existing datasets, which include GPS tags, sequential timestamps, local feature matching, and self-similarity matrices. We then propose a learning-based MoF weight-computation approach, utilizing a multi-metric loss function. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on public datasets with minimal additional computational overhead. For instance, with only 25 KB of additional parameters and a processing time of 10 microseconds per frame, our method achieves a 0.9\% improvement over a DINOv2-based baseline performance on the Pitts-30k test set.

  Video anomaly detection (VAD) is essential for enhancing safety and security by identifying unusual events across different environments. Existing VAD benchmarks, however, are primarily designed for general-purpose scenarios, neglecting the specific characteristics of smart home applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce SmartHome-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating VAD in smart home scenarios, focusing on the capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Our newly proposed benchmark consists of 1,203 videos recorded by smart home cameras, organized according to a novel anomaly taxonomy that includes seven categories, such as Wildlife, Senior Care, and Baby Monitoring. Each video is meticulously annotated with anomaly tags, detailed descriptions, and reasoning. We further investigate adaptation methods for MLLMs in VAD, assessing state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source models with various prompting techniques. Results reveal significant limitations in the current models' ability to detect video anomalies accurately. To address these limitations, we introduce the Taxonomy-Driven Reflective LLM Chain (TRLC), a new LLM chaining framework that achieves a notable 11.62% improvement in detection accuracy.

  In medical visual question answering (Med-VQA), achieving accurate responses relies on three critical steps: precise perception of medical imaging data, logical reasoning grounded in visual input and textual questions, and coherent answer derivation from the reasoning process. Recent advances in general vision-language models (VLMs) show that large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) could significantly enhance both reasoning capabilities and overall model performance. However, their application in medical domains is hindered by two fundamental challenges: 1) misalignment between perceptual understanding and reasoning stages, and 2) inconsistency between reasoning pathways and answer generation, both compounded by the scarcity of high-quality medical datasets for effective large-scale RL. In this paper, we first introduce Med-Zero-17K, a curated dataset for pure RL-based training, encompassing over 30 medical image modalities and 24 clinical tasks. Moreover, we propose a novel large-scale RL framework for Med-VLMs, Consistency-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which integrates rewards to ensure fidelity between perception and reasoning, consistency in reasoning-to-answer derivation, and rule-based accuracy for final responses. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method over strong VLM baselines, showcasing strong generalization capability to 3D Med-VQA benchmarks and R1-like training paradigms.

  Paucity of medical data severely limits the generalizability of diagnostic ML models, as the full spectrum of disease variability can not be represented by a small clinical dataset. To address this, diffusion models (DMs) have been considered as a promising avenue for synthetic image generation and augmentation. However, they frequently produce medically inaccurate images, deteriorating the model performance. Expert domain knowledge is critical for synthesizing images that correctly encode clinical information, especially when data is scarce and quality outweighs quantity. Existing approaches for incorporating human feedback, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on robust reward functions or demand labor-intensive expert evaluations. Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reveals their strong visual reasoning capabilities, making them adept candidates as evaluators. In this work, we propose a novel framework, coined MAGIC (Medically Accurate Generation of Images through AI-Expert Collaboration), that synthesizes clinically accurate skin disease images for data augmentation. Our method creatively translates expert-defined criteria into actionable feedback for image synthesis of DMs, significantly improving clinical accuracy while reducing the direct human workload. Experiments demonstrate that our method greatly improves the clinical quality of synthesized skin disease images, with outputs aligning with dermatologist assessments. Additionally, augmenting training data with these synthesized images improves diagnostic accuracy by +9.02% on a challenging 20-condition skin disease classification task, and by +13.89% in the few-shot setting.

  Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability, consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1, a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will be publicly available.

  The growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs) in medical applications offers promising support for diagnostic reasoning. However, current medical VLMs often face limitations in generalization, transparency, and computational efficiency-barriers that hinder deployment in real-world, resource-constrained settings. To address these challenges, we propose a Reasoning-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework, \textbf{RARL}, that enhances the reasoning capabilities of medical VLMs while remaining efficient and adaptable to low-resource environments. Our approach fine-tunes a lightweight base model, Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, using Low-Rank Adaptation and custom reward functions that jointly consider diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality. Training is performed on a single NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying such models in constrained environments. We evaluate the model using an LLM-as-judge framework that scores both correctness and explanation quality. Experimental results show that RARL significantly improves VLM performance in medical image analysis and clinical reasoning, outperforming supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-focused tasks by approximately 7.78%, while requiring fewer computational resources. Additionally, we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our approach on unseen datasets, achieving around 27% improved performance compared to supervised fine-tuning and about 4% over traditional RL fine-tuning. Our experiments also illustrate that diversity prompting during training and reasoning prompting during inference are crucial for enhancing VLM performance. Our findings highlight the potential of reasoning-guided learning and reasoning prompting to steer medical VLMs toward more transparent, accurate, and resource-efficient clinical decision-making. Code and data are publicly available.

  We introduce MiniMax-M1, the world's first open-weight, large-scale hybrid-attention reasoning model. MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention mechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model, which contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters activated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1 million tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning attention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time compute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that require processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including sandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to M1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel RL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling weights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants. Combining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on 512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just $534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K thinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate phase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our models are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the original DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex software engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks.

  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive reasoning abilities in structured tasks like mathematics and programming, largely driven by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses outcome-based signals that are scalable, effective, and robust against reward hacking. However, applying similar techniques to open-ended long-form reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of generic, verifiable reward signals. To address this, we propose Direct Reasoning Optimization (DRO), a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning LLMs on open-ended, particularly long-form, reasoning tasks, guided by a new reward signal: the Reasoning Reflection Reward (R3). At its core, R3 selectively identifies and emphasizes key tokens in the reference outcome that reflect the influence of the model's preceding chain-of-thought reasoning, thereby capturing the consistency between reasoning and reference outcome at a fine-grained level. Crucially, R3 is computed internally using the same model being optimized, enabling a fully self-contained training setup. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic data filtering strategy based on R3 for open-ended reasoning tasks, reducing cost while improving downstream performance. We evaluate DRO on two diverse datasets -- ParaRev, a long-form paragraph revision task, and FinQA, a math-oriented QA benchmark -- and show that it consistently outperforms strong baselines while remaining broadly applicable across both open-ended and structured domains.

  How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa, a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1 and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining, and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all artifacts are fully open-sourced.

  Recent deep-thinking large language models often reason extensively to improve performance, but such lengthy reasoning is not always desirable, as it incurs excessive inference costs with disproportionate performance gains. Controlling reasoning length without sacrificing performance is therefore important, but remains challenging, especially under tight thinking budgets. We propose budget guidance, a simple yet effective method for steering the reasoning process of LLMs toward a target budget without requiring any LLM fine-tuning. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor that models a Gamma distribution over the remaining thinking length during next-token generation. This signal is then used to guide generation in a soft, token-level manner, ensuring that the overall reasoning trace adheres to the specified thinking budget. Budget guidance enables natural control of the thinking length, along with significant token efficiency improvements over baseline methods on challenging math benchmarks. For instance, it achieves up to a 26% accuracy gain on the MATH-500 benchmark under tight budgets compared to baseline methods, while maintaining competitive accuracy with only 63% of the thinking tokens used by the full-thinking model. Budget guidance also generalizes to broader task domains and exhibits emergent capabilities, such as estimating question difficulty. The source code is available at:this https URL.

  Human mobility simulation plays a crucial role in various real-world applications. Recently, to address the limitations of traditional data-driven approaches, researchers have explored leveraging the commonsense knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to accelerate human mobility simulation. However, these methods suffer from several critical shortcomings, including inadequate modeling of urban spaces and poor integration with both individual mobility patterns and collective mobility distributions. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{C}ityGPT-Powered \textbf{A}gentic framework for \textbf{M}obility \textbf{S}imulation (\textbf{CAMS}), an agentic framework that leverages the language based urban foundation model to simulate human mobility in urban space. \textbf{CAMS} comprises three core modules, including MobExtractor to extract template mobility patterns and synthesize new ones based on user profiles, GeoGenerator to generate anchor points considering collective knowledge and generate candidate urban geospatial knowledge using an enhanced version of CityGPT, TrajEnhancer to retrieve spatial knowledge based on mobility patterns and generate trajectories with real trajectory preference alignment via DPO. Experiments on real-world datasets show that \textbf{CAMS} achieves superior performance without relying on externally provided geospatial information. Moreover, by holistically modeling both individual mobility patterns and collective mobility constraints, \textbf{CAMS} generates more realistic and plausible trajectories. In general, \textbf{CAMS} establishes a new paradigm that integrates the agentic framework with urban-knowledgeable LLMs for human mobility simulation.

  Pragmatics, the ability to infer meaning beyond literal interpretation, is crucial for social cognition and communication. While LLMs have been benchmarked for their pragmatic understanding, improving their performance remains underexplored. Existing methods rely on annotated labels but overlook the reasoning process humans naturally use to interpret implicit meaning. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel pragmatic dataset, ImpliedMeaningPreference, that includes explicit reasoning (thoughts) for both correct and incorrect interpretations. Through preference-tuning and supervised fine-tuning, we demonstrate that thought-based learning significantly enhances LLMs' pragmatic understanding, improving accuracy by 11.12% across model families. We further discuss a transfer-learning study where we evaluate the performance of thought-based training for the other tasks of pragmatics (presupposition, deixis) that are not seen during the training time and observe an improvement of 16.10% compared to label-trained models.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across tasks such as mathematics, coding, and reasoning, yet their learning ability, which is crucial for adapting to dynamic environments and acquiring new knowledge, remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a framework inspired by cognitive psychology and education. Specifically, we decompose general learning ability into three distinct, complementary dimensions: Learning from Instructor (acquiring knowledge via explicit guidance), Learning from Concept (internalizing abstract structures and generalizing to new contexts), and Learning from Experience (adapting through accumulated exploration and feedback). We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across the three learning dimensions and identify several insightful findings, such as (i) interaction improves learning; (ii) conceptual understanding is scale-emergent and benefits larger models; and (iii) LLMs are effective few-shot learners but not many-shot learners. Based on our framework and empirical findings, we introduce a benchmark that provides a unified and realistic evaluation of LLMs' general learning abilities across three learning cognition dimensions. It enables diagnostic insights and supports evaluation and development of more adaptive and human-like models.

  Long-term memory (LTM) is essential for large language models (LLMs) to achieve autonomous intelligence in complex, evolving environments. Despite increasing efforts in memory-augmented and retrieval-based architectures, there remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to systematically evaluate LLMs' long-term memory abilities. Existing benchmarks still face challenges in evaluating knowledge retention and dynamic sequential reasoning, and in their own flexibility, all of which limit their effectiveness in assessing models' LTM capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose a novel benchmark framework based on interactive fiction games, featuring dynamically branching storylines with complex reasoning structures. These structures simulate real-world scenarios by requiring LLMs to navigate hierarchical decision trees, where each choice triggers cascading dependencies across multi-turn interactions. Our benchmark emphasizes two distinct settings to test reasoning complexity: one with immediate feedback upon incorrect decisions, and the other requiring models to independently trace back and revise earlier choices after failure. As part of this benchmark, we also construct a new dataset designed to test LLMs' LTM within narrative-driven environments. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach through detailed experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the benchmark's ability to robustly and reliably assess LTM in LLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) are often constrained by rigid reasoning processes, limiting their ability to generate creative and diverse responses. To address this, a novel framework called LADDER is proposed, combining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and multi-dimensional up/down-sampling strategies which breaks the limitations of traditional LLMs. First, CoT reasoning guides the model through multi-step logical reasoning, expanding the semantic space and breaking the rigidity of thought. Next, MoE distributes the reasoning tasks across multiple expert modules, each focusing on specific sub-tasks. Finally, dimensionality reduction maps the reasoning outputs back to a lower-dimensional semantic space, yielding more precise and creative responses. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that LADDER significantly improves task completion, creativity, and fluency, generating innovative and coherent responses that outperform traditional models. Ablation studies reveal the critical roles of CoT and MoE in enhancing reasoning abilities and creative output. This work contributes to the development of more flexible and creative LLMs, capable of addressing complex and novel tasks.

  We present and evaluate a suite of proof-of-concept (PoC), structured workflow prompts designed to elicit human-like hierarchical reasoning while guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-level semantic and linguistic analysis of scholarly manuscripts. The prompts target two non-trivial analytical tasks: identifying unsubstantiated claims in summaries (informational integrity) and flagging ambiguous pronoun references (linguistic clarity). We conducted a systematic, multi-run evaluation on two frontier models (Gemini Pro 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3) under varied context conditions. Our results for the informational integrity task reveal a significant divergence in model performance: while both models successfully identified an unsubstantiated head of a noun phrase (95% success), ChatGPT consistently failed (0% success) to identify an unsubstantiated adjectival modifier that Gemini correctly flagged (95% success), raising a question regarding potential influence of the target's syntactic role. For the linguistic analysis task, both models performed well (80-90% success) with full manuscript context. In a summary-only setting, however, ChatGPT achieved a perfect (100%) success rate, while Gemini's performance was substantially degraded. Our findings suggest that structured prompting is a viable methodology for complex textual analysis but show that prompt performance may be highly dependent on the interplay between the model, task type, and context, highlighting the need for rigorous, model-specific testing.

  Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as the core of agent frameworks in various scenarios, such as social simulations and AI companions. However, the extent to which they can replicate human-like motivations remains an underexplored question. Existing benchmarks are constrained by simplistic scenarios and the absence of character identities, resulting in an information asymmetry with real-world situations. To address this gap, we propose MotiveBench, which consists of 200 rich contextual scenarios and 600 reasoning tasks covering multiple levels of motivation. Using MotiveBench, we conduct extensive experiments on seven popular model families, comparing different scales and versions within each family. The results show that even the most advanced LLMs still fall short in achieving human-like motivational reasoning. Our analysis reveals key findings, including the difficulty LLMs face in reasoning about "love & belonging" motivations and their tendency toward excessive rationality and idealism. These insights highlight a promising direction for future research on the humanization of LLMs. The dataset, benchmark, and code are available atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive translation capabilities even without being explicitly trained on parallel data. This remarkable property has led some to believe that parallel data is no longer necessary for building multilingual language models. While some attribute this to the emergent abilities of LLMs due to scale, recent work suggests that it is actually caused by incidental bilingual signals present in the training data. Various methods have been proposed to maximize the utility of parallel data to enhance the multilingual capabilities of multilingual encoder-based and encoder-decoder language models. However, some decoder-based LLMs opt to ignore parallel data instead. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on the impact of adding parallel data on LLMs' multilingual capabilities, focusing specifically on translation and multilingual common-sense reasoning. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that parallel data can significantly improve LLMs' multilingual capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Realignment becomes necessary when a language model (LM) fails to meet expected performance. We propose a flexible realignment framework that supports quantitative control of alignment degree during training and inference. This framework incorporates Training-time Realignment (TrRa), which efficiently realigns the reference model by leveraging the controllable fusion of logits from both the reference and already aligned models. For example, TrRa reduces token usage by 54.63% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B without any performance degradation, outperforming DeepScaleR-1.5B's 33.86%. To complement TrRa during inference, we introduce a layer adapter that enables smooth Inference-time Realignment (InRa). This adapter is initialized to perform an identity transformation at the bottom layer and is inserted preceding the original layers. During inference, input embeddings are simultaneously processed by the adapter and the original layer, followed by the remaining layers, and then controllably interpolated at the logit level. We upgraded DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from a slow-thinking model to one that supports both fast and slow thinking, allowing flexible alignment control even during inference. By encouraging deeper reasoning, it even surpassed its original performance.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential for advancing fact-checking by leveraging their capabilities in reasoning, evidence retrieval, and explanation generation. However, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate LLMs and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in realistic misinformation scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RealFactBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the fact-checking capabilities of LLMs and MLLMs across diverse real-world tasks, including Knowledge Validation, Rumor Detection, and Event Verification. RealFactBench consists of 6K high-quality claims drawn from authoritative sources, encompassing multimodal content and diverse domains. Our evaluation framework further introduces the Unknown Rate (UnR) metric, enabling a more nuanced assessment of models' ability to handle uncertainty and balance between over-conservatism and over-confidence. Extensive experiments on 7 representative LLMs and 4 MLLMs reveal their limitations in real-world fact-checking and offer valuable insights for further research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While recent advances in large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable performance, efficient reasoning remains critical due to the rapid growth of output length. Existing optimization approaches highlights a tendency toward "overthinking", yet lack fine-grained analysis. In this work, we focus on Self-Affirmation Reflections: redundant reflective steps that affirm prior content and often occurs after the already correct reasoning steps. Observations of both original and optimized reasoning models reveal pervasive self-affirmation reflections. Notably, these reflections sometimes lead to longer outputs in optimized models than their original counterparts. Through detailed analysis, we uncover an intriguing pattern: compared to other reflections, the leading words (i.e., the first word of sentences) in self-affirmation reflections exhibit a distinct probability bias. Motivated by this insight, we can locate self-affirmation reflections and conduct a train-free experiment demonstrating that suppressing self-affirmation reflections reduces output length without degrading accuracy across multiple models (R1-Distill-Models, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3-32B). Furthermore, we also improve current train-based method by explicitly suppressing such reflections. In our experiments, we achieve length compression of 18.7\% in train-free settings and 50.2\% in train-based settings for R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Moreover, our improvements are simple yet practical and can be directly applied to existing inference frameworks, such as vLLM. We believe that our findings will provide community insights for achieving more precise length compression and step-level efficient reasoning.

  Medical Question-Answering (QA) encompasses a broad spectrum of tasks, including multiple choice questions (MCQ), open-ended text generation, and complex computational reasoning. Despite this variety, a unified framework for delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1 demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. The code will be released.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday applications. As their influence grows, understanding their decision making and underlying personality becomes essential. In this work, we interpret model personality using our proposed Supernova Event Dataset, a novel dataset with diverse articles spanning biographies, historical events, news, and scientific discoveries. We use this dataset to benchmark LLMs on extracting and ranking key events from text, a subjective and complex challenge that requires reasoning over long-range context and modeling causal chains. We evaluate small models like Phi-4, Orca 2, and Qwen 2.5, and large, stronger models such as Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and OpenAI o3, and propose a framework where another LLM acts as a judge to infer each model's personality based on its selection and classification of events. Our analysis shows distinct personality traits: for instance, Orca 2 demonstrates emotional reasoning focusing on interpersonal dynamics, while Qwen 2.5 displays a more strategic, analytical style. When analyzing scientific discovery events, Claude Sonnet 3.7 emphasizes conceptual framing, Gemini 2.5 Pro prioritizes empirical validation, and o3 favors step-by-step causal reasoning. This analysis improves model interpretability, making them user-friendly for a wide range of diverse applications.

  The recent advent of reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 was met with excited speculation by the AI community about the mechanisms underlying these capabilities in closed models, followed by a rush of replication efforts, particularly from the open source community. These speculations were largely settled by the demonstration from DeepSeek-R1 that chains-of-thought and reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively replicate reasoning on top of base LLMs. However, it remains valuable to explore alternative methods for theoretically eliciting reasoning that could help elucidate the underlying mechanisms, as well as providing additional methods that may offer complementary benefits.Here, we build on the long-standing literature in cognitive psychology and cognitive architectures, which postulates that reasoning arises from the orchestrated, sequential execution of a set of modular, predetermined cognitive operations. Crucially, we implement this key idea within a modern agentic tool-calling framework. In particular, we endow an LLM with a small set of "cognitive tools" encapsulating specific reasoning operations, each executed by the LLM itself. Surprisingly, this simple strategy results in considerable gains in performance on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to base LLMs, for both closed and open-weight models. For instance, providing our "cognitive tools" to GPT-4.1 increases its pass@1 performance on AIME2024 from 26.7% to 43.3%, bringing it very close to the performance of o1-preview.In addition to its practical implications, this demonstration contributes to the debate regarding the role of post-training methods in eliciting reasoning in LLMs versus the role of inherent capabilities acquired during pre-training, and whether post-training merely uncovers these latent abilities.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive progress in mathematical reasoning. While data augmentation is promising to enhance mathematical problem-solving ability, current approaches are predominantly limited to instance-level modifications-such as rephrasing or generating syntactic variations-which fail to capture and leverage the intrinsic relational structures inherent in mathematical knowledge. Inspired by human learning processes, where mathematical proficiency develops through systematic exposure to interconnected concepts, we introduce MathFusion, a novel framework that enhances mathematical reasoning through cross-problem instruction synthesis. MathFusion implements this through three fusion strategies: (1) sequential fusion, which chains related problems to model solution dependencies; (2) parallel fusion, which combines analogous problems to reinforce conceptual understanding; and (3) conditional fusion, which creates context-aware selective problems to enhance reasoning flexibility. By applying these strategies, we generate a new dataset, \textbf{MathFusionQA}, followed by fine-tuning models (DeepSeekMath-7B, Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B) on it. Experimental results demonstrate that MathFusion achieves substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning while maintaining high data efficiency, boosting performance by 18.0 points in accuracy across diverse benchmarks while requiring only 45K additional synthetic instructions, representing a substantial improvement over traditional single-instruction approaches. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Recent studies have shown that increasing test-time computation enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This typically involves extensive sampling at inference time guided by an external LLM verifier, resulting in a two-player system. Despite external guidance, the effectiveness of this system demonstrates the potential of a single LLM to tackle complex tasks. Thus, we pose a new research problem: Can we internalize the searching capabilities to fundamentally enhance the reasoning abilities of a single LLM? This work explores an orthogonal direction focusing on post-training LLMs for autoregressive searching (i.e., an extended reasoning process with self-reflection and self-exploration of new strategies). To achieve this, we propose the Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT) reasoning and a two-stage training paradigm: 1) a small-scale format tuning stage to internalize the COAT reasoning format and 2) a large-scale self-improvement stage leveraging reinforcement learning. Our approach results in Satori, a 7B LLM trained on open-source models and data. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Satori achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while exhibits strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks. Code, data, and models are fully open-sourced.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a dataset of natural-language questions in the decision theory of so-called Newcomb-like problems. Newcomb-like problems include, for instance, decision problems in which an agent interacts with a similar other agent, and thus has to reason about the fact that the other agent will likely reason in similar ways. Evaluating LLM reasoning about Newcomb-like problems is important because interactions between foundation-model-based agents will often be Newcomb-like. Some ways of reasoning about Newcomb-like problems may allow for greater cooperation between models.Our dataset contains both capabilities questions (i.e., questions with a unique, uncontroversially correct answer) and attitude questions (i.e., questions about which decision theorists would disagree). We use our dataset for an investigation of decision-theoretical capabilities and expressed attitudes and their interplay in existing models (different models by OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, GDM, Reka, etc.), as well as models under simple prompt-based interventions. We find, among other things, that attitudes vary significantly between existing models; that high capabilities are associated with attitudes more favorable toward so-called evidential decision theory; and that attitudes are consistent across different types of questions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Interpretation is critical for disease diagnosis, but existing models struggle to balance predictive accuracy with human-understandable rationales. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities, their clinical use is limited by high computational costs and restricted multimodal reasoning ability. Small language models (SLMs) are efficient but lack advanced reasoning for integrating multimodal medical data. In addition, both LLMs and SLMs lack domain knowledge for trustworthy reasoning. Therefore, we propose ClinRaGen, enhancing SLMs by leveraging LLM-derived reasoning ability via rationale distillation and domain knowledge injection for trustworthy multimodal rationale generation. Key innovations include a sequential rationale distillation framework that equips SLMs with LLM-comparable multimodal reasoning abilities, and a knowledge-augmented attention mechanism that jointly unifies multimodal representation from time series and textual data in the same encoding space, enabling it to be naturally interpreted by SLMs while incorporating domain knowledge for reliable rationale generation. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that ClinRaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in disease diagnosis and rationale generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLM-driven reasoning with knowledge augmentation for improved interpretability.

Recent studies use Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task, exploiting their capability in understanding the questions and tabular data, which are typically given in natural language and contain many textual fields, respectively. While this approach has shown promising results, it overlooks the challenges brought by numerical values which are common in tabular data, and LLMs are known to struggle with such values. We aim to address this issue, and we propose a model named TabLaP that uses LLMs as a planner rather than an answer generator. This approach exploits LLMs' capability in multi-step reasoning while leaving the actual numerical calculations to a Python interpreter for accurate calculation. Recognizing the inaccurate nature of LLMs, we further make a first attempt to quantify the trustworthiness of the answers produced by TabLaP, such that users can use TabLaP in a regret-aware manner. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that TabLaP is substantially more accurate than the state-of-the-art models, improving the answer accuracy by 5.7% and 5.8% on the two datasets, respectively.

  Current research in LLM-based simulation systems lacks comprehensive solutions for modeling real-world court proceedings, while existing legal language models struggle with dynamic courtroom interactions. We present AgentCourt, a comprehensive legal simulation framework that addresses these challenges through adversarial evolution of LLM-based agents. Our AgentCourt introduces a new adversarial evolutionary approach for agents called AdvEvol, which performs dynamic knowledge learning and evolution through structured adversarial interactions in a simulated courtroom program, breaking the limitations of the traditional reliance on static knowledge bases or manual annotations. By simulating 1,000 civil cases, we construct an evolving knowledge base that enhances the agents' legal reasoning abilities. The evolved lawyer agents demonstrated outstanding performance on our newly introduced CourtBench benchmark, achieving a 12.1% improvement in performance compared to the original lawyer agents. Evaluations by professional lawyers confirm the effectiveness of our approach across three critical dimensions: cognitive agility, professional knowledge, and logical rigor. Beyond outperforming specialized legal models in interactive reasoning tasks, our findings emphasize the importance of adversarial learning in legal AI and suggest promising directions for extending simulation-based legal reasoning to broader judicial and regulatory contexts.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A compelling portrayal of characters is essential to the success of narrative writing. For readers, appreciating a character's traits requires the ability to infer their evolving beliefs, desires, and intentions over the course of a complex storyline, a cognitive skill known as Theory-of-Mind (ToM). Performing ToM reasoning in prolonged narratives requires readers to integrate historical context with current narrative information, a task at which humans excel but Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle. To systematically evaluate LLMs' ToM reasoning capability in long narratives, we construct LitCharToM, a benchmark of character-centric questions across four ToM dimensions from classic literature. Further, we introduce EvolvTrip, a perspective-aware temporal knowledge graph that tracks psychological development throughout narratives. Our experiments demonstrate that EvolvTrip consistently enhances performance of LLMs across varying scales, even in challenging extended-context scenarios. EvolvTrip proves to be particularly valuable for smaller models, partially bridging the performance gap with larger LLMs and showing great compatibility with lengthy narratives. Our findings highlight the importance of explicit representation of temporal character mental states in narrative comprehension and offer a foundation for more sophisticated character understanding. Our data and code are publicly available atthis https URL.

  As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, reliable evaluation methods are essential particularly for open-ended, instruction-following tasks. LLM-as-a-Judge enables automatic evaluation using LLMs as evaluators, but its reliability remains uncertain. In this work, we analyze key factors affecting its trustworthiness, focusing on alignment with human judgments and evaluation consistency. Using BIGGENBench and EvalBiasBench, we study the effects of evaluation design, decoding strategies, and Chain-of-Tought (CoT) reasoning in evaluation. Our results show that evaluation criteria are critical for reliability, non-deterministic sampling improves alignment with human preferences over deterministic evaluation, and CoT reasoning offers minimal gains when clear evaluation criteria are present.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained via next-word prediction (NWP), which provides strong surface-level fluency but often lacks support for robust reasoning. We propose BOttlenecked next Word exploration (BOW), a novel RL framework that rethinks NWP by introducing a reasoning bottleneck where a policy model first generates a reasoning path rather than predicting the next token directly, after which a frozen judge model predicts the next token distribution based solely on this reasoning path. We train the policy model using GRPO with rewards that quantify how effectively the reasoning path facilitates next-word recovery. Compared with other continual pretraining baselines, we show that BOW improves both the general and next-word reasoning capabilities of the base model, evaluated on various benchmarks. Our findings show that BOW can serve as an effective and scalable alternative to vanilla NWP.

  With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an increasing need for challenging benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities in handling complex tabular data. However, existing benchmarks are either based on outdated data setups or focus solely on simple, flat table structures. In this paper, we introduce RealHiTBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of both LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) across a variety of input formats for complex tabular data, including LaTeX, HTML, and PNG. RealHiTBench also includes a diverse collection of tables with intricate structures, spanning a wide range of task types. Our experimental results, using 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrate that RealHiTBench is indeed a challenging benchmark. Moreover, we also develop TreeThinker, a tree-based pipeline that organizes hierarchical headers into a tree structure for enhanced tabular reasoning, validating the importance of improving LLMs' perception of table hierarchies. We hope that our work will inspire further research on tabular data reasoning and the development of more robust models. The code and data are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text generation and understanding, yet their reliance on implicit, unstructured knowledge often leads to factual inaccuracies and limited interpretability. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), with their structured, relational representations, offer a promising solution to ground LLMs in verified knowledge. However, their potential remains constrained by inherent noise, incompleteness, and the complexity of integrating their rigid structure with the flexible reasoning of LLMs. This thesis presents a systematic framework to address these limitations, advancing the reliability of KGs and their synergistic integration with LLMs through five interconnected contributions. This thesis addresses these challenges through a cohesive framework that enhances LLMs by refining and leveraging reliable KGs. First, we introduce contrastive error detection, a structure-based method to identify incorrect facts in KGs. This approach is extended by an attribute-aware framework that unifies structural and semantic signals for error correction. Next, we propose an inductive completion model that further refines KGs by completing the missing relationships in evolving KGs. Building on these refined KGs, KnowGPT integrates structured graph reasoning into LLMs through dynamic prompting, improving factual grounding. These contributions form a systematic pipeline (from error detection to LLM integration), demonstrating that reliable KGs significantly enhance the robustness, interpretability, and adaptability of LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate significant cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, financial applications face challenges due to the lack of high-quality multimodal reasoning datasets and the inefficiency of existing training paradigms for reasoning enhancement. To address these issues, we propose an integrated framework, FinLMM-R1, combining an automated and scalable pipeline for data construction with enhanced training strategies to improve the multimodal reasoning of LMM. The Automated and Scalable Pipeline (ASP) resolves textual-visual misalignment in financial reports through a separate paradigm of question-answer generation and image-question alignment, ensuring data integrity and extraction efficiency. Through ASP, we collect 89,378 aligned image-question pairs from 23,397 financial reports, covering tasks such as arithmetic reasoning, statistics reasoning, financial explanation, and financial knowledge. Moreover, we introduce the Thinking with Adversarial Reward in LMM (TAR-LMM), extending the prior two-stage training framework [1] with additional reward mechanisms. In the first stage, we focus on text-only tasks with format and accuracy rewards to guide the model in generating well-structured thinking contents. In the second stage, we construct multi-image contrastive samples with additional reward components including image selection, thinking content length, and adversarial reward to jointly optimize the LMM across visual perception, reasoning efficiency, and logical coherence. Extensive experiments on 7 benchmarks show ASP-derived dataset and training framework significantly improve answer accuracy and reasoning depth over existing reasoning LMMs in both general and financial multimodal contexts.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Media outlets are becoming more partisan and polarized nowadays. Most previous work focused on detecting media bias. In this paper, we aim to mitigate media bias by generating a neutralized summary given multiple articles presenting different ideological views. Motivated by the critical role of events and event relations in media bias detection, we propose to increase awareness of bias in LLMs via multi-document events reasoning and use a multi-document event relation graph to guide the summarization process. This graph contains rich event information useful to reveal bias: four common types of in-doc event relations to reflect content framing bias, cross-doc event coreference relation to reveal content selection bias, and event-level moral opinions to highlight opinionated framing bias. We further develop two strategies to incorporate the multi-document event relation graph for neutralized summarization. Firstly, we convert a graph into natural language descriptions and feed the textualized graph into LLMs as a part of a hard text prompt. Secondly, we encode the graph with graph attention network and insert the graph embedding into LLMs as a soft prompt. Both automatic evaluation and human evaluation confirm that our approach effectively mitigates both lexical and informational media bias, and meanwhile improves content preservation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid improvement in the general capabilities of LLMs, LLM personalization, i.e., how to build LLM systems that can generate personalized responses or services that are tailored to distinct user personas, has become an increasingly important research and engineering problem. However, unlike many new challenging benchmarks being released for evaluating the general/reasoning capabilities, the lack of high-quality benchmarks for evaluating LLM personalization greatly hinders progress in this field. To address this, we introduce PersonaFeedback, a new benchmark that directly evaluates LLMs' ability to provide personalized responses given pre-defined user personas and queries. Unlike existing benchmarks that require models to infer implicit user personas from historical interactions, PersonaFeedback decouples persona inference from personalization, focusing on evaluating the model's ability to generate responses tailored to explicit personas. PersonaFeedback consists of 8298 human-annotated test cases, which are categorized into easy, medium, and hard tiers based on the contextual complexity of the user personas and the difficulty in distinguishing subtle differences between two personalized responses. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a wide range of models. The empirical results reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs that can solve complex real-world reasoning tasks could fall short on the hard tier of PersonaFeedback where even human evaluators may find the distinctions challenging. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of failure modes across various types of systems, demonstrating that the current retrieval-augmented framework should not be seen as a de facto solution for personalization tasks. All benchmark data, annotation protocols, and the evaluation pipeline will be publicly available to facilitate future research on LLM personalization.

  Advancement in Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning capabilities enables them to solve scientific problems with enhanced efficacy. Thereby, a high-quality benchmark for comprehensive and appropriate assessment holds significance, while existing ones either confront the risk of data contamination or lack involved disciplines. To be specific, due to the data source overlap of LLMs training and static benchmark, the keys or number pattern of answers inadvertently memorized (i.e. data contamination), leading to systematic overestimation of their reasoning capabilities, especially numerical reasoning. We propose SciDA, a multidisciplinary benchmark that consists exclusively of over 1k Olympic-level numerical computation problems, allowing randomized numerical initializations for each inference round to avoid reliance on fixed numerical patterns. We conduct a series of experiments with both closed-source and open-source top-performing LLMs, and it is observed that the performance of LLMs drop significantly under random numerical initialization. Thus, we provide truthful and unbiased assessments of the numerical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The data is available atthis https URL

  As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in morally sensitive domains, it is crucial to understand how persona traits affect their moral reasoning and persuasive behavior. We present the first large-scale study of multi-dimensional persona effects in AI-AI debates over real-world moral dilemmas. Using a 6-dimensional persona space (age, gender, country, class, ideology, and personality), we simulate structured debates between AI agents over 131 relationship-based cases. Our results show that personas affect initial moral stances and debate outcomes, with political ideology and personality traits exerting the strongest influence. Persuasive success varies across traits, with liberal and open personalities reaching higher consensus and win rates. While logit-based confidence grows during debates, emotional and credibility-based appeals diminish, indicating more tempered argumentation over time. These trends mirror findings from psychology and cultural studies, reinforcing the need for persona-aware evaluation frameworks for AI moral reasoning.

  In this work we focus on improving language models' understanding for asset maintenance to guide the engineer's decisions and minimize asset downtime. Given a set of tasks expressed in natural language for Industry 4.0 domain, each associated with queries related to a specific asset, we want to recommend relevant items and generalize to queries of similar assets. A task may involve identifying relevant sensors given a query about an asset's failure mode.Our approach begins with gathering a qualitative, expert-vetted knowledge base to construct nine asset-specific task datasets. To create more contextually informed embeddings, we augment the input tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs), providing concise descriptions of the entities involved in the queries. This embedding model is then integrated with a Reasoning and Acting agent (ReAct), which serves as a powerful tool for answering complex user queries that require multi-step reasoning, planning, and knowledge inference.Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that: (a) LLM query augmentation improves the quality of embeddings, (b) Contrastive loss and other methods that avoid in-batch negatives are superior for datasets with queries related to many items, and (c) It is crucial to balance positive and negative in-batch samples. After training and testing on our dataset, we observe a substantial improvement: HIT@1 increases by +54.2%, MAP@100 by +50.1%, and NDCG@10 by +54.7%, averaged across all tasks and models. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate the model's planning and tool invocation capabilities when answering complex questions related to industrial asset maintenance, showcasing its effectiveness in supporting Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in their day-to-day operations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress on reasoning tasks involving unstructured text, yet their capabilities significantly deteriorate when reasoning requires integrating structured external knowledge such as knowledge graphs, code snippets, or formal logic. This limitation is partly due to the absence of benchmarks capable of systematically evaluating LLM performance across diverse structured knowledge modalities. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{\textsc{OneEval}}, a comprehensive benchmark explicitly designed to assess the knowledge-intensive reasoning capabilities of LLMs across four structured knowledge modalities, unstructured text, knowledge graphs, code, and formal logic, and five critical domains (general knowledge, government, science, law, and programming). \textsc{OneEval} comprises 4,019 carefully curated instances and includes a challenging subset, \textsc{OneEval}\textsubscript{Hard}, consisting of 1,285 particularly difficult cases. Through extensive evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, we establish three core findings: a) \emph{persistent limitations in structured reasoning}, with even the strongest model achieving only 32.2\% accuracy on \textsc{OneEval}\textsubscript{Hard}; b) \emph{performance consistently declines as the structural complexity of the knowledge base increases}, with accuracy dropping sharply from 53\% (textual reasoning) to 25\% (formal logic); and c) \emph{diminishing returns from extended reasoning chains}, highlighting the critical need for models to adapt reasoning depth appropriately to task complexity. We release the \textsc{OneEval} datasets, evaluation scripts, and baseline results publicly, accompanied by a leaderboard to facilitate ongoing advancements in structured knowledge reasoning.

  With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), they have significantly improved efficiency across a wide range of domains. However, recent studies have revealed that LLMs often exhibit gender bias, leading to serious social implications. Detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias in LLMs has therefore become a critical research focus. In the NLPCC 2025 Shared Task 7: Chinese Corpus for Gender Bias Detection, Classification and Mitigation Challenge, we investigate how to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in gender bias detection, classification, and mitigation. We adopt reinforcement learning, chain-of-thoughts (CoT) reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning to handle different Subtasks. Specifically, for Subtasks 1 and 2, we leverage the internal reasoning capabilities of LLMs to guide multi-step thinking in a staged manner, which simplifies complex biased queries and improves response accuracy. For Subtask 3, we employ a reinforcement learning-based approach, annotating a preference dataset using GPT-4. We then apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate gender bias by introducing a loss function that explicitly favors less biased completions over biased ones. Our approach ranked first across all three subtasks of the NLPCC 2025 Shared Task 7.

  Inference-time alignment methods have gained significant attention for their efficiency and effectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, existing dominant approaches using reward-guided search (RGS) primarily rely on outcome reward models (ORMs), which suffer from a critical granularity mismatch: ORMs are designed to provide outcome rewards for complete responses, while RGS methods rely on process rewards to guide the policy, leading to inconsistent scoring and suboptimal alignment. To address this challenge, we introduce process reward models (PRMs) into RGS and argue that an ideal PRM should satisfy two objectives: Score Consistency, ensuring coherent evaluation across partial and complete responses, and Preference Consistency, aligning partial sequence assessments with human preferences. Based on these, we propose SP-PRM, a novel dual-consistency framework integrating score consistency-based and preference consistency-based partial evaluation modules without relying on human annotation. Extensive experiments on dialogue, summarization, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that SP-PRM substantially enhances existing RGS methods, achieving a 3.6%-10.3% improvement in GPT-4 evaluation scores across all tasks.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in medical question answering (MedQA), yet adapting them to biomedical reasoning remains challenging due to domain-specific complexity and limited supervision. In this work, we study how prompt design and lightweight fine-tuning affect the performance of open-source LLMs on PubMedQA, a benchmark for multiple-choice biomedical questions. We focus on two widely used prompting strategies - standard instruction prompts and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts - and apply QLoRA for parameter-efficient instruction tuning. Across multiple model families and sizes, our experiments show that CoT prompting alone can improve reasoning in zero-shot settings, while instruction tuning significantly boosts accuracy. However, fine-tuning on CoT prompts does not universally enhance performance and may even degrade it for certain larger models. These findings suggest that reasoning-aware prompts are useful, but their benefits are model- and scale-dependent. Our study offers practical insights into combining prompt engineering with efficient finetuning for medical QA applications.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled impressive performance in various tasks.

We further show that multilingual fine-tuning simultaneously improves cross-language generalization performance. Our results highlight the effectiveness of explicit reasoning steps in LLM-based parsing and offer a scalable, format-consistent alternative to bracket-based approaches.

  Extracting structured computational representations of historical events from narrative text remains computationally expensive when constructed manually. While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4 extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2 shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification, temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than ontological violations.

  Images usually convey richer detail than text, but often include redundant information which potentially downgrades multimodal reasoning performance. When faced with lengthy or complex messages, humans tend to employ abstract thinking to convert them into simple and concise abstracts. Inspired by this cognitive strategy, we introduce Visual Abstract Thinking (VAT), a novel thinking paradigm that prompts Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with visual abstract instead of explicit verbal thoughts or elaborate guidance, permitting a more concentrated visual reasoning mechanism. Explicit thinking, such as Chain-of-thought (CoT) or tool-augmented approaches, increases the complexity of reasoning process via inserting verbose intermediate steps, external knowledge or visual information. In contrast, VAT reduces redundant visual information and encourages models to focus their reasoning on more essential visual elements. Experimental results show that VAT consistently empowers different models, and achieves an average gain of 17% over GPT-4o baseline by employing diverse types of visual abstracts, demonstrating that VAT can enhance visual reasoning abilities for MLLMs regarding conceptual, structural and relational reasoning tasks. VAT is also compatible with CoT in knowledge-intensive multimodal reasoning tasks. These findings highlight the effectiveness of visual reasoning via abstract thinking and encourage further exploration of more diverse reasoning paradigms from the perspective of human cognition.

  Processing structured tabular data, particularly large and lengthy tables, constitutes a fundamental yet challenging task for large language models (LLMs). However, existing long-context benchmarks like Needle-in-a-Haystack primarily focus on unstructured text, neglecting the challenge of diverse structured tables. Meanwhile, previous tabular benchmarks mainly consider downstream tasks that require high-level reasoning abilities, and overlook models' underlying fine-grained perception of individual table cells, which is crucial for practical and robust LLM-based table applications. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{NeedleInATable} (NIAT), a new long-context tabular benchmark that treats each table cell as a ``needle'' and requires models to extract the target cell based on cell locations or lookup questions. Our comprehensive evaluation of various LLMs and multimodal LLMs reveals a substantial performance gap between popular downstream tabular tasks and the simpler NIAT task, suggesting that they may rely on dataset-specific correlations or shortcuts to obtain better benchmark results but lack truly robust long-context understanding towards structured tables. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using synthesized NIAT training data can effectively improve performance on both NIAT task and downstream tabular tasks, which validates the importance of NIAT capability for LLMs' genuine table understanding ability. Our data, code and models will be released to facilitate future research.

  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) significantly improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning to reason, exhibiting promising performance in complex task-solving. However, their deliberative reasoning process leads to inefficiencies in token usage, memory consumption, and inference time. Thus, this survey provides a review of efficient inference methods designed specifically for LRMs, focusing on mitigating token inefficiency while preserving the reasoning quality. First, we introduce a taxonomy to group the recent methods into two main categories: (a) explicit compact Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which reduces tokens while keeping the explicit reasoning structure, and (b) implicit latent CoT, which encodes reasoning steps within hidden representations instead of explicit tokens. Meanwhile, we discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we conduct empirical analyses on existing methods from performance and efficiency aspects. Besides, we present open challenges in this field, including human-centric controllable reasoning, trade-off between interpretability and efficiency of reasoning, ensuring safety of efficient reasoning, and broader applications of efficient reasoning. In addition, we highlight key insights for enhancing LRMs' inference efficiency via techniques such as model merging, new architectures, and agent routers. We hope this work serves as a valuable guide, helping researchers overcome challenges in this vibrant field\footnote{this https URL}.

By incorporating a constrained action space, Process Reward Model (PRM), and partial order rules, CMCTS effectively addresses the limitations of existing MCTS methods in terms of state space diversity and action selection rationality. Specifically, during the expansion phase, CMCTS restricts action sampling to a predefined constrained action set to increase candidate state diversity. In the simulation phase, it introduces partial order rules and PRM to optimize action selection and prevent unreasonable state transitions. Experimental results show that CMCTS performs outstandingly across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Under a zero-shot setting, a 7B-parameter model achieves an average accuracy of 83.4\%, surpassing the 72B baseline model by 4.8\%. Ablation studies demonstrate that each component of the framework is crucial for performance improvement, and their combined use fully leverages their respective strengths. Overall, the CMCTS framework provides an effective approach to enhancing LLM mathematical reasoning capabilities, supported by theoretical analysis, and offers novel insights for future reasoning tasks.

  As the fundamental capability behind decision-making in finance, financial reasoning poses distinct challenges for LLMs. Although reinforcement learning (RL) have boosted generic reasoning, the progress in finance is hindered by the absence of empirical study of building effective financial chain-of-thought (CoT) corpus, a systematic comparison of different RL methods, and comprehensive benchmarks. To address these gaps, we introduce FinCoT, the first open high-fidelity CoT corpus for finance, distilled from seven QA datasets by a novel three-stage pipeline that incorporates domain supervision, iterative LLM refinement, and difficulty-aware filtering. Based on FinCoT, we develop Fin-o1, the first open financial reasoning models trained via supervised fine-tuning and GRPO-based RL. Our models outperform existing financial reasoning models and SOTA general models such as GPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and GPT-4.5. We also investigate the effectiveness of three different RL methods in improving domain-specific reasoning, offering the first such empirical study. We finally propose FinReason, the first financial reasoning benchmark covering multi-table analysis, long-context reasoning, and equation-based tasks, and evaluate 29 LLMs. Our extensive experiments reveal general reasoning models excel on standard benchmarks yet exhibit obvious performance degradation in financial contexts; even finance-tuned models like Dianjin-R1 and FinR1 degrade on lengthy documents. In contrast, our Fin-o1 models consistently outperform their backbones and larger GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, confirming the effectiveness of our data building and model training strategy. Our study further shows that GRPO yields reliable gains whereas PPO and DPO do not, highlighting the need for targeted data and optimisation rather than scale alone.

  Current inference scaling methods, such as Self-consistency and Best-of-N, have proven effective in improving the accuracy of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks. However, these methods rely heavily on the quality of candidate responses and are unable to produce correct answers when all candidates are incorrect. In this paper, we propose a novel inference scaling strategy, CoT-based Synthesizer, which leverages CoT reasoning to synthesize superior answers by analyzing complementary information from multiple candidate responses, even when all candidate responses are flawed. To enable a lightweight and cost-effective implementation, we introduce an automated data generation pipeline that creates diverse training data. This allows smaller LLMs trained on this data to improve the inference accuracy of larger models, including API-based LLMs. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets with seven policy models demonstrate that our method significantly enhances performance, with gains of 11.8% for Llama3-8B and 10.3% for GPT-4o on the MATH dataset. The corresponding training data and code are publicly available onthis https URL.

  The reranker and generator are two critical components in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (i.e., RAG) pipeline, responsible for ranking relevant documents and generating responses. However, due to differences in pre-training data and objectives, there is an inevitable gap between the documents ranked as relevant by the reranker and those required by the generator to support answering the query. To address this gap, we propose RADIO, a novel and practical preference alignment framework with RAtionale DIstillatiOn. Specifically, we first propose a rationale extraction method that leverages the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the rationales necessary for answering the query. Subsequently, a rationale-based alignment process is designed to rerank the documents based on the extracted rationales, and fine-tune the reranker to align the preferences. We conduct extensive experiments on two tasks across three datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to baseline methods. Our code is released online to ease reproduction.

  Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools for solving complex problems can grant them human-like reasoning abilities. ReAct and its variants are popular frameworks for tool use in both single-agent and multi-agent systems. To address issues like error propagation and limited exploration in ReAct, the Deep First Search Decision Tree (DFSDT) was proposed, but it faces challenges such as rollback instability, redundant context, and premature termination in single-agent settings. We introduce "Smurfs," a novel multi-agent system (MAS) that enhances DFSDT with a modular, context-efficient, and training-free design. Smurfs surpasses baseline methods in both the open-ended StableToolBench and the closed-ended HotpotQA tasks, reducing token usage by 60.9\% compared to DFSDT and enabling Mistral-7b to perform on par with GPT-4-DFSDT. Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of Smurfs' core components, offering valuable insights for the construction and interpretation of MAS, and paving the way for future exploration.

  Current Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodologies for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on simplistic, outcome-based reward signals (e.g., final answer correctness), which limits the depth of learning from each interaction. This paper introduces Socratic Reinforcement Learning (Socratic-RL), a novel, process-oriented framework designed to address this limitation. Socratic-RL operates on the principle that deeper understanding is achieved by reflecting on the causal reasons for errors and successes within the reasoning process itself. The framework employs a decoupled "Teacher-Student" architecture, where a "Teacher AI" analyzes interaction histories, extracts causal insights, and formulates them into structured "viewpoints." These viewpoints, acting as distilled guidance, are then used by a "Student AI" to enhance its subsequent reasoning. A key innovation is the iterative self-improvement of the Teacher AI, enabling its reflective capabilities to evolve through a meta-learning loop. To manage the accumulation of knowledge, a distillation mechanism compresses learned viewpoints into the Student's parameters. By focusing on process rather than just outcome, Socratic-RL presents a pathway toward enhanced sample efficiency, superior interpretability, and a more scalable architecture for self-improving AI systems. This paper details the foundational concepts, formal mechanisms, synergies, challenges, and a concrete research roadmap for this proposed framework.

  Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled strong chain-of-thought (CoT) generation through test-time computation. While these multi-step reasoning capabilities represent a major milestone in language model performance, they also introduce new safety risks. In this work, we present the first systematic study to revisit the problem of machine unlearning in the context of LRMs. Machine unlearning refers to the process of removing the influence of sensitive, harmful, or undesired data or knowledge from a trained model without full retraining. We show that conventional unlearning algorithms, originally designed for non-reasoning models, are inadequate for LRMs. In particular, even when final answers are successfully erased, sensitive information often persists within the intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., CoT trajectories. To address this challenge, we extend conventional unlearning and propose Reasoning-aware Representation Misdirection for Unlearning ($R^2MU$), a novel method that effectively suppresses sensitive reasoning traces and prevents the generation of associated final answers, while preserving the model's reasoning ability. Our experiments demonstrate that $R^2MU$ significantly reduces sensitive information leakage within reasoning traces and achieves strong performance across both safety and reasoning benchmarks, evaluated on state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have witnessed a surge in the development of advanced reasoning paradigms, which are now being integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and \textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

  Fact verification is essential for ensuring the reliability of LLM applications. In this study, we evaluate 12 pre-trained LLMs and one specialized fact-verifier, including frontier LLMs and open-weight reasoning LLMs, using a collection of examples from 14 fact-checking benchmarks. We share three findings intended to guide future development of more robust fact verifiers. First, we highlight the importance of addressing annotation errors and ambiguity in datasets, demonstrating that approximately 16\% of ambiguous or incorrectly labeled data substantially influences model rankings. Neglecting this issue may result in misleading conclusions during comparative evaluations, and we suggest using a systematic pipeline utilizing LLM-as-a-judge to help identify these issues at scale. Second, we discover that frontier LLMs with few-shot in-context examples, often overlooked in previous works, achieve top-tier performance. We therefore recommend future studies include comparisons with these simple yet highly effective baselines. Lastly, despite their effectiveness, frontier LLMs incur substantial costs, motivating the development of small, fine-tuned fact verifiers. We show that these small models still have room for improvement, particularly on instances that require complex reasoning. Encouragingly, we demonstrate that augmenting training with synthetic multi-hop reasoning data significantly enhances their capabilities in such instances.

  Precision process planning in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining demands rapid, context-aware decisions on tool selection, feed-speed pairs, and multi-axis routing, placing immense cognitive and procedural burdens on engineers from design specification through final part inspection. Conventional rule-based computer-aided process planning and knowledge-engineering shells freeze domain know-how into static tables, which become limited when dealing with unseen topologies, novel material states, shifting cost-quality-sustainability weightings, or shop-floor constraints such as tool unavailability and energy caps. Large language models (LLMs) promise flexible, instruction-driven reasoning for tasks but they routinely hallucinate numeric values and provide no provenance. We present Augmented Retrieval Knowledge Network Enhanced Search & Synthesis (ARKNESS), the end-to-end framework that fuses zero-shot Knowledge Graph (KG) construction with retrieval-augmented generation to deliver verifiable, numerically exact answers for CNC process planning. ARKNESS (1) automatically distills heterogeneous machining documents, G-code annotations, and vendor datasheets into augmented triple, multi-relational graphs without manual labeling, and (2) couples any on-prem LLM with a retriever that injects the minimal, evidence-linked subgraph needed to answer a query. Benchmarked on 155 industry-curated questions spanning tool sizing and feed-speed optimization, a lightweight 3B-parameter Llama-3 augmented by ARKNESS matches GPT-4o accuracy while achieving a +25 percentage point gain in multiple-choice accuracy, +22.4 pp in F1, and 8.1x ROUGE-L on open-ended responses.

  With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, increasing attention has been given to their social interaction and strategic reasoning capabilities. However, existing Werewolf-based benchmarking platforms suffer from overly simplified game settings, incomplete evaluation metrics, and poor scalability. To address these limitations, we propose WereWolf-Plus, a multi-model, multi-dimensional, and multi-method benchmarking platform for evaluating multi-agent strategic reasoning in the Werewolf game. The platform offers strong extensibility, supporting customizable configurations for roles such as Seer, Witch, Hunter, Guard, and Sheriff, along with flexible model assignment and reasoning enhancement strategies for different roles. In addition, we introduce a comprehensive set of quantitative evaluation metrics for all special roles, werewolves, and the sheriff, and enrich the assessment dimensions for agent reasoning ability, cooperation capacity, and social influence. WereWolf-Plus provides a more flexible and reliable environment for advancing research on inference and strategic interaction within multi-agent communities.

  Effective human-AI decision-making balances three key factors: the \textit{correctness} of predictions, the \textit{cost} of knowledge and reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to \textit{abstain} automated answers or involve human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over time. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results show that our cascaded strategy outperforms in most cases single-model baselines in accuracy while reducing cost and providing a principled way to handle abstentions.

  The reasoning steps generated by LLMs might be incomplete, as they mimic logical leaps common in everyday communication found in their pre-training data: underlying rationales are frequently left implicit (unstated). To address this challenge, we introduce RATIONALYST, a model for process-supervision of reasoning based on pre-training on a vast collection of rationale annotations extracted from unlabeled data. We extract 79k rationales from web-scale unlabelled dataset (the Pile) and a combination of reasoning datasets with minimal human intervention. This web-scale pre-training for reasoning allows RATIONALYST to consistently generalize across diverse reasoning tasks, including mathematical, commonsense, scientific, and logical reasoning. Fine-tuned from LLaMa-3-8B, RATIONALYST improves the accuracy of reasoning by an average of 3.9% on 7 representative reasoning benchmarks. It also demonstrates superior performance compared to significantly larger verifiers like GPT-4 and similarly sized models fine-tuned on matching training sets.

  Moral competence is the ability to act in accordance with moral principles. As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in situations demanding moral competence, there is increasing interest in evaluating this ability empirically. We review existing literature and identify three significant shortcoming: (i) Over-reliance on prepackaged moral scenarios with explicitly highlighted moral features; (ii) Focus on verdict prediction rather than moral reasoning; and (iii) Inadequate testing of models' (in)ability to recognize when additional information is needed. Grounded in philosophical research on moral skill, we then introduce a novel method for assessing moral competence in LLMs. Our approach moves beyond simple verdict comparisons to evaluate five dimensions of moral competence: identifying morally relevant features, weighting their importance, assigning moral reasons to these features, synthesizing coherent moral judgments, and recognizing information gaps. We conduct two experiments comparing six leading LLMs against non-expert humans and professional philosophers. In our first experiment using ethical vignettes standard to existing work, LLMs generally outperformed non-expert humans across multiple dimensions of moral reasoning. However, our second experiment, featuring novel scenarios designed to test moral sensitivity by embedding relevant features among irrelevant details, revealed a striking reversal: several LLMs performed significantly worse than humans. Our findings suggest that current evaluations may substantially overestimate LLMs' moral reasoning capabilities by eliminating the task of discerning moral relevance from noisy information, which we take to be a prerequisite for genuine moral skill. This work provides a more nuanced framework for assessing AI moral competence and highlights important directions for improving moral competence in advanced AI systems.

  The Da Vinci Code, a game of logical deduction and imperfect information, presents unique challenges for artificial intelligence, demanding nuanced reasoning beyond simple pattern recognition. This paper investigates the efficacy of various AI paradigms in mastering this game. We develop and evaluate three distinct agent architectures: a Transformer-based baseline model with limited historical context, several Large Language Model (LLM) agents (including Gemini, DeepSeek, and GPT variants) guided by structured prompts, and an agent based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) employing a Transformer encoder for comprehensive game history processing. Performance is benchmarked against the baseline, with the PPO-based agent demonstrating superior win rates ($58.5\% \pm 1.0\%$), significantly outperforming the LLM counterparts. Our analysis highlights the strengths of deep reinforcement learning in policy refinement for complex deductive tasks, particularly in learning implicit strategies from self-play. We also examine the capabilities and inherent limitations of current LLMs in maintaining strict logical consistency and strategic depth over extended gameplay, despite sophisticated prompting. This study contributes to the broader understanding of AI in recreational games involving hidden information and multi-step logical reasoning, offering insights into effective agent design and the comparative advantages of different AI approaches.

  Verifying the reliability of complex, multi-step reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge, as existing methods often lack both faithfulness and precision. To address this issue, we propose the Graph of Verification (GoV) framework. GoV offers three key contributions: First, it explicitly models the underlying deductive process as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), whether this structure is implicit or explicitly constructed. Second, it enforces a topological order over the DAG to guide stepwise verification. Third, GoV introduces the notion of customizable node blocks, which flexibly define the verification granularity, from atomic propositions to full paragraphs, while ensuring that all requisite premises derived from the graph are provided as contextual input for each verification unit. We evaluate GoV on the Number Triangle Summation task and the ProcessBench benchmark with varying levels of reasoning complexity. Experimental results show that GoV substantially improves verification accuracy, faithfulness, and error localization when compared to conventional end-to-end verification approaches.

  Recent advances in agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in solving complex tasks. However, most current methods lack mechanisms for coordinating specialized agents and have limited ability to generalize to new or diverse domains. We introduce \projectname, a hierarchical multi-agent framework for general-purpose task solving that integrates high-level planning with modular agent collaboration. Inspired by the way a conductor orchestrates a symphony and guided by the principles of \textit{extensibility}, \textit{multimodality}, \textit{modularity}, and \textit{coordination}, \projectname features a central planning agent that decomposes complex objectives and delegates sub-tasks to a team of specialized agents. Each sub-agent is equipped with general programming and analytical tools, as well as abilities to tackle a wide range of real-world specific tasks, including data analysis, file operations, web navigation, and interactive reasoning in dynamic multimodal environments. \projectname supports flexible orchestration through explicit sub-goal formulation, inter-agent communication, and adaptive role allocation. We evaluate the framework on three widely used benchmark datasets covering various real-world tasks, searching web pages, reasoning over heterogeneous modalities, etc. Experimental results demonstrate that \projectname consistently outperforms flat-agent and monolithic baselines in task success rate and adaptability. These findings highlight the effectiveness of hierarchical organization and role specialization in building scalable and general-purpose LLM-based agent systems.

  To effectively engage in human society, the ability to adapt, filter information, and make informed decisions in ever-changing situations is critical. As robots and intelligent agents become more integrated into human life, there is a growing opportunity-and need-to offload the cognitive burden on humans to these systems, particularly in dynamic, information-rich scenarios.To fill this critical need, we present Multi-RAG, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation system designed to provide adaptive assistance to humans in information-intensive circumstances. Our system aims to improve situational understanding and reduce cognitive load by integrating and reasoning over multi-source information streams, including video, audio, and text. As an enabling step toward long-term human-robot partnerships, Multi-RAG explores how multimodal information understanding can serve as a foundation for adaptive robotic assistance in dynamic, human-centered situations. To evaluate its capability in a realistic human-assistance proxy task, we benchmarked Multi-RAG on the MMBench-Video dataset, a challenging multimodal video understanding benchmark. Our system achieves superior performance compared to existing open-source video large language models (Video-LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs), while utilizing fewer resources and less input data. The results demonstrate Multi- RAG's potential as a practical and efficient foundation for future human-robot adaptive assistance systems in dynamic, real-world contexts.

  While large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning excel in mathematics and coding, their potential for systematic reasoning in chemistry, a domain demanding rigorous structural analysis for real-world tasks like drug design and reaction engineering, remains untapped. Current benchmarks focus on simple knowledge retrieval, neglecting step-by-step reasoning required for complex tasks such as molecular optimization and reaction prediction. To address this, we introduce ChemCoTBench, a reasoning framework that bridges molecular structure understanding with arithmetic-inspired operations, including addition, deletion, and substitution, to formalize chemical problem-solving into transparent, step-by-step workflows. By treating molecular transformations as modular "chemical operations", the framework enables slow-thinking reasoning, mirroring the logic of mathematical proofs while grounding solutions in real-world chemical constraints. We evaluate models on two high-impact tasks: Molecular Property Optimization and Chemical Reaction Prediction. These tasks mirror real-world challenges while providing structured evaluability. By providing annotated datasets, a reasoning taxonomy, and baseline evaluations, ChemCoTBench bridges the gap between abstract reasoning methods and practical chemical discovery, establishing a foundation for advancing LLMs as tools for AI-driven scientific innovation.

  One goal of AI (and AGI) is to identify and understand specific mechanisms and representations sufficient for general intelligence. Often, this work manifests in research focused on architectures and many cognitive architectures have been explored in AI/AGI. However, different research groups and even different research traditions have somewhat independently identified similar/common patterns of processes and representations or "cognitive design patterns" that are manifest in existing architectures. Today, AI systems exploiting large language models (LLMs) offer a relatively new combination of mechanisms and representations available for exploring the possibilities of general intelligence. This paper outlines a few recurring cognitive design patterns that have appeared in various pre-transformer AI architectures. We then explore how these patterns are evident in systems using LLMs, especially for reasoning and interactive ("agentic") use cases. Examining and applying these recurring patterns enables predictions of gaps or deficiencies in today's Agentic LLM Systems and identification of subjects of future research towards general intelligence using generative foundation models.

  Achieving human-level intelligence requires refining the transition from the fast, intuitive System 1 to the slower, more deliberate System 2 reasoning. While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \href{this https URL}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and drive progress in this rapidly evolving field.

  Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain underexplored. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED's effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications. Our code is available at:this https URL.
