  The rapid evolution of large language models in natural language processing has substantially elevated their semantic understanding and logical reasoning capabilities. Such proficiencies have been leveraged in autonomous driving systems, contributing to significant improvements in system performance. Models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, an advanced cognitive method that simulates human thinking processes, demonstrating remarkable reasoning capabilities in complex tasks. By structuring complex driving scenarios within a systematic reasoning framework, this approach has emerged as a prominent research focus in autonomous driving, substantially improving the system's ability to handle challenging cases. This paper investigates how CoT methods improve the reasoning abilities of autonomous driving models. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we present a systematic analysis of the motivations, methodologies, challenges, and future research directions of CoT in autonomous driving. Furthermore, we propose the insight of combining CoT with self-learning to facilitate self-evolution in driving systems. To ensure the relevance and timeliness of this study, we have compiled a dynamic repository of literature and open-source projects, diligently updated to incorporate forefront developments.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently advanced robotic manipulation by leveraging vision for scene perception and language for instruction following. However, existing methods rely heavily on costly human-annotated training datasets, which limits their generalization and causes them to struggle in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios, reducing real-world adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose ManipLVM-R1, a novel reinforcement learning framework that replaces traditional supervision with Reinforcement Learning using Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). By directly optimizing for task-aligned outcomes, our method enhances generalization and physical reasoning while removing the dependence on costly annotations. Specifically, we design two rule-based reward functions targeting key robotic manipulation subtasks: an Affordance Perception Reward to enhance localization of interaction regions, and a Trajectory Match Reward to ensure the physical plausibility of action paths. These rewards provide immediate feedback and impose spatial-logical constraints, encouraging the model to go beyond shallow pattern matching and instead learn deeper, more systematic reasoning about physical interactions.

- **[The One RING: a Robotic Indoor Navigation Generalist](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14401)**  `arXiv:2412.14401`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern robots vary significantly in shape, size, and sensor configurations used to perceive and interact with their environments. However, most navigation policies are embodiment-specific--a policy trained on one robot typically fails to generalize to another, even with minor changes in body size or camera viewpoint. As custom hardware becomes increasingly common, there is a growing need for a single policy that generalizes across embodiments, eliminating the need to retrain for each specific robot. In this paper, we introduce RING (Robotic Indoor Navigation Generalist), an embodiment-agnostic policy that turns any mobile robot into an effective indoor semantic navigator. Trained entirely in simulation, RING leverages large-scale randomization over robot embodiments to enable robust generalization to many real-world platforms. To support this, we augment the AI2-THOR simulator to instantiate robots with controllable configurations, varying in body size, rotation pivot point, and camera parameters. On the visual object-goal navigation task, RING achieves strong cross-embodiment (XE) generalization--72.1% average success rate across five simulated embodiments (a 16.7% absolute improvement on the Chores-S benchmark) and 78.9% across four real-world platforms, including Stretch RE-1, LoCoBot, and Unitree Go1--matching or even surpassing embodiment-specific policies. We further deploy RING on the RB-Y1 wheeled humanoid in a real-world kitchen environment, showcasing its out-of-the-box potential for mobile manipulation platforms. (Project website:this https URL)

- **[GRoQ-LoCO: Generalist and Robot-agnostic Quadruped Locomotion Control using Offline Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10973)**  `arXiv:2505.10973`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large-scale offline training have demonstrated the potential of generalist policy learning for complex robotic tasks. However, applying these principles to legged locomotion remains a challenge due to continuous dynamics and the need for real-time adaptation across diverse terrains and robot morphologies. In this work, we propose GRoQ-LoCO, a scalable, attention-based framework that learns a single generalist locomotion policy across multiple quadruped robots and terrains, relying solely on offline datasets. Our approach leverages expert demonstrations from two distinct locomotion behaviors - stair traversal (non-periodic gaits) and flat terrain traversal (periodic gaits) - collected across multiple quadruped robots, to train a generalist model that enables behavior fusion. Crucially, our framework operates solely on proprioceptive data from all robots without incorporating any robot-specific encodings. The policy is directly deployable on an Intel i7 nuc, producing low-latency control outputs without any test-time optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate zero-shot transfer across highly diverse quadruped robots and terrains, including hardware deployment on the Unitree Go1, a commercially available 12kg robot. Notably, we evaluate challenging cross-robot training setups where different locomotion skills are unevenly distributed across robots, yet observe successful transfer of both flat walking and stair traversal behaviors to all robots at test time. We also show preliminary walking on Stoch 5, a 70kg quadruped, on flat and outdoor terrains without requiring any fine tuning. These results demonstrate the potential of offline, data-driven learning to generalize locomotion across diverse quadruped morphologies and behaviors.

  While autonomous driving (AD) stacks struggle with decision making under partial observability and real-world complexity, human drivers are capable of commonsense reasoning to make near-optimal decisions with limited information. Recent work has attempted to leverage finetuned Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for trajectory planning at inference time to emulate human behavior. Despite their success in benchmark evaluations, these methods are often impractical to deploy (a 70B parameter VLM inference at merely 8 tokens per second requires more than 160G of memory), and their monolithic network structure prohibits safety decomposition. To bridge this gap, we propose VLM-Embedded Reasoning for autonomous Driving (VERDI), a training-time framework that distills the reasoning process and commonsense knowledge of VLMs into the AD stack. VERDI augments modular differentiable end-to-end (e2e) AD models by aligning intermediate module outputs at the perception, prediction, and planning stages with text features explaining the driving reasoning process produced by VLMs. By encouraging alignment in latent space, VERDI enables the modular AD stack to internalize structured reasoning, without incurring the inference-time costs of large VLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the NuScenes dataset and find that VERDI outperforms existing e2e methods that do not embed reasoning by 10% in $\ell_{2}$ distance, while maintaining high inference speed.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans learn how and when to apply forces in the world via a complex physiological and psychological learning process. Attempting to replicate this in vision-language models (VLMs) presents two challenges: VLMs can produce harmful behavior, which is particularly dangerous for VLM-controlled robots which interact with the world, but imposing behavioral safeguards can limit their functional and ethical extents. We conduct two case studies on safeguarding VLMs which generate forceful robotic motion, finding that safeguards reduce both harmful and helpful behavior involving contact-rich manipulation of human body parts. Then, we discuss the key implication of this result--that value alignment may impede desirable robot capabilities--for model evaluation and robot learning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We address the problem of agile and rapid locomotion, a key characteristic of quadrupedal and bipedal robots. We present a new algorithm that maintains stability and generates high-speed trajectories by considering the temporal aspect of locomotion. Our formulation takes into account past information based on a novel history-aware curriculum Learning (HACL) algorithm. We model the history of joint velocity commands with respect to the observed linear and angular rewards using a recurrent neural net (RNN). The hidden state helps the curriculum learn the relationship between the forward linear velocity and angular velocity commands and the rewards over a given time-step. We validate our approach on the MIT Mini Cheetah,Unitree Go1, and Go2 robots in a simulated environment and on a Unitree Go1 robot in real-world scenarios. In practice, HACL achieves peak forward velocity of 6.7 m/s for a given command velocity of 7m/s and outperforms prior locomotion algorithms by nearly 20%.

- **[McARL:Morphology-Control-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Quadrupedal Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18418)**  `arXiv:2505.18418`  `cs.RO`  
  _Prakhar Mishra, Amir Hossain Raj, Xuesu Xiao, Dinesh Manocha_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Morphology-Control-Aware Reinforcement Learning (McARL), a new approach to overcome challenges of hyperparameter tuning and transfer loss, enabling generalizable locomotion across robot morphologies. We use a morphology-conditioned policy by incorporating a randomized morphology vector, sampled from a defined morphology range, into both the actor and critic networks. This allows the policy to learn parameters that generalize to robots with similar characteristics. We demonstrate that a single policy trained on a Unitree Go1 robot using McARL can be transferred to a different morphology (e.g., Unitree Go2 robot) and can achieve zero-shot transfer velocity of up to 3.5 m/s without retraining or fine-tuning. Moreover, it achieves 6.0 m/s on the training Go1 robot and generalizes to other morphologies like A1 and Mini Cheetah. We also analyze the impact of morphology distance on transfer performance and highlight McARL's advantages over prior approaches. McARL achieves 44-150% higher transfer performance on Go2, Mini Cheetah, and A1 compared to PPO variants.

- **[One Demo Is All It Takes: Planning Domain Derivation with LLMs from A Single Demonstration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18382)**  `arXiv:2505.18382`  `cs.RO`  
  _Jinbang Huang, Yixin Xiao, Zhanguang Zhang, Mark Coates, Jianye Hao, Yingxue Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in solving planning problems but often struggle to ensure plan correctness, especially for long-horizon tasks. Meanwhile, traditional robotic task and motion planning (TAMP) frameworks address these challenges more reliably by combining high-level symbolic search with low-level motion planning. At the core of TAMP is the planning domain, an abstract world representation defined through symbolic predicates and actions. However, creating these domains typically involves substantial manual effort and domain expertise, limiting generalizability. We introduce Planning Domain Derivation with LLMs (PDDLLM), a novel approach that combines simulated physical interaction with LLM reasoning to improve planning performance. The method reduces reliance on humans by inferring planning domains from a single annotated task-execution demonstration. Unlike prior domain-inference methods that rely on partially predefined or language descriptions of planning domains, PDDLLM constructs domains entirely from scratch and automatically integrates them with low-level motion planning skills, enabling fully automated long-horizon planning. PDDLLM is evaluated on over 1,200 diverse tasks spanning nine environments and benchmarked against six LLM-based planning baselines, demonstrating superior long-horizon planning performance, lower token costs, and successful deployment on multiple physical robot platforms.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Legged robots have become capable of performing highly dynamic maneuvers in the past few years. However, agile locomotion in highly constrained environments such as stepping stones is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a combination of model-based control, search, and learning to design efficient control policies for agile locomotion on stepping stones. In our framework, we use nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to generate whole-body motions for a given contact plan. To efficiently search for an optimal contact plan, we propose to use Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). While the combination of MCTS and NMPC can quickly find a feasible plan for a given environment (a few seconds), it is not yet suitable to be used as a reactive policy. Hence, we generate a dataset for optimal goal-conditioned policy for a given scene and learn it through supervised learning. In particular, we leverage the power of diffusion models in handling multi-modality in the dataset. We test our proposed framework on a scenario where our quadruped robot Solo12 successfully jumps to different goals in a highly constrained environment.

- **[Which Agent Causes Task Failures and When? On Automated Failure Attribution of LLM Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00212)**  `arXiv:2505.00212`  `cs.MA` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Failure attribution in LLM multi-agent systems-identifying the agent and step responsible for task failures-provides crucial clues for systems debugging but remains underexplored and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose and formulate a new research area: automated failure attribution for LLM multi-agent systems. To support this initiative, we introduce the Who&When dataset, comprising extensive failure logs from 127 LLM multi-agent systems with fine-grained annotations linking failures to specific agents and decisive error steps. Using the Who&When, we develop and evaluate three automated failure attribution methods, summarizing their corresponding pros and cons. The best method achieves 53.5% accuracy in identifying failure-responsible agents but only 14.2% in pinpointing failure steps, with some methods performing below random. Even SOTA reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, fail to achieve practical usability. These results highlight the task's complexity and the need for further research in this area.

  Multi-agent systems (MAS) decompose complex tasks and delegate subtasks to different large language model (LLM) agents and tools. Prior studies have reported the superior accuracy performance of MAS across diverse domains, enabled by long-horizon context tracking and error correction through role-specific agents. However, the design and deployment of MAS incur higher complexity and runtime cost compared to single-agent systems (SAS). Meanwhile, frontier LLMs, such as OpenAI-o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, have rapidly advanced in long-context reasoning, memory retention, and tool usage, mitigating many limitations that originally motivated MAS designs. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study comparing MAS and SAS across various popular agentic applications. We find that the benefits of MAS over SAS diminish as LLM capabilities improve, and we propose efficient mechanisms to pinpoint the error-prone agent in MAS. Furthermore, the performance discrepancy between MAS and SAS motivates our design of a hybrid agentic paradigm, request cascading between MAS and SAS, to improve both efficiency and capability. Our design improves accuracy by 1.1-12% while reducing deployment costs by up to 20% across various agentic applications.

- **[An Explainable Diagnostic Framework for Neurodegenerative Dementias via Reinforcement-Optimized LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19954)**  `arXiv:2505.19954`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Andrew Zamai, Nathanael Fijalkow, Boris Mansencal, Laurent Simon, Eloi Navet, Pierrick Coupe_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias is a challenging clinical task, mainly because of the overlap in symptom presentation and the similarity of patterns observed in structural neuroimaging. To improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, deep learning-based methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers have been proposed for the automatic classification of brain MRIs. However, despite their strong predictive performance, these models find limited clinical utility due to their opaque decision making. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates two core components to enhance diagnostic transparency. First, we introduce a modular pipeline for converting 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs into textual radiology reports. Second, we explore the potential of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist clinicians in the differential diagnosis between Frontotemporal dementia subtypes, Alzheimer's disease, and normal aging based on the generated reports. To bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and explainability, we employ reinforcement learning to incentivize diagnostic reasoning in LLMs. Without requiring supervised reasoning traces or distillation from larger models, our approach enables the emergence of structured diagnostic rationales grounded in neuroimaging findings. Unlike post-hoc explainability methods that retrospectively justify model decisions, our framework generates diagnostic rationales as part of the inference process-producing causally grounded explanations that inform and guide the model's decision-making process. In doing so, our framework matches the diagnostic performance of existing deep learning methods while offering rationales that support its diagnostic conclusions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training large language models (LLMs) for complex reasoning via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is effective but limited by reliance on costly, domain-specific supervision. We explore Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), a framework that enables LLMs to learn from intrinsic signals without external rewards or labeled data. We propose Intuitor, an RLIF method that uses a model's own confidence, termed self-certainty, as its sole reward signal. Intuitor replaces external rewards in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-certainty scores, enabling fully unsupervised learning. Experiments demonstrate that Intuitor matches GRPO's performance on mathematical benchmarks while achieving superior generalization to out-of-domain tasks like code generation, without requiring gold solutions or test cases. Our findings show that intrinsic model signals can drive effective learning across domains, offering a scalable alternative to RLVR for autonomous AI systems where verifiable rewards are unavailable.

- **[On the Effect of Negative Gradient in Group Relative Deep Reinforcement Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18830)**  `arXiv:2505.18830`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become popular in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) emerging as a widely used algorithm in recent systems. Despite GRPO's widespread adoption, we identify a previously unrecognized phenomenon we term Lazy Likelihood Displacement (LLD), wherein the likelihood of correct responses marginally increases or even decreases during training. This behavior mirrors a recently discovered misalignment issue in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), attributed to the influence of negative gradients. We provide a theoretical analysis of GRPO's learning dynamic, identifying the source of LLD as the naive penalization of all tokens in incorrect responses with the same strength. To address this, we develop a method called NTHR, which downweights penalties on tokens contributing to the LLD. Unlike prior DPO-based approaches, NTHR takes advantage of GRPO's group-based structure, using correct responses as anchors to identify influential tokens. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that NTHR effectively mitigates LLD, yielding consistent performance gains across models ranging from 0.5B to 3B parameters.

  Reasoning large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks, which has drawn significant attention to reinforcement learning (RL) for LLMs. However, existing approaches allocate an equal number of rollouts to all questions during the RL process, which is inefficient. This inefficiency stems from the fact that training on simple questions yields limited gains, whereas more rollouts are needed for challenging questions to sample correct answers. Furthermore, while RL improves response precision, it limits the model's exploration ability, potentially resulting in a performance cap below that of the base model prior to RL. To address these issues, we propose a mechanism for dynamically allocating rollout budgets based on the difficulty of the problems, enabling more efficient RL training. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive dynamic temperature adjustment strategy to maintain the entropy at a stable level, thereby encouraging sufficient exploration. This enables LLMs to improve response precision while preserving their exploratory ability to uncover potential correct pathways. The code and data is available on:this https URL

  Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled autonomous agents to interact with computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), where accurately localizing the coordinates of interface elements (e.g., buttons) is often required for fine-grained actions. However, this remains significantly challenging, leading prior works to rely on large-scale web datasets to improve the grounding accuracy. In this work, we propose Reasoning Graphical User Interface Grounding for Data Efficiency (ReGUIDE), a novel and effective framework for web grounding that enables MLLMs to learn data efficiently through self-generated reasoning and spatial-aware criticism. More specifically, ReGUIDE learns to (i) self-generate a language reasoning process for the localization via online reinforcement learning, and (ii) criticize the prediction using spatial priors that enforce equivariance under input transformations. At inference time, ReGUIDE further boosts performance through a test-time scaling strategy, which combines spatial search with coordinate aggregation. Our experiments demonstrate that ReGUIDE significantly advances web grounding performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming baselines with substantially fewer training data points (e.g., only 0.2% samples compared to the best open-sourced baselines).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks, yet they often exhibit difficulty in distinguishing task-relevant from irrelevant signals, particularly in tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA), which can lead to susceptibility to misleading or spurious inputs. We refer to this broader limitation as the Cross-Modality Competency Problem: the model's inability to fairly evaluate all modalities. This vulnerability becomes more evident in modality-specific tasks such as image classification or pure text question answering, where models are expected to rely solely on one modality. In such tasks, spurious information from irrelevant modalities often leads to significant performance degradation. We refer to this failure as Modality Interference, which serves as a concrete and measurable instance of the cross-modality competency problem. We further design a perturbation-based causal diagnostic experiment to verify and quantify this problem. To mitigate modality interference, we propose a novel framework to fine-tune MLLMs, including perturbation-based data augmentations with both heuristic perturbations and adversarial perturbations via Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and a consistency regularization strategy applied to model outputs with original and perturbed inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets (image-heavy, text-heavy, and VQA tasks) and multiple model families with different scales demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and cross-modality competency, indicating our method's effectiveness in boosting unimodal reasoning ability while enhancing performance on multimodal tasks.

  Modern foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) and large multi-modal models (LMMs) require a massive amount of computational and memory resources. We propose a new framework to convert such LLMs/LMMs into a reduced-dimension latent structure. Our method extends a local activation-aware tensor decomposition to a global attention-aware joint tensor de-composition. Our framework can significantly improve the model accuracy over the existing model compression methods when reducing the latent dimension to realize computationally/memory-efficient LLMs/LLMs. We show the benefit on several benchmark including multi-modal reasoning tasks.

  Effective generalization in language models depends critically on the diversity of their training data. Yet existing diversity metrics often fall short of this goal, relying on surface-level heuristics that are decoupled from model behavior. This motivates us to ask: What kind of diversity in training data actually drives generalization in language models -- and how can we measure and amplify it? Through large-scale empirical analyses spanning over 300 training runs, carefully controlled for data scale and quality, we show that data diversity can be a strong predictor of generalization in LLM reasoning -- as measured by average model performance on unseen out-of-distribution benchmarks. We introduce G-Vendi, a metric that quantifies diversity via the entropy of model-induced gradients. Despite using a small off-the-shelf proxy model for gradients, G-Vendi consistently outperforms alternative measures, achieving strong correlation (Spearman's $\rho \approx 0.9$) with out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on both natural language inference (NLI) and math reasoning tasks. Building on this insight, we present Prismatic Synthesis, a framework for generating diverse synthetic data by targeting underrepresented regions in gradient space. Experimental results show that Prismatic Synthesis consistently improves model performance as we scale synthetic data -- not just on in-distribution test but across unseen, out-of-distribution benchmarks -- significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models that rely on 20 times larger data generator than ours. For example, PrismMath-7B, our model distilled from a 32B LLM, outperforms R1-Distill-Qwen-7B -- the same base model trained on proprietary data generated by 671B R1 -- on 6 out of 7 challenging benchmarks.

  We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward using one training example (1-shot RLVR) is effective in incentivizing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Applying RLVR to the base model Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, we identify a single example that elevates model performance on MATH500 from 36.0% to 73.6%, and improves the average performance across six common mathematical reasoning benchmarks from 17.6% to 35.7%. This result matches the performance obtained using the 1.2k DeepScaleR subset (MATH500: 73.6%, average: 35.9%), which includes the aforementioned example. Furthermore, RLVR with only two examples even slightly exceeds these results (MATH500: 74.8%, average: 36.6%). Similar substantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and PPO), and different math examples (when employed as a single training example). In addition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including cross-domain generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and sustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has saturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we verify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy gradient loss, distinguishing it from the "grokking" phenomenon. We also show the critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by incorporating entropy loss with an appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training.

  Training large language models (LLMs) as interactive agents presents unique challenges including long-horizon decision making and interacting with stochastic environment feedback. While reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled progress in static tasks, multi-turn agent RL training remains underexplored. We propose StarPO (State-Thinking-Actions-Reward Policy Optimization), a general framework for trajectory-level agent RL, and introduce RAGEN, a modular system for training and evaluating LLM agents. Our study on four stylized environments reveals three core findings. First, our agent RL training shows a recurring mode of Echo Trap where reward variance cliffs and gradient spikes; we address this with StarPO-S, a stabilized variant with trajectory filtering, critic incorporation, and gradient stabilization. Second, we find the shaping of RL rollouts would benefit from diverse initial states, medium interaction granularity and more frequent sampling. Third, we show that without fine-grained, reasoning-aware reward signals, agent reasoning hardly emerge through multi-turn RL and they may show shallow strategies or hallucinated thoughts.

  Reasoning has substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complicated tasks. Central to the current reasoning studies, Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a fine-grained evaluation of intermediate reasoning steps and guide the reasoning process. However, extending PRMs to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces challenges. Since multimodal reasoning covers a wider range of tasks compared to text-only scenarios, the resulting distribution shift from the training to testing sets is more severe, leading to greater generalization difficulty. Training a reliable multimodal PRM, therefore, demands large and diverse datasets to ensure sufficient coverage. However, current multimodal reasoning datasets suffer from a marked quality imbalance, which degrades PRM performance and highlights the need for an effective data selection strategy. To address the issues, we introduce DreamPRM, a domain-reweighted training framework for multimodal PRMs which employs bi-level optimization. In the lower-level optimization, DreamPRM performs fine-tuning on multiple datasets with domain weights, allowing the PRM to prioritize high-quality reasoning signals and alleviating the impact of dataset quality imbalance. In the upper-level optimization, the PRM is evaluated on a separate meta-learning dataset; this feedback updates the domain weights through an aggregation loss function, thereby improving the generalization capability of trained PRM. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks covering both mathematical and general reasoning show that test-time scaling with DreamPRM consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Further comparisons reveal that DreamPRM's domain-reweighting strategy surpasses other data selection methods and yields higher accuracy gains than existing test-time scaling approaches.

  Agricultural decision-making involves complex, context-specific reasoning, where choices about crops, practices, and interventions depend heavily on geographic, climatic, and economic conditions. Traditional large language models (LLMs) often fall short in navigating this nuanced problem due to limited reasoning capacity. We hypothesize that recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) can better handle such structured, domain-specific inference. To investigate this, we introduce AgReason, the first expert-curated open-ended science benchmark with 100 questions for agricultural reasoning. Evaluations across thirteen open-source and proprietary models reveal that LRMs outperform conventional ones, though notable challenges persist, with the strongest Gemini-based baseline achieving 36% accuracy. We also present AgThoughts, a large-scale dataset of 44.6K question-answer pairs generated with human oversight and equipped with synthetically generated reasoning traces. Using AgThoughts, we develop AgThinker, a suite of small reasoning models that can be run on consumer-grade GPUs, and show that our dataset can be effective in unlocking agricultural reasoning abilities in LLMs. Our project page is here:this https URL

  Reinforcement Learning Finetuning (RFT) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling long chains of thought, self-correction, and effective tool use. While recent works attempt to extend RFT to vision-language models (VLMs), these efforts largely produce text-only reasoning conditioned on static image inputs, falling short of true multimodal reasoning in the response. In contrast, test-time methods like Visual Sketchpad incorporate visual steps but lack training mechanisms.We introduce VTool-R1, the first framework that trains VLMs to generate multimodal chains of thought by interleaving text and intermediate visual reasoning steps. VTool-R1 integrates Python-based visual editing tools into the RFT process, enabling VLMs to learn when and how to generate visual reasoning steps that benefit final reasoning. Trained with outcome-based rewards tied to task accuracy, our approach elicits strategic visual tool use for reasoning without relying on process-based supervision. Experiments on structured visual question answering over charts and tables show that VTool-R1 enhances reasoning performance by teaching VLMs to "think with images" and generate multimodal chain of thoughts with tools.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent success of using human preferences to align large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved their performance in various downstream tasks like question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. However,3 achieving effective LLM alignment depends on high-quality human preference datasets. Collecting these datasets requires human preference annotation, which is costly and resource-intensive, necessitating efficient active data selection methods. Existing methods either lack a strong theoretical foundation or depend on restrictive reward function assumptions (e.g., linearity). To this end, we propose an algorithm, ActiveDPO, that uses a theoretically grounded data selection criterion for non-linear reward functions while directly leveraging the LLM itself to parameterize the reward model that is used for active data selection. As a result, ActiveDPO explicitly accounts for the influence of LLM on data selection, unlike methods that select the data without considering the LLM that is being aligned, thereby leading to more effective and efficient data collection. Extensive experiments show that ActiveDPO outperforms existing methods across various models and datasets.

  Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has emerged as a powerful post-training technique to incentivize the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs can respond very inconsistently to RFT: some show substantial performance gains, while others plateau or even degrade. To understand this divergence, we analyze the per-step influence of the RL objective and identify two key conditions for effective post-training: (1) RL-informative rollout accuracy, and (2) strong data co-influence, which quantifies how much the training data affects performance on other samples. Guided by these insights, we propose behavior injection, a task-agnostic data-augmentation scheme applied prior to RL. Behavior injection enriches the supervised finetuning (SFT) data by seeding exploratory and exploitative behaviors, effectively making the model more RL-ready. We evaluate our method across two reasoning benchmarks with multiple base models. The results demonstrate that our theoretically motivated augmentation can significantly increases the performance gain from RFT over the pre-RL model.

  Recent work on reasoning-oriented language models, exemplified by o1-like systems, suggests that reinforcement-learning (RL) finetuning does not create new capabilities but instead strengthens reasoning patterns already latent in the pretrained network. We test this claim by training steering vectors: layer-wise biases that additively amplify selected hidden features while leaving all original weights unchanged. Experiments on four base models across the GSM8K and MATH benchmarks show that steering vectors recover, and in several cases exceed, the accuracy of fully-tuned counterparts. This result supports the view that the required reasoning skills pre-exist in the base model. Further, logit-lens analysis reveals that the trained vectors consistently boost token groups linked to structured languages and logical connectors, providing an interpretable account that aligns with the demands of quantitative reasoning tasks.

  Graphs are a widely used paradigm for representing non-Euclidean data, with applications ranging from social network analysis to biomolecular prediction. Conventional graph learning approaches typically rely on fixed structural assumptions or fully observed data, limiting their effectiveness in more complex, noisy, or evolving settings. Consequently, real-world graph data often violates the assumptions of traditional graph learning methods, in particular, it leads to four fundamental challenges: (1) Incompleteness, real-world graphs have missing nodes, edges, or attributes; (2) Imbalance, the distribution of the labels of nodes or edges and their structures for real-world graphs are highly skewed; (3) Cross-domain Heterogeneity, graphs from different domains exhibit incompatible feature spaces or structural patterns; and (4) Dynamic Instability, graphs evolve over time in unpredictable ways. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to tackle these challenges by leveraging rich semantic reasoning and external knowledge. This survey provides a comprehensive review of how LLMs can be integrated with graph learning to address the aforementioned challenges. For each challenge, we review both traditional solutions and modern LLM-driven approaches, highlighting how LLMs contribute unique advantages. Finally, we discuss open research questions and promising future directions in this emerging interdisciplinary field.

  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has boosted math and coding in large language models, yet there has been little effort to extend RLVR into messier, real-world domains like forecasting. One sticking point is that outcome-based reinforcement learning for forecasting must learn from binary, delayed, and noisy rewards, a regime where standard fine-tuning is brittle. We show that outcome-only online RL on a 14B model can match frontier-scale accuracy and surpass it in calibration and hypothetical prediction market betting by adapting two leading algorithms, Group-Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) and ReMax, to the forecasting setting. Our adaptations remove per-question variance scaling in GRPO, apply baseline-subtracted advantages in ReMax, hydrate training with 100k temporally consistent synthetic questions, and introduce lightweight guard-rails that penalise gibberish, non-English responses and missing rationales, enabling a single stable pass over 110k events. Scaling ReMax to 110k questions and ensembling seven predictions yields a 14B model that matches frontier baseline o1 on accuracy on our holdout set (Brier = 0.193, p = 0.23) while beating it in calibration (ECE = 0.042, p < 0.001). A simple trading rule turns this calibration edge into \$127 of hypothetical profit versus \$92 for o1 (p = 0.037). This demonstrates that refined RLVR methods can convert small-scale LLMs into potentially economically valuable forecasting tools, with implications for scaling this to larger models.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but often face challenges with tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances reasoning, it indiscriminately generates lengthy reasoning steps for all queries, leading to substantial computational costs and inefficiency, especially for simpler inputs. To address this critical issue, we introduce AdaCoT (Adaptive Chain-of-Thought), a novel framework enabling LLMs to adaptively decide when to invoke CoT. AdaCoT framed adaptive reasoning as a Pareto optimization problem that seeks to balance model performance with the costs associated with CoT invocation (both frequency and computational overhead). We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based method, specifically utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to dynamically control the CoT triggering decision boundary by adjusting penalty coefficients, thereby allowing the model to determine CoT necessity based on implicit query complexity. A key technical contribution is Selective Loss Masking (SLM), designed to counteract decision boundary collapse during multi-stage RL training, ensuring robust and stable adaptive triggering. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaCoT successfully navigates the Pareto frontier, achieving substantial reductions in CoT usage for queries not requiring elaborate reasoning. For instance, on our production traffic testset, AdaCoT reduced CoT triggering rates to as low as 3.18\% and decreased average response tokens by 69.06%, while maintaining high performance on complex tasks.

  Large language models (LLMs) continue to face challenges in reliably solving reasoning tasks, particularly those that require precise rule following, as often found in mathematical reasoning. This paper introduces a novel neurosymbolic method that improves LLM reasoning by encoding hidden states into neurosymbolic vectors, enabling problem-solving within a neurosymbolic vector space. The results are decoded and merged with the original hidden state, significantly boosting the model's performance on numerical reasoning tasks. By offloading computation through neurosymbolic representations, this method enhances efficiency, reliability, and interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate an average of 88.6% lower cross-entropy loss and 15.4 times more problems correctly solved on a suite of mathematical reasoning tasks compared to chain-of-thought prompting and supervised fine-tuning (LoRA), without degrading performance on other tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While direct policy optimization methods exist, pioneering LLMs are fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to generate better responses under the supervision of a reward model learned from preference data. One major challenge of RLHF is the inaccuracy of the intermediate reward model, especially in the tasks that requires complex reasoning for the reward model to score a response. We find that the reliability of the reward model varies across responses assigned with different rewards. This motivates us to filter the samples whose rewards may be unreliable to improve the signal-to-noise ratio during policy learning, resulting in Policy Filtration for Proximal Policy Optimization (PF-PPO). To choose a proper policy filtering strategy, we use the coefficient of determination (R2) between the rewards and actual scores on filtered samples as the metrics to help us find promising strategies since it measures how well the rewards filtered by PF-PPO indicate real performance. We provide extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of PF-PPO in code generation and math reasoning tasks. In code generation, PF-PPO achieves the state-of-the-art performance of 7-billion-parameter models on HumanEval (+7.9%), MBPP (+0.7%), and LeetCode Contest (+10.0%) which is a more challenging benchmark created by us. In math reasoning, PF-PPO yields performance increase using different reward models and benchmarks (Ape210K and CMATH). Code is available onthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities in math and coding, often bolstered by post-training on the chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) generated by stronger models. However, existing strategies for curating such training data predominantly rely on heuristics, limiting generalizability and failing to capture subtleties underlying in data. To address these limitations, we leverage influence functions to systematically attribute LLMs' reasoning ability on math and coding to individual training examples, sequences, and tokens, enabling deeper insights into effective data characteristics. Our Influence-based Reasoning Attribution (Infra) uncovers nontrivial cross-domain effects across math and coding tasks: high-difficulty math examples improve both math and code reasoning, while low-difficulty code tasks most effectively benefit code reasoning. Based on these findings, we introduce a simple yet effective dataset reweighting strategy by flipping task difficulty, which doubles AIME24 accuracy from 10\% to 20\% and boosts LiveCodeBench accuracy from 33.8\% to 35.3\% for Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Moreover, our fine-grained attribution reveals that the sequence-level exploratory behaviors enhance reasoning performance in both math and code, and the token-level influence patterns are distinct for math and code reasoning: the former prefers natural language logic connectors and the latter emphasizes structural syntax.

  Zero-shot streaming text-to-speech is an important research topic in human-computer interaction. Existing methods primarily use a lookahead mechanism, relying on future text to achieve natural streaming speech synthesis, which introduces high processing latency. To address this issue, we propose SMLLE, a streaming framework for generating high-quality speech frame-by-frame. SMLLE employs a Transducer to convert text into semantic tokens in real time while simultaneously obtaining duration alignment information. The combined outputs are then fed into a fully autoregressive (AR) streaming model to reconstruct mel-spectrograms. To further stabilize the generation process, we design a Delete < Bos > Mechanism that allows the AR model to access future text introducing as minimal delay as possible. Experimental results suggest that the SMLLE outperforms current streaming TTS methods and achieves comparable performance over sentence-level TTS systems. Samples are available onthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in ex-ante reasoning, where analysis, inference, or predictions must be made without access to information from future events. Even with explicit prompts enforcing temporal cutoffs, LLMs often generate outputs influenced by internalized knowledge of events beyond the specified cutoff. This paper introduces a novel task and benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to reason while adhering to such temporal constraints. The benchmark includes a variety of tasks: stock prediction, Wikipedia event prediction, scientific publication prediction, and Question Answering (QA), designed to assess factual knowledge under temporal cutoff constraints. We use leakage rate to quantify models' reliance on future information beyond cutoff timestamps. Experimental results reveal that LLMs struggle to consistently adhere to temporal cutoffs across common prompting strategies and tasks, demonstrating persistent challenges in ex-ante reasoning. This benchmark provides a potential evaluation framework to advance the development of LLMs' temporal reasoning ability for time-sensitive applications.

  Post-training compression reduces the computational and memory costs of large language models (LLMs), enabling resource-efficient deployment. However, existing compression benchmarks only focus on language modeling (e.g., perplexity) and natural language understanding tasks (e.g., GLUE accuracy), ignoring the agentic capabilities - workflow, tool use/function call, long-context understanding and real-world application. We introduce the Agent Compression Benchmark (ACBench), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how compression impacts LLMs' agentic abilities. ACBench spans (1) 12 tasks across 4 capabilities (e.g., WorfBench for workflow generation, Needle-in-Haystack for long-context retrieval), (2) quantization (GPTQ, AWQ) and pruning (Wanda, SparseGPT), and (3) 15 models, including small (Gemma-2B), standard (Qwen2.5 7B-32B), and distilled reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1-Distill). Our experiments reveal compression tradeoffs: 4-bit quantization preserves workflow generation and tool use (1%-3% drop) but degrades real-world application accuracy by 10%-15%. We introduce ERank, Top-k Ranking Correlation and Energy to systematize analysis. ACBench provides actionable insights for optimizing LLM compression in agentic scenarios.

  Ensuring the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks remains a formidable challenge, particularly in scenarios that demand precise mathematical calculations and knowledge-intensive open-domain generation. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware framework designed to enhance the accuracy of LLM responses by systematically incorporating model confidence at critical decision points. We propose an approach that encourages multi-step reasoning in LLMs and quantify the confidence of intermediate answers such as numerical results in mathematical reasoning and proper nouns in open-domain generation. Then, the overall confidence of each reasoning chain is evaluated based on confidence of these critical intermediate steps. Finally, we aggregate the answer of generated response paths in a way that reflects the reliability of each generated content (as opposed to self-consistency in which each generated chain contributes equally to majority voting). We conducted extensive experiments in five datasets, three mathematical datasets and two open-domain datasets, using four LLMs. The results consistently validate the effectiveness of our novel confidence aggregation method, leading to an accuracy improvement of up to 7.4% and 5.8% over baseline approaches in math and open-domain generation tasks, respectively.

  Schr√∂dinger bridge (SB) has emerged as the go-to method for optimizing transportation plans in diffusion models. However, SB requires estimating the intractable forward score functions, inevitably resulting in the costly implicit training loss based on simulated trajectories. To improve the scalability while preserving efficient transportation plans, we leverage variational inference to linearize the forward score functions (variational scores) of SB and restore simulation-free properties in training backward scores. We propose the variational Schr√∂dinger diffusion model (VSDM), where the forward process is a multivariate diffusion and the variational scores are adaptively optimized for efficient transport. Theoretically, we use stochastic approximation to prove the convergence of the variational scores and show the convergence of the adaptively generated samples based on the optimal variational scores. Empirically, we test the algorithm in simulated examples and observe that VSDM is efficient in generations of anisotropic shapes and yields straighter sample trajectories compared to the single-variate diffusion. We also verify the scalability of the algorithm in real-world data and achieve competitive unconditional generation performance in CIFAR10 and conditional generation in time series modeling. Notably, VSDM no longer depends on warm-up initializations and has become tuning-friendly in training large-scale experiments.

  Large multimodal foundation models, particularly in the domains of language and vision, have significantly advanced various tasks, including robotics, autonomous driving, information retrieval, and grounding. However, many of these models perceive objects as indivisible, overlooking the components that constitute them. Understanding these components and their associated affordances provides valuable insights into an object's functionality, which is fundamental for performing a wide range of tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel real-world benchmark, InstructPart, comprising hand-labeled part segmentation annotations and task-oriented instructions to evaluate the performance of current models in understanding and executing part-level tasks within everyday contexts. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that task-oriented part segmentation remains a challenging problem, even for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In addition to our benchmark, we introduce a simple baseline that achieves a twofold performance improvement through fine-tuning with our dataset. With our dataset and benchmark, we aim to facilitate research on task-oriented part segmentation and enhance the applicability of VLMs across various domains, including robotics, virtual reality, information retrieval, and other related fields.

  The rapid advancement of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for 2D images and videos has motivated extending these models to understand 3D scenes, aiming for human-like visual-spatial intelligence. Nevertheless, achieving deep spatial understanding comparable to human capabilities poses significant challenges in model encoding and data acquisition. Existing methods frequently depend on external depth sensors for geometry capture or utilize off-the-shelf algorithms for pre-constructing 3D maps, thereby limiting their scalability, especially with prevalent monocular video inputs and for time-sensitive applications. In this work, we introduce VLM-3R, a unified framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that incorporates 3D Reconstructive instruction tuning. VLM-3R processes monocular video frames by employing a geometry encoder to derive implicit 3D tokens that represent spatial understanding. Leveraging our Spatial-Visual-View Fusion and over 200K curated 3D reconstructive instruction tuning question-answer (QA) pairs, VLM-3R effectively aligns real-world spatial context with language instructions. This enables monocular 3D spatial assistance and embodied reasoning. To facilitate the evaluation of temporal reasoning, we introduce the Vision-Spatial-Temporal Intelligence benchmark, featuring over 138.6K QA pairs across five distinct tasks focused on evolving spatial relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model, VLM-3R, not only facilitates robust visual-spatial reasoning but also enables the understanding of temporal 3D context changes, excelling in both accuracy and scalability.

  Infographic charts are a powerful medium for communicating abstract data by combining visual elements (e.g., charts, images) with textual information. However, their visual and structural richness poses challenges for large vision-language models (LVLMs), which are typically trained on plain charts. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChartGalaxy, a million-scale dataset designed to advance the understanding and generation of infographic charts. The dataset is constructed through an inductive process that identifies 75 chart types, 330 chart variations, and 68 layout templates from real infographic charts and uses them to create synthetic ones programmatically. We showcase the utility of this dataset through: 1) improving infographic chart understanding via fine-tuning, 2) benchmarking code generation for infographic charts, and 3) enabling example-based infographic chart generation. By capturing the visual and structural complexity of real design, ChartGalaxy provides a useful resource for enhancing multimodal reasoning and generation in LVLMs.

  Due to the powerful vision-language reasoning and generalization abilities, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention in the field of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, their application to closed-loop systems remains underexplored, and current MLLM-based methods have not shown clear superiority to mainstream E2E imitation learning approaches. In this work, we propose ReasonPlan, a novel MLLM fine-tuning framework designed for closed-loop driving through holistic reasoning with a self-supervised Next Scene Prediction task and supervised Decision Chain-of-Thought process. This dual mechanism encourages the model to align visual representations with actionable driving context, while promoting interpretable and causally grounded decision making. We curate a planning-oriented decision reasoning dataset, namely PDR, comprising 210k diverse and high-quality samples. Our method outperforms the mainstream E2E imitation learning method by a large margin of 19% L2 and 16.1 driving score on Bench2Drive benchmark. Furthermore, ReasonPlan demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on unseen DOS benchmark, highlighting its adaptability in handling zero-shot corner cases.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in visual tasks, including semantic scene understanding and text-image alignment, with reasoning variants enhancing performance on complex tasks involving mathematics and logic. However, their capacity for reasoning tasks involving fine-grained visual understanding remains insufficiently evaluated. To address this gap, we introduce ReasonMap, a benchmark designed to assess the fine-grained visual understanding and spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ReasonMap encompasses high-resolution transit maps from 30 cities across 13 countries and includes 1,008 question-answer pairs spanning two question types and three templates. Furthermore, we design a two-level evaluation pipeline that properly assesses answer correctness and quality. Comprehensive evaluations of 15 popular MLLMs, including both base and reasoning variants, reveal a counterintuitive pattern: among open-source models, base models outperform reasoning ones, while the opposite trend is observed in closed-source models. Additionally, performance generally degrades when visual inputs are masked, indicating that while MLLMs can leverage prior knowledge to answer some questions, fine-grained visual reasoning tasks still require genuine visual perception for strong performance. Our benchmark study offers new insights into visual reasoning and contributes to investigating the gap between open-source and closed-source models.

  Chain-of-thought reasoning has significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. However, this reasoning process has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its effectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel framework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual reasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable VLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby enhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks. Our 7B model, \model, achieves 84\% on V* bench, 74\% on TallyQA-Complex, and 84\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy achieved by any open-source model to date. These results highlight the importance of pixel-space reasoning and the effectiveness of our framework.

  Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), the task of locating specific video segments based on language queries, is a core challenge in long-form video understanding. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown early promise in tackling TVG through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), their abilities to generalize remain limited. To address this, we propose a novel post-training framework that enhances the generalization capabilities of LVLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our contributions span three key directions: (1) Time-R1: we introduce a reasoning-guided post-training framework via RL with verifiable reward to enhance the capabilities of LVLMs on the TVG task. (2) TimeRFT: we explore data-efficient post-training strategies on our curated RL-friendly dataset, which trains the model to progressively comprehend difficult samples, leading to better generalization. (3) TVGBench: we carefully construct a small yet comprehensive benchmark for LVLM evaluation, assessing 11 types of queries and featuring balanced distributions across both videos and queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream datasets using only 2.5K training data, while improving its general video understanding capabilities.

  Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal comprehension and reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with trivially simple visual tasks. In this work, we focus on the domain of basic 2D Euclidean geometry and systematically categorize the fundamental, indivisible visual perception skills, which we refer to as atomic visual skills. We then introduce the Atomic Visual Skills Dataset (AVSD) for evaluating VLMs on the atomic visual skills. Using AVSD, we benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs and find that they struggle with these tasks, despite being trivial for adult humans. Our findings highlight the need for purpose-built datasets to train and evaluate VLMs on atomic, rather than composite, visual perception tasks.

  DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated powerful reasoning capabilities in the text domain through stable reinforcement learning (RL). Recently, in the multimodal domain, works have begun to directly apply RL to generate R1-like free-form reasoning for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. However, multimodal tasks share an intrinsically different nature from textual tasks, which heavily rely on the understanding of the input image to solve the problem. Therefore, such free-form reasoning faces two critical limitations in the VQA task: (1) Extended reasoning chains diffuse visual focus away from task-critical regions, degrading answer accuracy. (2) Unverifiable intermediate steps amplify policy-gradient variance and computational costs overhead. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce SATORI ($\textbf{S}patially$ $\textbf{A}nchored$ $\textbf{T}ask$ $\textbf{O}ptimization$ with $\textbf{R}e\textbf{I}nforcement$ Learning), which decomposes VQA into three verifiable stages, including global image captioning, region localization, and answer prediction, each supplying explicit reward signals. Furthermore, we also introduce VQA-Verify, a 12k dataset annotated with answer-aligned captions and bounding-boxes to facilitate training. Experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements across seven VQA benchmarks, achieving up to $15.7\%$ improvement in accuracy in accuracy compared to the R1-like baseline. Our analysis of the attention map confirms enhanced focus on critical regions, which brings improvements in accuracy. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Medical large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance across various single-image question answering (QA) benchmarks, yet their capability in processing multi-image clinical scenarios remains underexplored. Unlike single image based tasks, medical tasks involving multiple images often demand sophisticated visual understanding capabilities, such as temporal reasoning and cross-modal analysis, which are poorly supported by current medical LVLMs. To bridge this critical gap, we present the Med-MIM instruction dataset, comprising 83.2K medical multi-image QA pairs that span four types of multi-image visual abilities (temporal understanding, reasoning, comparison, co-reference). Using this dataset, we fine-tune Mantis and LLaVA-Med, resulting in two specialized medical VLMs: MIM-LLaVA-Med and Med-Mantis, both optimized for multi-image analysis. Additionally, we develop the Med-MIM benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the medical multi-image understanding capabilities of LVLMs. We assess eight popular LVLMs, including our two models, on the Med-MIM benchmark. Experimental results show that both Med-Mantis and MIM-LLaVA-Med achieve superior performance on the held-in and held-out subsets of the Med-MIM benchmark, demonstrating that the Med-MIM instruction dataset effectively enhances LVLMs' multi-image understanding capabilities in the medical domain.

  Understanding infographic charts with design-driven visual elements (e.g., pictograms, icons) requires both visual recognition and reasoning, posing challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing visual-question answering benchmarks fall short in evaluating these capabilities of MLLMs due to the lack of paired plain charts and visual-element-based questions. To bridge this gap, we introduce InfoChartQA, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on infographic chart understanding. It includes 5,642 pairs of infographic and plain charts, each sharing the same underlying data but differing in visual presentations. We further design visual-element-based questions to capture their unique visual designs and communicative intent. Evaluation of 20 MLLMs reveals a substantial performance decline on infographic charts, particularly for visual-element-based questions related to metaphors. The paired infographic and plain charts enable fine-grained error analysis and ablation studies, which highlight new opportunities for advancing MLLMs in infographic chart understanding.

  Recent advances in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in visual reasoning tasks. However, geo-localization presents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual cues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for systematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack robust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE) Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark (GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained (e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex geographic inference.

  Generative AI (GenAI) holds significant promise for automating everyday image editing tasks, especially following the recent release of GPT-4o on March 25, 2025. However, what subjects do people most often want edited? What kinds of editing actions do they want to perform (e.g., removing or stylizing the subject)? Do people prefer precise edits with predictable outcomes or highly creative ones? By understanding the characteristics of real-world requests and the corresponding edits made by freelance photo-editing wizards, can we draw lessons for improving AI-based editors and determine which types of requests can currently be handled successfully by AI editors? In this paper, we present a unique study addressing these questions by analyzing 83k requests from the past 12 years (2013-2025) on the Reddit community, which collected 305k PSR-wizard edits. According to human ratings, approximately only 33% of requests can be fulfilled by the best AI editors (including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, SeedEdit). Interestingly, AI editors perform worse on low-creativity requests that require precise editing than on more open-ended tasks. They often struggle to preserve the identity of people and animals, and frequently make non-requested touch-ups. On the other side of the table, VLM judges (e.g., o1) perform differently from human judges and may prefer AI edits more than human edits.

  The goal of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is to imitate humans and surpass them. Models such as OpenAI's o1, o3, and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) with human-like reasoning capabilities exhibit exceptional performance and are being gradually integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, whether these models possess capabilities comparable to humans in handling reasoning tasks remains unclear at present. In this paper, we propose Human-Aligned Bench, a benchmark for fine-grained alignment of multimodal reasoning with human performance. Specifically, we collected 9,794 multimodal questions that solely rely on contextual reasoning, including bilingual (Chinese and English) multimodal questions and pure text-based questions, encompassing four question types: visual reasoning, definition judgment, analogical reasoning, and logical judgment. More importantly, each question is accompanied by human success rates and options that humans are prone to choosing incorrectly. Extensive experiments on the Human-Aligned Bench reveal notable differences between the performance of current MLLMs in multimodal reasoning and human performance. The findings on our benchmark provide insights into the development of the next-generation models.

  CLIP is one of the most popular foundational models and is heavily used for many vision-language tasks. However, little is known about the inner workings of CLIP. While recent work has proposed decomposition-based interpretability methods for identifying textual descriptions of attention heads in CLIP, the implications of conceptual consistency in these text labels on interpretability and model performance has not been explored. To bridge this gap, we study the conceptual consistency of text descriptions for attention heads in CLIP-like models. We conduct extensive experiments on six different models from OpenAI and OpenCLIP which vary by size, type of pre-training data and patch size. We propose Concept Consistency Score (CCS), a novel interpretability metric that measures how consistently individual attention heads in CLIP models align with specific concepts. To assign concept labels to heads, we use in-context learning with ChatGPT, guided by a few manually-curated examples, and validate these labels using an LLM-as-a-judge approach. Our soft-pruning experiments reveal that high CCS heads are critical for preserving model performance, as pruning them leads to a significantly larger performance drop than pruning random or low CCS heads. Notably, we find that high CCS heads capture essential concepts and play a key role in out-of-domain detection, concept-specific reasoning, and video-language understanding. Moreover, we prove that high CCS heads learn spurious correlations amplifying social biases. These results position CCS as a powerful interpretability metric exposing the paradox of performance and social biases in CLIP models.

  With the growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD), recent studies on point-supervised OOD have attracted significant interest. In this paper, we propose PointOBB-v3, a stronger single point-supervised OOD framework. Compared to existing methods, it generates pseudo rotated boxes without additional priors and incorporates support for the end-to-end paradigm. PointOBB-v3 functions by integrating three unique image views: the original view, a resized view, and a rotated/flipped (rot/flp) view. Based on the views, a scale augmentation module and an angle acquisition module are constructed. In the first module, a Scale-Sensitive Consistency (SSC) loss and a Scale-Sensitive Feature Fusion (SSFF) module are introduced to improve the model's ability to estimate object scale. To achieve precise angle predictions, the second module employs symmetry-based self-supervised learning. Additionally, we introduce an end-to-end version that eliminates the pseudo-label generation process by integrating a detector branch and introduces an Instance-Aware Weighting (IAW) strategy to focus on high-quality predictions. We conducted extensive experiments on the DIOR-R, DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0, FAIR1M, STAR, and RSAR datasets. Across all these datasets, our method achieves an average improvement in accuracy of 3.56% in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available atthis https URL.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive general capabilities across a wide range of multi-modal tasks. However, the reasoning processes of LVLMs often suffer from unreliable outputs and limited interpretability. To address this, grounded visual reasoning has emerged as a promising paradigm that enforces responses anchored on salient visual evidence regions. However, existing approaches typically rely on costly supervision such as bounding box annotations, chain-of-thought rationale or external tool calls, limiting their scalability. In this work, we propose Ground-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enables grounded visual reasoning without requiring explicit evidence or rationale annotations. Ground-R1 consists of a grounding phase that generates evidence region rollouts based on format constraints, and an answering phase that produces responses guided by both answer correctness and format adherence rewards. Extensive experiments across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks manifest that Ground-R1 achieves superior performance and exhibits emergent cognitive behaviors such as uncertainty awareness, spatial perception, and iterative refinement, offering a scalable and interpretable alternative to existing approaches.

  Long-horizon video-audio reasoning and fine-grained pixel understanding impose conflicting requirements on omnimodal models: dense temporal coverage demands many low-resolution frames, whereas precise grounding calls for high-resolution inputs. We tackle this trade-off with a two-system architecture: a Global Reasoning System selects informative keyframes and rewrites the task at low spatial cost, while a Detail Understanding System performs pixel-level grounding on the selected high-resolution snippets. Because ``optimal'' keyframe selection and reformulation are ambiguous and hard to supervise, we formulate them as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and present Omni-R1, an end-to-end RL framework built on Group Relative Policy Optimization. Omni-R1 trains the Global Reasoning System through hierarchical rewards obtained via online collaboration with the Detail Understanding System, requiring only one epoch of RL on small task splits.Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, namely Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (RefAVS) and Reasoning Video Object Segmentation (REVOS), show that Omni-R1 not only surpasses strong supervised baselines but also outperforms specialized state-of-the-art models, while substantially improving out-of-domain generalization and mitigating multimodal hallucination. Our results demonstrate the first successful application of RL to large-scale omnimodal reasoning and highlight a scalable path toward universally foundation models.

  Uncertainty quantification is essential for assessing the reliability and trustworthiness of modern AI systems. Among existing approaches, verbalized uncertainty, where models express their confidence through natural language, has emerged as a lightweight and interpretable solution in large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness in vision-language models (VLMs) remains insufficiently studied. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of verbalized confidence in VLMs, spanning three model categories, four task domains, and three evaluation scenarios. Our results show that current VLMs often display notable miscalibration across diverse tasks and settings. Notably, visual reasoning models (i.e., thinking with images) consistently exhibit better calibration, suggesting that modality-specific reasoning is critical for reliable uncertainty estimation. To further address calibration challenges, we introduce Visual Confidence-Aware Prompting, a two-stage prompting strategy that improves confidence alignment in multimodal settings. Overall, our study highlights the inherent miscalibration in VLMs across modalities. More broadly, our findings underscore the fundamental importance of modality alignment and model faithfulness in advancing reliable multimodal systems.

  The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that unify visual understanding and image generation within a single framework. However, most existing MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent limitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image generation and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we show that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant performance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement through reinforcement learning.

  Recent advancements in reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate its effectiveness in tackling complex visual tasks. However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on VAD and VAR tasks.

  Securing personal identity against deepfake attacks is increasingly critical in the digital age, especially for celebrities and political figures whose faces are easily accessible and frequently targeted. Most existing deepfake detection methods focus on general-purpose scenarios and often ignore the valuable prior knowledge of known facial identities, e.g., "VIP individuals" whose authentic facial data are already available. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VIPGuard}, a unified multimodal framework designed to capture fine-grained and comprehensive facial representations of a given identity, compare them against potentially fake or similar-looking faces, and reason over these comparisons to make accurate and explainable predictions. Specifically, our framework consists of three main stages. First, fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to learn detailed and structural facial attributes. Second, we perform identity-level discriminative learning to enable the model to distinguish subtle differences between highly similar faces, including real and fake variations. Finally, we introduce user-specific customization, where we model the unique characteristics of the target face identity and perform semantic reasoning via MLLM to enable personalized and explainable deepfake detection. Our framework shows clear advantages over previous detection works, where traditional detectors mainly rely on low-level visual cues and provide no human-understandable explanations, while other MLLM-based models often lack a detailed understanding of specific face identities. To facilitate the evaluation of our method, we built a comprehensive identity-aware benchmark called \textbf{VIPBench} for personalized deepfake detection, involving the latest 7 face-swapping and 7 entire face synthesis techniques for generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have significantly accelerated image editing techniques, driving increasing demand for diverse and fine-grained edits. Despite these advances, existing image editing methods still face challenges in achieving high precision and semantic accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent studies address this issue by incorporating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into image editing pipelines. However, current MLLM-based methods mainly rely on interpreting textual instructions, leaving the intrinsic visual understanding of large models largely unexplored, thus resulting in insufficient alignment between textual semantics and visual outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose MIND-Edit, an end-to-end image-editing framework integrating pretrained diffusion model with MLLM. MIND-Edit introduces two complementary strategies: (1) a text instruction optimization strategy that clarifies ambiguous user instructions based on semantic reasoning from the MLLM, and (2) an MLLM insight-driven editing strategy that explicitly leverages the intrinsic visual understanding capability of the MLLM to infer editing intent and guide the diffusion process via generated visual embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a joint training approach to effectively integrate both strategies, allowing them to reinforce each other for more accurate instruction interpretation and visually coherent edits aligned with user intent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIND-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art image editing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly under complex and challenging scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Our research reveals a new privacy risk associated with the vision-language model (VLM) agentic framework: the ability to infer sensitive attributes (e.g., age and health information) and even abstract ones (e.g., personality and social traits) from a set of personal images, which we term "image private attribute profiling." This threat is particularly severe given that modern apps can easily access users' photo albums, and inference from image sets enables models to exploit inter-image relations for more sophisticated profiling. However, two main challenges hinder our understanding of how well VLMs can profile an individual from a few personal photos: (1) the lack of benchmark datasets with multi-image annotations for private attributes, and (2) the limited ability of current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to infer abstract attributes from large image collections. In this work, we construct PAPI, the largest dataset for studying private attribute profiling in personal images, comprising 2,510 images from 251 individuals with 3,012 annotated privacy attributes. We also propose HolmesEye, a hybrid agentic framework that combines VLMs and LLMs to enhance privacy inference. HolmesEye uses VLMs to extract both intra-image and inter-image information and LLMs to guide the inference process as well as consolidate the results through forensic analysis, overcoming existing limitations in long-context visual reasoning. Experiments reveal that HolmesEye achieves a 10.8% improvement in average accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines and surpasses human-level performance by 15.0% in predicting abstract attributes. This work highlights the urgency of addressing privacy risks in image-based profiling and offers both a new dataset and an advanced framework to guide future research in this area.

  Charts are high-density visualization carriers for complex data, serving as a crucial medium for information extraction and analysis. Automated chart understanding poses significant challenges to existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to the need for precise and complex visual reasoning. Current step-by-step reasoning models primarily focus on text-based logical reasoning for chart understanding. However, they struggle to refine or correct their reasoning when errors stem from flawed visual understanding, as they lack the ability to leverage multimodal interaction for deeper comprehension. Inspired by human cognitive behavior, we propose ChartSketcher, a multimodal feedback-driven step-by-step reasoning method designed to address these limitations. ChartSketcher is a chart understanding model that employs Sketch-CoT, enabling MLLMs to annotate intermediate reasoning steps directly onto charts using a programmatic sketching library, iteratively feeding these visual annotations back into the reasoning process. This mechanism enables the model to visually ground its reasoning and refine its understanding over multiple steps. We employ a two-stage training strategy: a cold start phase to learn sketch-based reasoning patterns, followed by off-policy reinforcement learning to enhance reflection and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that ChartSketcher achieves promising performance on chart understanding benchmarks and general vision tasks, providing an interactive and interpretable approach to chart comprehension.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in various 2D visual tasks, yet their readiness for 3D clinical diagnosis remains unclear due to stringent demands for recognition precision, reasoning ability, and domain knowledge. To systematically evaluate these dimensions, we present DeepTumorVQA, a diagnostic visual question answering (VQA) benchmark targeting abdominal tumors in CT scans. It comprises 9,262 CT volumes (3.7M slices) from 17 public datasets, with 395K expert-level questions spanning four categories: Recognition, Measurement, Visual Reasoning, and Medical Reasoning. DeepTumorVQA introduces unique challenges, including small tumor detection and clinical reasoning across 3D anatomy. Benchmarking four advanced VLMs (RadFM, M3D, Merlin, CT-CHAT), we find current models perform adequately on measurement tasks but struggle with lesion recognition and reasoning, and are still not meeting clinical needs. Two key insights emerge: (1) large-scale multimodal pretraining plays a crucial role in DeepTumorVQA testing performance, making RadFM stand out among all VLMs. (2) Our dataset exposes critical differences in VLM components, where proper image preprocessing and design of vision modules significantly affect 3D perception. To facilitate medical multimodal research, we have released DeepTumorVQA as a rigorous benchmark:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in AI-powered generative models have enabled the creation of increasingly realistic synthetic images, posing significant risks to information integrity and public trust on social media platforms. While robust detection frameworks and diverse, large-scale datasets are essential to mitigate these risks, existing academic efforts remain limited in scope: current datasets lack the diversity, scale, and realism required for social media contexts, while detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen generative technologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce So-Fake-Set, a comprehensive social media-oriented dataset with over 2 million high-quality images, diverse generative sources, and photorealistic imagery synthesized using 35 state-of-the-art generative models. To rigorously evaluate cross-domain robustness, we establish a novel and large-scale (100K) out-of-domain benchmark (So-Fake-OOD) featuring synthetic imagery from commercial models explicitly excluded from the training distribution, creating a realistic testbed for evaluating real-world performance. Leveraging these resources, we present So-Fake-R1, an advanced vision-language framework that employs reinforcement learning for highly accurate forgery detection, precise localization, and explainable inference through interpretable visual rationales. Extensive experiments show that So-Fake-R1 outperforms the second-best method, with a 1.3% gain in detection accuracy and a 4.5% increase in localization IoU. By integrating a scalable dataset, a challenging OOD benchmark, and an advanced detection framework, this work establishes a new foundation for social media-centric forgery detection research. The code, models, and datasets will be released publicly.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning Video Object Segmentation is a challenging task, which generates a mask sequence from an input video and an implicit, complex text query. Existing works probe into the problem by finetuning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for segmentation-based output, while still falling short in difficult cases on videos given temporally-sensitive queries, primarily due to the failure to integrate temporal and spatial information. In this paper, we propose ThinkVideo, a novel framework which leverages the zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capability of MLLM to address these challenges. Specifically, ThinkVideo utilizes the CoT prompts to extract object selectivities associated with particular keyframes, then bridging the reasoning image segmentation model and SAM2 video processor to output mask sequences. The ThinkVideo framework is training-free and compatible with closed-source MLLMs, which can be applied to Reasoning Video Instance Segmentation. We further extend the framework for online video streams, where the CoT is used to update the object of interest when a better target starts to emerge and becomes visible. We conduct extensive experiments on video object segmentation with explicit and implicit queries. The results show that ThinkVideo significantly outperforms previous works in both cases, qualitatively and quantitatively.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they lag significantly behind humans in spatial reasoning. We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual Reasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object transformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1 rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios. Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning. Our work provides critical insights in advancing the research of MLLMs and reasoning models. The codes, model weights, and data will be publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities in multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet they are primarily constrained by text-based reasoning processes. However, achieving seamless integration of visual and textual reasoning which mirrors human cognitive processes remains a significant challenge. In particular, effectively incorporating advanced visual input processing into reasoning mechanisms is still an open question. Thus, in this paper, we explore the interleaved multimodal reasoning paradigm and introduce DeepEyes, a model with "thinking with images" capabilities incentivized through end-to-end reinforcement learning without the need for cold-start SFT. Notably, this ability emerges natively within the model itself, leveraging its inherent grounding ability as a tool instead of depending on separate specialized models. Specifically, we propose a tool-use-oriented data selection mechanism and a reward strategy to encourage successful tool-assisted reasoning trajectories. DeepEyes achieves significant performance gains on fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks and also demonstrates improvement in grounding, hallucination, and mathematical reasoning tasks. Interestingly, we observe the distinct evolution of tool-calling behavior from initial exploration to efficient and accurate exploitation, and diverse thinking patterns that closely mirror human visual reasoning processes.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, they often struggle with accurate counting, attributes, and spatial relationships in complex multi-object scenes. One potential approach is to utilize Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to build a self-correction framework. However, these approaches are highly dependent on the capabilities of the employed MLLM, often failing to account for all objects within the image. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that employs Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting, enhancing image-text alignment and facilitating more coherent multi-object image editing. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, decomposing the self-correction task into object-level subtasks according to three critical dimensions: counting, attributes, and spatial relationships. We construct a multi-agent self-correcting system featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To resolve the problem of subtask integration, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother that employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtask results, thereby enhancing runtime efficiency while eliminating multi-stage distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Next-token prediction is the fundamental principle for training large language models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning (RL) further enhances their reasoning performance. As an effective way to model language, image, video, and other modalities, the use of LLMs for end-to-end extraction of structured visual representations, such as scene graphs, remains underexplored. It requires the model to accurately produce a set of objects and relationship triplets, rather than generating text token by token. To achieve this, we introduce R1-SGG, a multimodal LLM (M-LLM) initially trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the scene graph dataset and subsequently refined using reinforcement learning to enhance its ability to generate scene graphs in an end-to-end manner. The SFT follows a conventional prompt-response paradigm, while RL requires the design of effective reward signals. We design a set of graph-centric rewards, including three recall-based variants -- Hard Recall, Hard Recall+Relax, and Soft Recall -- which evaluate semantic and spatial alignment between predictions and ground truth at the object and relation levels. A format consistency reward further ensures that outputs follow the expected structural schema. Extensive experiments on the VG150 and PSG benchmarks show that R1-SGG substantially reduces failure rates and achieves strong performance in Recall and mean Recall, surpassing traditional SGG models and existing multimodal language models.

  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have strengthened the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, enhancing policy exploration to better scale test-time compute remains largely underexplored. In addition, VLMs continue to struggle with imperfect visual perception, which in turn affects the subsequent reasoning process. To this end, we propose NoisyRollout, a simple yet effective data augmentation method that mixes trajectories from both clean and moderately distorted images during RL training. By injecting targeted diversity in visual perception and the resulting reasoning patterns, NoisyRollout promotes better policy exploration through vision-oriented inductive biases, ultimately leading to more robust reasoning behaviors. We further adopt a noise annealing schedule that gradually reduces distortion strength over training, leveraging noisy signals early on while ensuring training stability in later stages. Crucially, our method is easy-to-adopt--requiring no additional training cost and no modifications to the RL objective. Extensive experiments on $2$ distinct training datasets demonstrate that NoisyRollout achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source RL-tuned models across $5$ out-of-domain reasoning and perception benchmarks. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of NoisyRollout across model sizes ($7$B and $32$B) and data scales (from $1$K to $6$K), highlighting its generalizability and scalability.

  Recent advances in LVLMs have improved vision-language understanding, but they still struggle with spatial perception, limiting their ability to reason about complex 3D scenes. Unlike previous approaches that incorporate 3D representations into models to improve spatial understanding, we aim to unlock the potential of VLMs by leveraging spatially relevant image data. To this end, we introduce a novel 2D spatial data generation and annotation pipeline built upon scene data with 3D ground-truth. This pipeline enables the creation of a diverse set of spatial tasks, ranging from basic perception tasks to more complex reasoning tasks. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct SPAR-7M, a large-scale dataset generated from thousands of scenes across multiple public datasets. In addition, we introduce SPAR-Bench, a benchmark designed to offer a more comprehensive evaluation of spatial capabilities compared to existing spatial benchmarks, supporting both single-view and multi-view inputs. Training on both SPAR-7M and large-scale 2D datasets enables our models to achieve state-of-the-art performance on 2D spatial benchmarks. Further fine-tuning on 3D task-specific datasets yields competitive results, underscoring the effectiveness of our dataset in enhancing spatial reasoning.

  Multi-view 3D visual grounding is critical for autonomous driving vehicles to interpret natural languages and localize target objects in complex environments. However, existing datasets and methods suffer from coarse-grained language instructions, and inadequate integration of 3D geometric reasoning with linguistic comprehension. To this end, we introduce NuGrounding, the first large-scale benchmark for multi-view 3D visual grounding in autonomous driving. We present a Hierarchy of Grounding (HoG) method to construct NuGrounding to generate hierarchical multi-level instructions, ensuring comprehensive coverage of human instruction patterns. To tackle this challenging dataset, we propose a novel paradigm that seamlessly combines instruction comprehension abilities of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) with precise localization abilities of specialist detection models. Our approach introduces two decoupled task tokens and a context query to aggregate 3D geometric information and semantic instructions, followed by a fusion decoder to refine spatial-semantic feature fusion for precise localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines adapted from representative 3D scene understanding methods by a significant margin and achieves 0.59 in precision and 0.64 in recall, with improvements of 50.8% and 54.7%.

  While text-to-image generation has been extensively studied, generating images from scene graphs remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to challenges in accurately modeling spatial relationships and object interactions. To fill this gap, we introduce Scene-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance the factual consistency in generating natural scenes. Scene-Bench comprises MegaSG, a large-scale dataset of one million images annotated with scene graphs, facilitating the training and fair comparison of models across diverse and complex scenes. Additionally, we propose SGScore, a novel evaluation metric that leverages chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs) to assess both object presence and relationship accuracy, offering a more effective measure of factual consistency than traditional metrics like FID and CLIPScore. Building upon this evaluation framework, we develop a scene graph feedback pipeline that iteratively refines generated images by identifying and correcting discrepancies between the scene graph and the image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scene-Bench provides a more comprehensive and effective evaluation framework compared to existing benchmarks, particularly for complex scene generation. Furthermore, our feedback strategy significantly enhances the factual consistency of image generation models, advancing the field of controllable image generation.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across multimodal tasks such as visual perception and reasoning, leading to good performance on various multimodal evaluation benchmarks. However, these benchmarks keep a static nature and overlap with the pre-training data, resulting in fixed complexity constraints and data contamination issues. This raises the concern regarding the validity of the evaluation. To address these two challenges, we introduce a dynamic multimodal evaluation protocol called Vision-Language Bootstrapping (VLB). VLB provides a robust and comprehensive assessment for LVLMs with reduced data contamination and flexible complexity. To this end, VLB dynamically generates new visual question-answering samples through a multimodal bootstrapping module that modifies both images and language, while ensuring that newly generated samples remain consistent with the original ones by a judge module. By composing various bootstrapping strategies, VLB offers dynamic variants of existing benchmarks with diverse complexities, enabling the evaluation to co-evolve with the ever-evolving capabilities of LVLMs. Extensive experimental results across multiple benchmarks, including SEEDBench, MMBench, and MME, show that VLB significantly reduces data contamination and exposes performance limitations of LVLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) have been widely explored for automated scoring in low-stakes assessment to facilitate learning and instruction. Empirical evidence related to which LLM produces the most reliable scores and induces least rater effects needs to be collected before the use of LLMs for automated scoring in practice. This study compared ten LLMs (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, ChatGPT 4o, OpenAI o1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 2.0, as well as DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek R1) with human expert raters in scoring two types of writing tasks. The accuracy of the holistic and analytic scores from LLMs compared with human raters was evaluated in terms of Quadratic Weighted Kappa. Intra-rater consistency across prompts was compared in terms of Cronbach Alpha. Rater effects of LLMs were evaluated and compared with human raters using the Many-Facet Rasch model. The results in general supported the use of ChatGPT 4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet with high scoring accuracy, better rater reliability, and less rater effects.

While TPPs have been widely studied for modeling temporal event sequences, existing datasets are predominantly unimodal, hindering progress in models that require joint reasoning over temporal, textual, and visual information. To address this gap, DanmakuTPPBench comprises two complementary components: (1) DanmakuTPP-Events, a novel dataset derived from the Bilibili video platform, where user-generated bullet comments (Danmaku) naturally form multi-modal events annotated with precise timestamps, rich textual content, and corresponding video frames; (2) DanmakuTPP-QA, a challenging question-answering dataset constructed via a novel multi-agent pipeline powered by state-of-the-art LLMs and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), targeting complex temporal-textual-visual reasoning. We conduct extensive evaluations using both classical TPP models and recent MLLMs, revealing significant performance gaps and limitations in current methods' ability to model multi-modal event dynamics. Our benchmark establishes strong baselines and calls for further integration of TPP modeling into the multi-modal language modeling landscape. The code and dataset have been released atthis https URL

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to solve reasoning and mathematical problems using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. Expanding CoT length, as seen in models such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly enhances this reasoning for complex problems, but requires costly and high-quality long CoT data and fine-tuning. This work, inspired by the deep thinking paradigm of DeepSeek-R1, utilizes a steering technique to enhance the reasoning ability of an LLM without external datasets. Our method first employs Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable features from vanilla CoT. These features are then used to steer the LLM's internal states during generation. Recognizing that many LLMs do not have corresponding pre-trained SAEs, we further introduce a novel SAE-free steering algorithm, which directly computes steering directions from the residual activations of an LLM, obviating the need for an explicit SAE. Experimental results demonstrate that both our SAE-based and subsequent SAE-free steering algorithms significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance across diverse domains but often suffer from overconfidence, limiting their reliability in critical applications. We propose SteerConf, a novel framework that systematically steers LLMs' confidence scores to improve their calibration and reliability. SteerConf introduces three key components: (1) a steering prompt strategy that guides LLMs to produce confidence scores in specified directions (e.g., conservative or optimistic) by leveraging prompts with varying steering levels; (2) a steered confidence consistency measure that quantifies alignment across multiple steered confidences to enhance calibration; and (3) a steered confidence calibration method that aggregates confidence scores using consistency measures and applies linear quantization for answer selection. SteerConf operates without additional training or fine-tuning, making it broadly applicable to existing LLMs. Experiments on seven benchmarks spanning professional knowledge, common sense, ethics, and reasoning tasks, using advanced LLM models (GPT-3.5, LLaMA 3, GPT-4), demonstrate that SteerConf significantly outperforms existing methods, often by a significant margin. Our findings highlight the potential of steering the confidence of LLMs to enhance their reliability for safer deployment in real-world applications.

  Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) methods focus on tasks that demand reasoning with information extending beyond the explicit content depicted in the image. Early methods relied on explicit knowledge bases to provide this auxiliary information. Recent approaches leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as implicit knowledge sources. While KB-VQA methods have demonstrated promising results, their potential remains constrained as the auxiliary text provided may not be relevant to the question context, and may also include irrelevant information that could misguide the answer predictor. We introduce a novel four-stage framework called Grounding Caption-Guided Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (GC-KBVQA), which enables LLMs to effectively perform zero-shot VQA tasks without the need for end-to-end multimodal training. Innovations include grounding question-aware caption generation to move beyond generic descriptions and have compact, yet detailed and context-rich information. This is combined with knowledge from external sources to create highly informative prompts for the LLM. GC-KBVQA can address a variety of VQA tasks, and does not require task-specific fine-tuning, thus reducing both costs and deployment complexity by leveraging general-purpose, pre-trained LLMs. Comparison with competing KB-VQA methods shows significantly improved performance. Our code will be made public.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained significant attention for its simplicity and computational efficiency in aligning large language models (LLMs). Recent advancements have extended DPO to multimodal scenarios, achieving strong performance. However, traditional DPO relies on binary preference optimization, rewarding or penalizing entire responses without considering fine-grained segment correctness, leading to suboptimal solutions. The root of this issue lies in the absence of fine-grained supervision during the optimization process. To address this, we propose Adaptive Sentence-level Preference Optimization (ASPO), which evaluates individual sentences for more precise preference optimization. By dynamically calculating adaptive rewards at the sentence level based on model predictions, ASPO enhances response content assessment without additional models or parameters. This significantly improves the alignment of multimodal features. Extensive experiments show that ASPO substantially enhances the overall performance of multimodal models.

  Applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) shows significant promise for complex video reasoning. However, popular Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) methods, such as outcome-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are limited by data preparation bottlenecks (e.g., noise or high cost) and exhibit unstable improvements in the quality of long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) and downstreamthis http URLaddress these limitations, we propose VerIPO, a Verifier-guided Iterative Policy Optimization method designed to gradually improve video LLMs' capacity for generating deep, long-term reasoning chains. The core component is Rollout-Aware Verifier, positioned between the GRPO and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training phases to form the GRPO-Verifier-DPO training loop. This verifier leverages small LLMs as a judge to assess the reasoning logic of rollouts, enabling the construction of high-quality contrastive data, including reflective and contextually consistent CoTs. These curated preference samples drive the efficient DPO stage (7x faster than GRPO), leading to marked improvements in reasoning chain quality, especially in terms of length and contextual consistency. This training loop benefits from GRPO's expansive search and DPO's targeted optimization. Experimental results demonstrate: 1) Significantly faster and more effective optimization compared to standard GRPO variants, yielding superior performance; 2) Our trained models exceed the direct inference of large-scale instruction-tuned Video-LLMs, producing long and contextually consistent CoTs on diverse video reasoning tasks; and 3) Our model with one iteration outperforms powerful LMMs (e.g., Kimi-VL) and long reasoning models (e.g., Video-R1), highlighting its effectiveness and stability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present v1, a lightweight extension to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that enables selective visual revisitation during inference. While current MLLMs typically consume visual input only once and reason purely over internal memory, v1 introduces a simple point-and-copy mechanism that allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant image regions throughout the reasoning process. This mechanism augments existing architectures with minimal modifications, enabling contextual access to visual tokens based on the model's evolving hypotheses. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of 300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations. Experiments on three multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks -- MathVista, MathVision, and MathVerse -- demonstrate that v1 consistently improves performance over comparable baselines, particularly on tasks requiring fine-grained visual reference and multi-step reasoning. Our results suggest that dynamic visual access is a promising direction for enhancing grounded multimodal reasoning. Code, models, and data will be released to support future research.

  Visual language is a system of communication that conveys information through symbols, shapes, and spatial arrangements. Diagrams are a typical example of a visual language depicting complex concepts and their relationships in the form of an image. The symbolic nature of diagrams presents significant challenges for building models capable of understanding them. Recent studies suggest that Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can even tackle complex reasoning tasks involving diagrams. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon by developing a comprehensive test suite to evaluate the diagram comprehension capability of LVLMs. Our test suite uses a variety of questions focused on concept entities and their relationships over a set of synthetic as well as real diagrams across domains to evaluate the recognition and reasoning abilities of models. Our evaluation of LVLMs shows that while they can accurately identify and reason about entities, their ability to understand relationships is notably limited. Further testing reveals that the decent performance on diagram understanding largely stems from leveraging their background knowledge as shortcuts to identify and reason about the relational information. Thus, we conclude that LVLMs have a limited capability for genuine diagram understanding, and their impressive performance in diagram reasoning is an illusion emanating from other confounding factors, such as the background knowledge in the models.

  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results across diverse downstream tasks, but their monolithic nature restricts scalability and efficiency in complex problem-solving. While recent research explores multi-agent collaboration among LLMs, most approaches rely on static organizational structures that struggle to adapt as task complexity and agent numbers grow, resulting in coordination overhead and inefficiencies. To this end, we propose a puppeteer-style paradigm for LLM-based multi-agent collaboration, where a centralized orchestrator ("puppeteer") dynamically directs agents ("puppets") in response to evolving task states. This orchestrator is trained via reinforcement learning to adaptively sequence and prioritize agents, enabling flexible and evolvable collective reasoning. Experiments on closed- and open-domain scenarios show that this method achieves superior performance with reduced computational costs. Analyses further reveal that the key improvements consistently stem from the emergence of more compact, cyclic reasoning structures under the orchestrator's evolution.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong generalization and reasoning abilities, making them well-suited for complex decision-making tasks such as medical consultation (MC). However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to capture the dual nature of MC, which entails two distinct sub-tasks: symptom inquiry, a sequential decision-making process, and disease diagnosis, a classification problem. This mismatch often results in ineffective symptom inquiry and unreliable disease diagnosis. To address this, we propose \textbf{DDO}, a novel LLM-based framework that performs \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{D}ecision \textbf{O}ptimization by decoupling and independently optimizing the the two sub-tasks through a collaborative multi-agent workflow. Experiments on three real-world MC datasets show that DDO consistently outperforms existing LLM-based approaches and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art generation-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in the MC task.

  Recent advances such as Chain-of-Thought prompting have significantly improved large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot medical reasoning. However, prompting-based methods often remain shallow and unstable, while fine-tuned medical LLMs suffer from poor generalization under distribution shifts and limited adaptability to unseen clinical scenarios. To address these limitations, we present TAGS, a test-time framework that combines a broadly capable generalist with a domain-specific specialist to offer complementary perspectives without any model fine-tuning or parameter updates. To support this generalist-specialist reasoning process, we introduce two auxiliary modules: a hierarchical retrieval mechanism that provides multi-scale exemplars by selecting examples based on both semantic and rationale-level similarity, and a reliability scorer that evaluates reasoning consistency to guide final answer aggregation. TAGS achieves strong performance across nine MedQA benchmarks, boosting GPT-4o accuracy by 13.8%, DeepSeek-R1 by 16.8%, and improving a vanilla 7B model from 14.1% to 23.9%. These results surpass several fine-tuned medical LLMs, without any parameter updates. The code will be available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT)-the task of translating textual content embedded in images-is critical for applications in accessibility, cross-lingual information access, and real-world document understanding. However, TIMT remains a complex challenge due to the need for accurate optical character recognition (OCR), robust visual-text reasoning, and high-quality translation, often requiring cascading multi-stage pipelines. Recent advances in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) have improved reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), but their application to end-to-end TIMT is still underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT$^{3}$, the first framework to apply Multi-Task RL to MLLMs for end-to-end TIMT. MT$^{3}$ adopts a multi-task optimization paradigm targeting three key sub-skills: text recognition, context-aware reasoning, and translation. It is trained using a novel multi-mixed reward mechanism that adapts rule-based RL strategies to TIMT's intricacies, offering fine-grained, non-binary feedback across tasks. Furthermore, to facilitate the evaluation of TIMT in authentic cross-cultural and real-world social media contexts, we introduced XHSPost, the first social media TIMT benchmark. Our MT$^{3}$-7B-Zero achieves state-of-the-art results on the latest in-domain MIT-10M benchmark, outperforming strong baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B by notable margins across multiple metrics. Additionally, the model shows strong generalization to out-of-distribution language pairs and datasets. In-depth analyses reveal how multi-task synergy, reinforcement learning initialization, curriculum design, and reward formulation contribute to advancing MLLM-driven TIMT.

  Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of large language models (LLMs), motivating a growing body of work on prompt optimization. Most existing methods optimize prompts over a fixed dataset, assuming static input distributions and offering limited support for iterative improvement. We introduce SIPDO (Self-Improving Prompts through Data-Augmented Optimization), a closed-loop framework for prompt learning that integrates synthetic data generation into the optimization process. SIPDO couples a synthetic data generator with a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that reveal current prompt weaknesses and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. This feedback-driven loop enables systematic improvement of prompt performance without assuming access to external supervision or new tasks. Experiments across question answering and reasoning benchmarks show that SIPDO outperforms standard prompt tuning methods, highlighting the value of integrating data synthesis into prompt learning workflows.

  Large language model (LLM) research has grown rapidly, along with increasing concern about their limitations such as failures in reasoning, hallucinations, and limited multilingual capability. In this survey, we conduct a data-driven, semi-automated review of research on limitations of LLM (LLLMs) from 2022 to 2024 using a bottom-up approach. From a corpus of 250,000 ACL and arXiv papers, we identify 14,648 relevant papers using keyword filtering, LLM-based classification, validated against expert labels, and topic clustering (via two approaches, HDBSCAN+BERTopic and LlooM). We find that LLM-related research increases over fivefold in ACL and fourfold in arXiv. Since 2022, LLLMs research grows even faster, reaching over 30% of LLM papers by late 2024. Reasoning remains the most studied limitation, followed by generalization, hallucination, bias, and security. The distribution of topics in the ACL dataset stays relatively stable over time, while arXiv shifts toward safety and controllability (with topics like security risks, alignment, hallucinations, knowledge editing), and multimodality between 2022 and 2024. We release a dataset of annotated abstracts and a validated methodology, and offer a quantitative view of trends in LLM limitations research.

  Can LLMs accurately adjust their confidence when facing opposition? Building on previous studies measuring calibration on static fact-based question-answering tasks, we evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in a dynamic, adversarial debate setting, uniquely combining two realistic factors: (a) a multi-turn format requiring models to update beliefs as new information emerges, and (b) a zero-sum structure to control for task-related uncertainty, since mutual high-confidence claims imply systematic overconfidence. We organized 60 three-round policy debates among ten state-of-the-art LLMs, with models privately rating their confidence (0-100) in winning after each round. We observed five concerning patterns: (1) Systematic overconfidence: models began debates with average initial confidence of 72.9% vs. a rational 50% baseline. (2) Confidence escalation: rather than reducing confidence as debates progressed, debaters increased their win probabilities, averaging 83% by the final round. (3) Mutual overestimation: in 61.7% of debates, both sides simultaneously claimed >=75% probability of victory, a logical impossibility. (4) Persistent self-debate bias: models debating identical copies increased confidence from 64.1% to 75.2%; even when explicitly informed their chance of winning was exactly 50%, confidence still rose (from 50.0% to 57.1%). (5) Misaligned private reasoning: models' private scratchpad thoughts sometimes differed from their public confidence ratings, raising concerns about faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning. These results suggest LLMs lack the ability to accurately self-assess or update their beliefs in dynamic, multi-turn tasks; a major concern as LLM outputs are deployed without careful review in assistant roles or agentic settings.

  We introduce Grade School Math with Distracting Context (GSM-DC), a synthetic benchmark to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning robustness against systematically controlled irrelevant context (IC). GSM-DC constructs symbolic reasoning graphs with precise distractor injections, enabling rigorous, reproducible evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs are significantly sensitive to IC, affecting both reasoning path selection and arithmetic accuracy. Additionally, training models with strong distractors improves performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We further propose a stepwise tree search guided by a process reward model, which notably enhances robustness in out-of-distribution conditions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) still struggle across tasks outside of high-resource languages. In this work, we investigate cross-lingual transfer to lower-resource languages where task-specific post-training data is scarce. Building on prior work, we first validate that the subsets of model parameters that matter most for mathematical reasoning and multilingual capabilities are distinctly non-overlapping. To exploit this implicit separability between task and target language parameterization, we develop and analyze numerous modular frameworks to improve the composition of the two during fine-tuning. These methods generally employ freezing parameters or post hoc model merging to assign math and language improvement to different key parts of the LLM. In the absence of in-language math data, we demonstrate that the modular approaches successfully improve upon baselines across three languages, four models, and two fine-tuning paradigms (full and LoRA). Furthermore, we identify the most consistently successful modular method to be fine-tuning separate language and math experts and model merging via Layer-Swapping, somewhat surprisingly. We offer possible explanations for this result via recent works on the linearity of task vectors. We further explain this by empirically showing that reverting less useful fine-tuning updates after training often outperforms freezing them from the start.

  Refusal discovery is the task of identifying the full set of topics that a language model refuses to discuss. We introduce this new problem setting and develop a refusal discovery method, LLM-crawler, that uses token prefilling to find forbidden topics. We benchmark the LLM-crawler on Tulu-3-8B, an open-source model with public safety tuning data. Our crawler manages to retrieve 31 out of 36 topics within a budget of 1000 prompts. Next, we scale the crawl to a frontier model using the prefilling option of Claude-Haiku. Finally, we crawl three widely used open-weight models: Llama-3.3-70B and two of its variants finetuned for reasoning: DeepSeek-R1-70B and Perplexity-R1-1776-70B. DeepSeek-R1-70B reveals patterns consistent with censorship tuning: The model exhibits "thought suppression" behavior that indicates memorization of CCP-aligned responses. Although Perplexity-R1-1776-70B is robust to censorship, LLM-crawler elicits CCP-aligned refusals answers in the quantized model. Our findings highlight the critical need for refusal discovery methods to detect biases, boundaries, and alignment failures of AI systems.

  We propose SLOT (Sample-specific Language Model Optimization at Test-time), a novel and parameter-efficient test-time inference approach that enhances a language model's ability to more accurately respond to individual prompts. Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex instructions, leading to poor performances on those not well represented among general samples. To address this, SLOT conducts few optimization steps at test-time to update a light-weight sample-specific parameter vector. It is added to the final hidden layer before the output head, and enables efficient adaptation by caching the last layer features during per-sample optimization. By minimizing the cross-entropy loss on the input prompt only, SLOT helps the model better aligned with and follow each given instruction. In experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms the compared models across multiple benchmarks and LLMs. For example, Qwen2.5-7B with SLOT achieves an accuracy gain of 8.6% on GSM8K from 57.54% to 66.19%, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B with SLOT achieves a SOTA accuracy of 68.69% on GPQA among 70B-level models.

  The surge of LLM studies makes synthesizing their findings challenging. Analysis of experimental results from literature can uncover important trends across studies, but the time-consuming nature of manual data extraction limits its use. Our study presents a semi-automated approach for literature analysis that accelerates data extraction using LLMs. It automatically identifies relevant arXiv papers, extracts experimental results and related attributes, and organizes them into a structured dataset, LLMEvalDB. We then conduct an automated literature analysis of frontier LLMs, reducing the effort of paper surveying and data extraction by more than 93% compared to manual approaches. We validate LLMEvalDB by showing that it reproduces key findings from a recent manual analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and also uncovers new insights that go beyond it, showing, for example, that in-context examples benefit coding & multimodal tasks but offer limited gains in math reasoning tasks compared to zero-shot CoT. Our automatically updatable dataset enables continuous tracking of target models by extracting evaluation studies as new data becomes available. Through LLMEvalDB and empirical analysis, we provide insights into LLMs while facilitating ongoing literature analyses of their behavior.

  Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have greatly enhanced their capability to jointly process text and images. However, despite extensive benchmarks evaluating visual comprehension (e.g., diagrams, color schemes, OCR tasks...), there is limited assessment of VLMs' ability to read and reason about text-rich images effectively. To fill this gap, we introduce ReadBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reading comprehension capabilities of VLMs. ReadBench transposes contexts from established text-only benchmarks into images of text while keeping textual prompts and questions intact. Evaluating leading VLMs with ReadBench, we find minimal-but-present performance degradation on short, text-image inputs, while performance sharply declines for longer, multi-page contexts. Our experiments further reveal that text resolution has negligible effects on multimodal performance. These findings highlight needed improvements in VLMs, particularly their reasoning over visually presented extensive textual content, a capability critical for practical applications.

  Standing in 2025, at a critical juncture in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) and has led to the development of cutting-edge AI models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Moreover, the efficient application of RFT to enhance the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has attracted widespread attention from the community. In this position paper, we argue that reinforcement fine-tuning powers the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models. To begin with, we provide a detailed introduction to the fundamental background knowledge that researchers interested in this field should be familiar with. Furthermore, we meticulously summarize the improvements of RFT in powering reasoning capability of MLLMs into five key points: diverse modalities, diverse tasks and domains, better training algorithms, abundant benchmarks and thriving engineering frameworks. Finally, we propose five promising directions for future research that the community might consider. We hope that this position paper will provide valuable insights to the community at this pivotal stage in the advancement toward AGI.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) furnish large language models (LLMs) with iterative retrievals of relevant information to handle complex multi-hop questions. These methods typically alternate between LLM reasoning and retrieval to accumulate external information into the LLM's context. However, the ever-growing context inherently imposes an increasing burden on the LLM to perceive connections among critical information pieces, with futile reasoning steps further exacerbating this overload issue. In this paper, we present KnowTrace, an elegant RAG framework to (1) mitigate the context overload and (2) bootstrap higher-quality multi-step reasoning. Instead of simply piling the retrieved contents, KnowTrace autonomously traces out desired knowledge triplets to organize a specific knowledge graph relevant to the input question. Such a structured workflow not only empowers the LLM with an intelligible context for inference, but also naturally inspires a reflective mechanism of knowledge backtracing to identify contributive LLM generations as process supervision data for self-bootstrapping. Extensive experiments show that KnowTrace consistently surpasses existing methods across three multi-hop question answering benchmarks, and the bootstrapped version further amplifies the gains.

  Assessing higher-order thinking skills in large language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge, especially in tasks that go beyond surface-level accuracy. In this work, we propose THiNK (Testing Higher-order Notion of Knowledge), a multi-agent, feedback-driven evaluation framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy. THiNK frames reasoning assessment as an iterative task of problem generation, critique, and revision, encouraging LLMs to think-aloud through step-by-step reflection and refinement. This enables a systematic evaluation of both lower-order (e.g., remember, understand) and higher-order (e.g., evaluate, create) thinking skills. We apply THiNK to seven state-of-the-art LLMs and perform a detailed cognitive analysis of their outputs. Results reveal that while models reliably perform lower-order categories well, they struggle with applying knowledge in realistic contexts and exhibit limited abstraction. Structured feedback loops significantly improve reasoning performance, particularly in higher-order thinking. Qualitative evaluations further confirm that THiNK-guided outputs better align with domain logic and problem structure. The code of our framework provides a scalable methodology for probing and enhancing LLM reasoning, offering new directions for evaluation grounded in learning science, which is available at our GitHub repository.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on reasoning-intensive tasks, but enhancing their reasoning abilities typically relies on either reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable signals or supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) demonstrations, both of which are expensive. In this paper, we study a novel problem of incentivizing the reasoning capacity of LLMs without expensive high-quality demonstrations and reinforcement learning. We investigate whether the reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be effectively incentivized via supervision from significantly weaker models. We further analyze when and why such weak supervision succeeds in eliciting reasoning abilities in stronger models. Our findings show that supervision from significantly weaker reasoners can substantially improve student reasoning performance, recovering close to 94% of the gains of expensive RL at a fraction of the cost. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures demonstrate that weak reasoners can effectively incentivize reasoning in stronger student models, consistently improving performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Our results suggest that this simple weak-to-strong paradigm is a promising and generalizable alternative to costly methods for incentivizing strong reasoning capabilities at inference-time in LLMs. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1, excel at advanced reasoning tasks like math and coding via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but still struggle with puzzles solvable by humans without domain knowledge. We introduce Enigmata, the first comprehensive suite tailored for improving LLMs with puzzle reasoning skills. It includes 36 tasks across seven categories, each with 1) a generator that produces unlimited examples with controllable difficulty and 2) a rule-based verifier for automatic evaluation. This generator-verifier design supports scalable, multi-task RL training, fine-grained analysis, and seamless RLVR integration. We further propose Enigmata-Eval, a rigorous benchmark, and develop optimized multi-task RLVR strategies. Our trained model, Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata, consistently surpasses o3-mini-high and o1 on the puzzle reasoning benchmarks like Enigmata-Eval, ARC-AGI (32.8%), and ARC-AGI 2 (0.6%). It also generalizes well to out-of-domain puzzle benchmarks and mathematical reasoning, with little multi-tasking trade-off. When trained on larger models like Seed1.5-Thinking (20B activated parameters and 200B total parameters), puzzle data from Enigmata further boosts SoTA performance on advanced math and STEM reasoning tasks such as AIME (2024-2025), BeyondAIME and GPQA (Diamond), showing nice generalization benefits of Enigmata.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel framework for comprehending the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through the perspective of meta-learning. By conceptualizing reasoning trajectories as pseudo-gradient descent updates to the LLM's parameters, we identify parallels between LLM reasoning and various meta-learning paradigms. We formalize the training process for reasoning tasks as a meta-learning setup, with each question treated as an individual task, and reasoning trajectories serving as the inner loop optimization for adapting model parameters. Once trained on a diverse set of questions, the LLM develops fundamental reasoning capabilities that can generalize to previously unseen questions. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the strong connection between LLM reasoning and meta-learning, exploring several issues of significant interest from a meta-learning standpoint. Our work not only enhances the understanding of LLM reasoning but also provides practical insights for improving these models through established meta-learning techniques.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, especially during multi-hop and reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematical problem solving. While Outcome Reward Models verify only final answers, Process Reward Models (PRMs) score each intermediate step to steer generation toward coherent solutions. We introduce PathFinder-PRM, a novel hierarchical, error-aware discriminative PRM that first classifies math and consistency errors at each step, then combines these fine-grained signals to estimate step correctness. To train PathFinder-PRM, we construct a 400K-sample dataset by enriching the human-annotated PRM800K corpus and RLHFlow Mistral traces with three-dimensional step-level labels. On PRMBench, PathFinder-PRM achieves a new state-of-the-art PRMScore of 67.7, outperforming the prior best (65.5) while using 3 times less data. When applied to reward guided greedy search, our model yields prm@8 48.3, a +1.5 point gain over the strongest baseline. These results demonstrate that decoupled error detection and reward estimation not only boost fine-grained error detection but also substantially improve end-to-end, reward-guided mathematical reasoning with greater data efficiency.

  Counterfactual reasoning typically involves considering alternatives to actual events. While often applied to understand past events, a distinct form-forward counterfactual reasoning-focuses on anticipating plausible future developments. This type of reasoning is invaluable in dynamic financial markets, where anticipating market developments can powerfully unveil potential risks and opportunities for stakeholders, guiding their decision-making. However, performing this at scale is challenging due to the cognitive demands involved, underscoring the need for automated solutions. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, but remain unexplored for this application. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark, Fin-Force-FINancial FORward Counterfactual Evaluation. By curating financial news headlines and providing structured evaluation, Fin-Force supports LLM based forward counterfactual generation. This paves the way for scalable and automated solutions for exploring and anticipating future market developments, thereby providing structured insights for decision-making. Through experiments on Fin-Force, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and counterfactual generation methods, analyzing their limitations and proposing insights for future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through test-time scaling approaches, particularly when fine-tuned with chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from more powerful large reasoning models (LRMs). However, these reasoning chains often contain verbose elements that mirror human problem-solving, categorized as progressive reasoning (the essential solution development path) and functional elements (verification processes, alternative solution approaches, and error corrections). While progressive reasoning is crucial, the functional elements significantly increase computational demands during test-time inference. We introduce PIR (Perplexity-based Importance Refinement), a principled framework that quantitatively evaluates the importance of each reasoning step based on its impact on answer prediction confidence. PIR systematically identifies and selectively prunes only low-importance functional steps while preserving progressive reasoning components, creating optimized training data that maintains the integrity of the core solution path while reducing verbosity. Models fine-tuned on PIR-optimized data exhibit superior test-time scaling properties, generating more concise reasoning chains while achieving improved accuracy (+0.9\% to +6.6\%) with significantly reduced token usage (-3\% to -41\%) across challenging reasoning benchmarks (AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond). Our approach demonstrates strong generalizability across different model sizes, data sources, and token budgets, offering a practical solution for deploying reasoning-capable LLMs in scenarios where efficient test-time scaling, response time, and computational efficiency are valuable constraints.

  While AI agents hold transformative potential in business, effective performance benchmarking is hindered by the scarcity of public, realistic business data on widely used platforms. Existing benchmarks often lack fidelity in their environments, data, and agent-user interactions, with limited coverage of diverse business scenarios and industries. To address these gaps, we introduce CRMArena-Pro, a novel benchmark for holistic, realistic assessment of LLM agents in diverse professional settings. CRMArena-Pro expands on CRMArena with nineteen expert-validated tasks across sales, service, and 'configure, price, and quote' processes, for both Business-to-Business and Business-to-Customer scenarios. It distinctively incorporates multi-turn interactions guided by diverse personas and robust confidentiality awareness assessments. Experiments reveal leading LLM agents achieve only around 58% single-turn success on CRMArena-Pro, with performance dropping significantly to approximately 35% in multi-turn settings. While Workflow Execution proves more tractable for top agents (over 83% single-turn success), other evaluated business skills present greater challenges. Furthermore, agents exhibit near-zero inherent confidentiality awareness; though targeted prompting can improve this, it often compromises task performance. These findings highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and enterprise demands, underscoring the need for advancements in multi-turn reasoning, confidentiality adherence, and versatile skill acquisition.

  Human-generated reward signals are critical for aligning generative models with human preferences, guiding both training and inference-time evaluations. While large language models (LLMs) employed as proxy evaluators, i.e., LLM-as-a-Judge, significantly reduce the costs associated with manual annotations, they typically require extensive modality-specific training data and fail to generalize well across diverse multimodal tasks. In this paper, we propose Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages minimal textual reasoning data to robustly generalize across multiple modalities and evaluation formats. Our core intuition is that structured textual reasoning explanations inherently encode generalizable decision-making patterns, enabling an effective transfer to multimodal judgments, e.g., with images or videos. Empirical results demonstrate that Flex-Judge, despite being trained on significantly fewer text data, achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively trained multimodal evaluators. Notably, Flex-Judge presents broad impact in modalities like molecule, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce, underscoring its practical value in resource-constrained domains. Our framework highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a powerful, cost-effective alternative to traditional annotation-intensive approaches, substantially advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of misinformation in digital platforms reveals the limitations of traditional detection methods, which mostly rely on static classification and fail to capture the intricate process of real-world fact-checking. Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two fakenews datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards robust and interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be open-sourced in a future release.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Intent detection, a core component of natural language understanding, has considerably evolved as a crucial mechanism in safeguarding large language models (LLMs). While prior work has applied intent detection to enhance LLMs' moderation guardrails, showing a significant success against content-level jailbreaks, the robustness of these intent-aware guardrails under malicious manipulations remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of intent-aware guardrails and demonstrate that LLMs exhibit implicit intent detection capabilities. We propose a two-stage intent-based prompt-refinement framework, IntentPrompt, that first transforms harmful inquiries into structured outlines and further reframes them into declarative-style narratives by iteratively optimizing prompts via feedback loops to enhance jailbreak success for red-teaming purposes. Extensive experiments across four public benchmarks and various black-box LLMs indicate that our framework consistently outperforms several cutting-edge jailbreak methods and evades even advanced Intent Analysis (IA) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based defenses. Specifically, our "FSTR+SPIN" variant achieves attack success rates ranging from 88.25% to 96.54% against CoT-based defenses on the o1 model, and from 86.75% to 97.12% on the GPT-4o model under IA-based defenses. These findings highlight a critical weakness in LLMs' safety mechanisms and suggest that intent manipulation poses a growing challenge to content moderation guardrails.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 exhibit strong complex problems solving abilities by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning steps. It is challenging to directly train small language models (SLMs) to emerge long CoT. Thus, distillation becomes a practical method to enable SLMs for such reasoning ability. However, the long CoT often contains a lot of redundant contents (e.g., overthinking steps) which may make SLMs hard to learn considering their relatively poor capacity and generalization. To address this issue, we propose a simple-yet-effective method to prune unnecessary steps in long CoT, and then employ an on-policy method for the SLM itself to curate valid and useful long CoT training data. In this way, SLMs can effectively learn efficient long CoT reasoning and preserve competitive performance at the same time. Experimental results across a series of mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in distilling long CoT reasoning ability into SLMs which maintains the competitive performance but significantly reduces generating redundant reasoning steps.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise as data analysis agents, but existing benchmarks overlook the iterative nature of the field, where experts' decisions evolve with deeper insights of the dataset. To address this, we introduce IDA-Bench, a novel benchmark evaluating LLM agents in multi-round interactive scenarios. Derived from complex Kaggle notebooks, tasks are presented as sequential natural language instructions by an LLM-simulated user. Agent performance is judged by comparing its final numerical output to the human-derived baseline. Initial results show that even state-of-the-art coding agents (like Claude-3.7-thinking) succeed on < 50% of the tasks, highlighting limitations not evident in single-turn tests. This work underscores the need to improve LLMs' multi-round capabilities for building more reliable data analysis agents, highlighting the necessity of achieving a balance between instruction following and reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advancements, are fundamentally limited by their static parametric knowledge, hindering performance on tasks requiring open-domain up-to-date information. While enabling LLMs to interact with external knowledge environments is a promising solution, current efforts primarily address closed-end problems. Open-ended questions, which characterized by lacking a standard answer or providing non-unique and diverse answers, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present O$^2$-Searcher, a novel search agent leveraging reinforcement learning to effectively tackle both open-ended and closed-ended questions in the open domain. O$^2$-Searcher leverages an efficient, locally simulated search environment for dynamic knowledge acquisition, effectively decoupling the external world knowledge from model's sophisticated reasoning processes. It employs a unified training mechanism with meticulously designed reward functions, enabling the agent to identify problem types and adapt different answer generation strategies. Furthermore, to evaluate performance on complex open-ended tasks, we construct O$^2$-QA, a high-quality benchmark featuring 300 manually curated, multi-domain open-ended questions with associated web page caches. Extensive experiments show that O$^2$-Searcher, using only a 3B model, significantly surpasses leading LLM agents on O$^2$-QA. It also achieves SOTA results on various closed-ended QA benchmarks against similarly-sized models, while performing on par with much larger ones.

  Modern BPE tokenizers often split calendar dates into meaningless fragments, e.g., 20250312 $\rightarrow$ 202, 503, 12, inflating token counts and obscuring the inherent structure needed for robust temporal reasoning. In this work, we (1) introduce a simple yet interpretable metric, termed date fragmentation ratio, that measures how faithfully a tokenizer preserves multi-digit date components; (2) release DateAugBench, a suite of 6500 examples spanning three temporal reasoning tasks: context-based date resolution, format-invariance puzzles, and date arithmetic across historical, contemporary, and future time periods; and (3) through layer-wise probing and causal attention-hop analyses, uncover an emergent date-abstraction mechanism whereby large language models stitch together the fragments of month, day, and year components for temporal reasoning. Our experiments show that excessive fragmentation correlates with accuracy drops of up to 10 points on uncommon dates like historical and futuristic dates. Further, we find that the larger the model, the faster the emergent date abstraction that heals date fragments is accomplished. Lastly, we observe a reasoning path that LLMs follow to assemble date fragments, typically differing from human interpretation (year $\rightarrow$ month $\rightarrow$ day). Our datasets and code are made publicly available \href{this https URL}{here}.

  Large reasoning models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable performance in the domain of reasoning. A key component of their training is the incorporation of verifiable rewards within reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing reward benchmarks do not evaluate reference-based reward systems, leaving researchers with limited understanding of the accuracy of verifiers used in RL. In this paper, we introduce two benchmarks, VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, designed to assess the performance of reference-based reward systems. These benchmarks are constructed through meticulous data collection and curation, followed by careful human annotation to ensure high quality. Current models still show considerable room for improvement on both VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, especially smaller-scale models. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough and comprehensive analysis of evaluation results, offering insights for understanding and developing reference-based reward systems. Our proposed benchmarks serve as effective tools for guiding the development of verifier accuracy and the reasoning capabilities of models trained via RL in reasoning tasks.

  When addressing complex questions that require new information, people often associate the question with existing knowledge to derive a sensible answer. For instance, when evaluating whether melatonin aids insomnia, one might associate "hormones helping mental disorders" with "melatonin being a hormone and insomnia a mental disorder" to complete the reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) also require such associative thinking, particularly in resolving scientific inquiries when retrieved knowledge is insufficient and does not directly answer the question. Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE) addresses this by using a knowledge graph (KG) to extrapolate structured knowledge. However, it involves the construction and pruning of many hypothetical triplets, which limits efficiency and generalizability. We propose Self-GIVE, a retrieve-RL framework that enhances LLMs with automatic associative thinking through reinforcement learning. Self-GIVE extracts structured information and entity sets to assist the model in linking to the queried concepts. We address GIVE's key limitations: (1) extensive LLM calls and token overhead for knowledge extrapolation, (2) difficulty in deploying on smaller LLMs (3B or 7B) due to complex instructions, and (3) inaccurate knowledge from LLM pruning. Specifically, after fine-tuning using self-GIVE with a 135 node UMLS KG, it improves the performance of the Qwen2.5 3B and 7B models by up to $\textbf{28.5%$\rightarrow$71.4%}$ and $\textbf{78.6$\rightarrow$90.5%}$ in samples $\textbf{unseen}$ in challenging biomedical QA tasks. In particular, Self-GIVE allows the 7B model to match or outperform GPT3.5 turbo with GIVE, while cutting token usage by over 90\%. Self-GIVE enhances the scalable integration of structured retrieval and reasoning with associative thinking.

  Instruction-following is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user intent. While recent reasoning-oriented models exhibit impressive performance on complex mathematical problems, their ability to adhere to natural language instructions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MathIF, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating instruction-following in mathematical reasoning tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals a consistent tension between scaling up reasoning capacity and maintaining controllability, as models that reason more effectively often struggle to comply with user directives. We find that models tuned on distilled long chains-of-thought or trained with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning often degrade in instruction adherence, especially when generation length increases. Furthermore, we show that even simple interventions can partially recover obedience, though at the cost of reasoning performance. These findings highlight a fundamental tension in current LLM training paradigms and motivate the need for more instruction-aware reasoning models. We release the code and data atthis https URL.

  The emergence of groundbreaking large language models capable of performing complex reasoning tasks holds significant promise for addressing various scientific challenges, including those arising in complex clinical scenarios. To enable their safe and effective deployment in real-world healthcare settings, it is urgently necessary to benchmark the diagnostic capabilities of current models systematically. Given the limitations of existing medical benchmarks in evaluating advanced diagnostic reasoning, we present DiagnosisArena, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark designed to rigorously assess professional-level diagnostic competence. DiagnosisArena consists of 1,113 pairs of segmented patient cases and corresponding diagnoses, spanning 28 medical specialties, deriving from clinical case reports published in 10 top-tier medical journals. The benchmark is developed through a meticulous construction pipeline, involving multiple rounds of screening and review by both AI systems and human experts, with thorough checks conducted to prevent data leakage. Our study reveals that even the most advanced reasoning models, o3-mini, o1, and DeepSeek-R1, achieve only 45.82%, 31.09%, and 17.79% accuracy, respectively. This finding highlights a significant generalization bottleneck in current large language models when faced with clinical diagnostic reasoning challenges. Through DiagnosisArena, we aim to drive further advancements in AIs diagnostic reasoning capabilities, enabling more effective solutions for real-world clinical diagnostic challenges.

  We present PersonaConvBench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating personalized reasoning and generation in multi-turn conversations with large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing work that focuses on either personalization or conversational structure in isolation, PersonaConvBench integrates both, offering three core tasks: sentence classification, impact regression, and user-centric text generation across ten diverse Reddit-based domains. This design enables systematic analysis of how personalized conversational context shapes LLM outputs in realistic multi-user scenarios. We benchmark several commercial and open-source LLMs under a unified prompting setup and observe that incorporating personalized history yields substantial performance improvements, including a 198 percent relative gain over the best non-conversational baseline in sentiment classification. By releasing PersonaConvBench with evaluations and code, we aim to support research on LLMs that adapt to individual styles, track long-term context, and produce contextually rich, engaging responses.

  Compressing long chain-of-thought (CoT) from large language models (LLMs) is an emerging strategy to improve the reasoning efficiency of LLMs. Despite its promising benefits, existing studies equally compress all thoughts within a long CoT, hindering more concise and effective reasoning. To this end, we first investigate the importance of different thoughts by examining their effectiveness and efficiency in contributing to reasoning through automatic long CoT chunking and Monte Carlo rollouts. Building upon the insights, we propose a theoretically bounded metric to jointly measure the effectiveness and efficiency of different thoughts. We then propose Long$\otimes$Short, an efficient reasoning framework that enables two LLMs to collaboratively solve the problem: a long-thought LLM for more effectively generating important thoughts, while a short-thought LLM for efficiently generating remaining thoughts. Specifically, we begin by synthesizing a small amount of cold-start data to fine-tune LLMs for long-thought and short-thought reasoning styles, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a synergizing-oriented multi-turn reinforcement learning, focusing on the model self-evolution and collaboration between long-thought and short-thought LLMs. Experimental results show that our method enables Qwen2.5-7B and Llama3.1-8B to achieve comparable performance compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, while reducing token length by over 80% across the MATH500, AIME24/25, AMC23, and GPQA Diamond benchmarks.

  Tree-search-based reasoning methods have significantly enhanced the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by facilitating the exploration of multiple intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., thoughts. However, these methods suffer from substantial inference latency, as they have to generate numerous reasoning thoughts, severely limiting LLM applicability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Speculative Search (SpecSearch) framework that significantly accelerates LLM reasoning by optimizing thought generation. Specifically, SpecSearch utilizes a small model to strategically collaborate with a large model at both thought and token levels, efficiently generating high-quality reasoning thoughts. The major pillar of SpecSearch is a novel quality-preserving rejection mechanism, which effectively filters out thoughts whose quality falls below that of the large model's outputs. Moreover, we show that SpecSearch preserves comparable reasoning quality to the large model. Experiments on both the Qwen and Llama models demonstrate that SpecSearch significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 2.12$\times$ speedup with comparable reasoning quality.

  Large language models (LLMs) are foundational explorations to artificial general intelligence, yet their alignment with human values via instruction tuning and preference learning achieves only superficial compliance. Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.

  Advanced table question answering (TableQA) methods prompt large language models (LLMs) to generate answer text, SQL query, Python code, or custom operations, which impressively improve the complex reasoning problems in the TableQA task. However, these methods lack the versatility to cope with specific question types or table structures. In contrast, the Spreadsheet Formula, the widely used and well-defined operation language for tabular data, has not been thoroughly explored to solve TableQA. In this paper, we first attempt to use the Formula as the executable representation for solving complex reasoning on tables with different structures. Specifically, we construct \texttt{FromulaQA}, a large Formula-annotated TableQA dataset from existing datasets. In addition, we propose \texttt{TabAF}, a general table answering framework to solve multiple types of tasks over multiple types of tables simultaneously. Unlike existing methods, \texttt{TabAF} decodes answers and Formulas with a single LLM backbone, demonstrating great versatility and generalization. \texttt{TabAF} based on Llama3.1-70B achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the WikiTableQuestion, HiTab, and TabFact.

  Advanced reasoning in large language models has achieved remarkable performance on challenging tasks, but the prevailing long-context reasoning paradigm faces critical limitations: quadratic computational scaling with sequence length, reasoning constrained by maximum context boundaries, and performance degradation beyond pre-training context windows. Existing approaches primarily compress reasoning chains without addressing the fundamental scaling problem. To overcome these challenges, we introduce InftyThink, a paradigm that transforms monolithic reasoning into an iterative process with intermediate summarization. By interleaving short reasoning segments with concise progress summaries, our approach enables unbounded reasoning depth while maintaining bounded computational costs. This creates a characteristic sawtooth memory pattern that significantly reduces computational complexity compared to traditional approaches. Furthermore, we develop a methodology for reconstructing long-context reasoning datasets into our iterative format, transforming OpenR1-Math into 333K training instances. Experiments across multiple model architectures demonstrate that our approach reduces computational costs while improving performance, with Qwen2.5-Math-7B showing 3-13% improvements across MATH500, AIME24, and GPQA_diamond benchmarks. Our work challenges the assumed trade-off between reasoning depth and computational efficiency, providing a more scalable approach to complex reasoning without architectural modifications.

  The expanding knowledge and memorisation capacity of frontier language models allows them to solve many reasoning tasks directly by exploiting prior knowledge, leading to inflated estimates of their reasoning abilities. We introduce LINGOLY-TOO, a challenging reasoning benchmark grounded in natural language and designed to counteract the effect of non-reasoning abilities on reasoning estimates. Using linguistically informed rulesets, we permute reasoning problems written in real languages to generate numerous question variations. These permutations preserve the intrinsic reasoning steps required for each solution while reducing the likelihood problems are directly solvable with models' knowledge. Experiments and analyses show that models can circumvent reasoning and answer from prior knowledge. On a metric that rewards consistent reasoning, all models perform poorly and exhibit high variance across question permutations, indicating that Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning faculty remains brittle. Overall, results on the benchmark reflect the recent progress of Inference-Time Compute (ITC) models but suggest ample room for further improvement. The benchmark is a step towards better measurement of reasoning abilities of LLMs and offers a cautionary tale on the importance of disentangling reasoning abilities from models' internalised knowledge when developing reasoning benchmarks.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automatic generation of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, leading to strong performance on tasks such as math and code. However, when reasoning steps reflect social stereotypes (e.g., those related to gender, race or age), they can reinforce harmful associations and lead to misleading conclusions. We present the first systematic evaluation of social bias within LLM-generated reasoning, using the BBQ dataset to analyze both prediction accuracy and bias. Our study spans a wide range of mainstream reasoning models, including instruction-tuned and CoT-augmented variants of DeepSeek-R1 (8B/32B), ChatGPT, and other open-source LLMs. We quantify how biased reasoning steps correlate with incorrect predictions and often lead to stereotype expression. To mitigate reasoning-induced bias, we propose Answer Distribution as Bias Proxy (ADBP), a lightweight mitigation method that detects bias by tracking how model predictions change across incremental reasoning steps. ADBP outperforms a stereotype-free baseline in most cases, mitigating bias and improving the accuracy of LLM outputs. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been proven effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recent advancements, such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, suggest that scaling up the length of CoT sequences during inference could further boost LLM reasoning performance. However, due to the autoregressive nature of LLM decoding, longer CoT outputs lead to a linear increase in inference latency, adversely affecting user experience, particularly when the CoT exceeds 10,000 tokens. To address this limitation, we analyze the semantic importance of tokens within CoT outputs and reveal that their contributions to reasoning vary. Building on this insight, we propose TokenSkip, a simple yet effective approach that enables LLMs to selectively skip less important tokens, allowing for controllable CoT compression. Extensive experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSkip in reducing CoT token usage while preserving strong reasoning performance. Notably, when applied to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, TokenSkip reduces reasoning tokens by 40% (from 313 to 181) on GSM8K, with less than a 0.4% performance drop.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks, particularly in mathematics. However, the domain of physics reasoning presents unique challenges that have received significantly less attention. Existing benchmarks often fall short in evaluating LLMs' abilities on the breadth and depth of undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for a comprehensive evaluation. To fill this gap, we introduce UGPhysics, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate UnderGraduate-level Physics (UGPhysics) reasoning with LLMs. UGPhysics includes 5,520 undergraduate-level physics problems in both English and Chinese, covering 13 subjects with seven different answer types and four distinct physics reasoning skills, all rigorously screened for data leakage. Additionally, we develop a Model-Assistant Rule-based Judgment (MARJ) pipeline specifically tailored for assessing answer correctness of physics problems, ensuring accurate evaluation. Our evaluation of 31 leading LLMs shows that the highest overall accuracy, 49.8% (achieved by OpenAI-o1-mini), emphasizes the necessity for models with stronger physics reasoning skills, beyond math abilities. We hope UGPhysics, along with MARJ, will drive future advancements in AI for physics reasoning. Codes and data are available atthis https URL.

  Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as an effective approach for activating latent capabilities in LLMs. Interestingly, we observe that both CoT reasoning and self-training share the core objective: iteratively leveraging model-generated information to progressively reduce prediction uncertainty. Building on this insight, we propose a novel CoT framework to improve reasoning performance. Our framework integrates two key components: (i) a task-specific prompt module that optimizes the initial reasoning process, and (ii) an adaptive reasoning iteration module that dynamically refines the reasoning process and addresses the limitations of previous CoT approaches, \ie over-reasoning and high similarity between consecutive reasoning iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant advantages in both performance and computational efficiency.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in reasoning tasks but face limitations in mathematical and complex logical reasoning. Existing methods to improve LLMs' logical capabilities either involve traceable or verifiable logical sequences that generate more reliable responses by constructing logical structures yet increase computational costs, or introduces rigid logic template rules, reducing flexibility. In this paper, we propose Reversal of Thought (RoT), a plug-and-play and cost-effective reasoning framework designed to enhance the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs during the warm-up phase prior to batch inference. RoT utilizes a Preference-Guided Reverse Reasoning warm-up strategy, which integrates logical symbols for pseudocode planning through meta-cognitive mechanisms and pairwise preference self-evaluation to generate task-specific prompts solely through demonstrations, aligning with LLMs' cognitive preferences shaped by RLHF. Through reverse reasoning, we utilize a Cognitive Preference Manager to assess knowledge boundaries and further expand LLMs' reasoning capabilities by aggregating solution logic for known tasks and stylistic templates for unknown tasks. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate that RoT surpasses existing baselines in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency.

  Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) represent a classic paradigm where models enhance generative capabilities using external knowledge retrieved via a specialized module. Recent advancements in Agent techniques enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously utilize tools for retrieval, planning, and reasoning. While existing training-based methods show promise, their agentic abilities are limited by inherent characteristics of the task-specific data used during training. To further enhance the universal search capability of agents, we propose a novel pre-training framework, MASKSEARCH. In the pre-training stage, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Mask Prediction (RAMP) task, where the model learns to leverage search tools to fill masked spans on a large number of pre-training data, thus acquiring universal retrieval and reasoning capabilities for LLMs. After that, the model is trained on downstream tasks to achieve further improvement. We apply both Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for training. For SFT, we combine agent-based and distillation-based methods to generate training data, starting with a multi-agent system consisting of a planner, rewriter, observer, and followed by a self-evolving teacher model. While for RL, we employ DAPO as the training framework and adopt a hybrid reward system consisting of answer rewards and format rewards. Additionally, we introduce a curriculum learning approach that allows the model to learn progressively from easier to more challenging instances based on the number of masked spans. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework in the scenario of open-domain multi-hop question answering. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MASKSEARCH significantly enhances the performance of LLM-based search agents on both in-domain and out-of-domain downstream tasks.

  Limited access to mental healthcare, extended wait times, and increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led individuals to turn to LLMs for fulfilling their mental health needs. However, examining the multi-turn mental health conversation capabilities of LLMs remains under-explored. Existing evaluation frameworks typically focus on diagnostic accuracy and win-rates and often overlook alignment with patient-specific goals, values, and personalities required for meaningful conversations. To address this, we introduce MedAgent, a novel framework for synthetically generating realistic, multi-turn mental health sensemaking conversations and use it to create the Mental Health Sensemaking Dialogue (MHSD) dataset, comprising over 2,200 patient-LLM conversations. Additionally, we present MultiSenseEval, a holistic framework to evaluate the multi-turn conversation abilities of LLMs in healthcare settings using human-centric criteria. Our findings reveal that frontier reasoning models yield below-par performance for patient-centric communication and struggle at advanced diagnostic capabilities with average score of 31%. Additionally, we observed variation in model performance based on patient's persona and performance drop with increasing turns in the conversation. Our work provides a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework, a dataset and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in multi-turn mental health conversations.

  Images usually convey richer detail than text, but often include redundant information which potentially downgrades multimodal reasoning performance. When faced with lengthy or complex messages, humans tend to employ abstract thinking to convert them into simple and concise abstracts. Inspired by this cognitive strategy, we introduce Visual Abstract Thinking (VAT), a novel thinking paradigm that prompts Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with visual abstract instead of explicit verbal thoughts or elaborate guidance, permitting a more concentrated visual reasoning mechanism. Explicit thinking, such as Chain-of-thought (CoT) or tool-augmented approaches, increases the complexity of reasoning process via inserting verbose intermediate steps, external knowledge or visual information. In contrast, VAT reduces redundant visual information and encourages models to focus their reasoning on more essential visual elements. Experimental results show that VAT consistently empowers different models, and achieves an average gain of 17% over GPT-4o baseline by employing diverse types of visual abstracts, demonstrating that VAT can enhance visual reasoning abilities for MLLMs regarding conceptual, structural and relational reasoning tasks. VAT is also compatible with CoT in knowledge-intensive multimodal reasoning tasks. These findings highlight the effectiveness of visual reasoning via abstract thinking and encourage further exploration of more diverse reasoning paradigms from the perspective of human cognition.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have been widely integrated into information retrieval to advance traditional techniques. However, effectively enabling LLMs to seek accurate knowledge in complex tasks remains a challenge due to the complexity of multi-hop queries as well as the irrelevant retrieved content. To address these limitations, we propose EXSEARCH, an agentic search framework, where the LLM learns to retrieve useful information as the reasoning unfolds through a self-incentivized process. At each step, the LLM decides what to retrieve (thinking), triggers an external retriever (search), and extracts fine-grained evidence (recording) to support next-step reasoning. To enable LLM with this capability, EXSEARCH adopts a Generalized Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In the E-step, the LLM generates multiple search trajectories and assigns an importance weight to each; the M-step trains the LLM on them with a re-weighted loss function. This creates a self-incentivized loop, where the LLM iteratively learns from its own generated data, progressively improving itself for search. We further theoretically analyze this training process, establishing convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that EXSEARCH substantially outperforms baselines, e.g., +7.8% improvement on exact match score. Motivated by these promising results, we introduce EXSEARCH-Zoo, an extension that extends our method to broader scenarios, to facilitate future work.

However, the extensive reasoning steps involved can significantly increase computational costs, posing challenges for real-world deployment. Recent efforts have focused on optimizing reasoning efficiency by shortening the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning processes through various approaches, such as length-aware prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning on CoT data with variable lengths, and reinforcement learning with length penalties.

  The detection of mental health problems from social media and the interpretation of these results have been extensively explored. Research has shown that incorporating clinical symptom information into a model enhances domain expertise, improving its detection and interpretation performance. While large language models (LLMs) are shown to be effective for generating explanatory rationales in mental health detection, their substantially large parameter size and high computational cost limit their practicality. Reasoning distillation transfers this ability to smaller language models (SLMs), but inconsistencies in the relevance and domain alignment of LLM-generated rationales pose a challenge. This paper investigates how rationale quality impacts SLM performance in mental health detection and explanation generation. We hypothesize that ensuring high-quality and domain-relevant rationales enhances the distillation. To this end, we propose a framework that selects rationales based on their alignment with expert clinical reasoning. Experiments show that our quality-focused approach significantly enhances SLM performance in both mental disorder detection and rationale generation. This work highlights the importance of rationale quality and offers an insightful framework for knowledge transfer in mental health applications.

We conduct experiments in the agent self-improving benchmark, OpenWebVoyager, and demonstrate that distilling salient reasoning patterns into the backbone LLM via simple fine-tuning can substantially enhance its performance.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in general-purpose machine translation, but their effectiveness in complex, domain-sensitive translation tasks remains underexplored. Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), raise the question of whether structured reasoning can enhance translation quality across diverse domains. In this work, we compare the performance of LRMs with traditional LLMs across 15 representative domains and four translation directions. Our evaluation considers various factors, including task difficulty, input length, and terminology density. We use a combination of automatic metrics and an enhanced MQM-based evaluation hierarchy to assess translation quality. Our findings show that LRMs consistently outperform traditional LLMs in semantically complex domains, especially in long-text and high-difficulty translation scenarios. Moreover, domain-adaptive prompting strategies further improve performance by better leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LRMs. These results highlight the potential of structured reasoning in MDMT tasks and provide valuable insights for optimizing translation systems in domain-sensitive contexts.

  Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly improved long-chain reasoning capabilities over Large Language Models (LLMs). However, LRMs often produce unnecessarily lengthy outputs even for simple queries, leading to inefficiencies or even accuracy degradation compared to LLMs. To overcome this, we propose CP-Router, a training-free and model-agnostic routing framework that dynamically selects between an LLM and an LRM, demonstrated with multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) prompts. The routing decision is guided by the prediction uncertainty estimates derived via Conformal Prediction (CP), which provides rigorous coverage guarantees. To further refine the uncertainty differentiation across inputs, we introduce Full and Binary Entropy (FBE), a novel entropy-based criterion that adaptively selects the appropriate CP threshold. Experiments across diverse MCQA benchmarks, including mathematics, logical reasoning, and Chinese chemistry, demonstrate that CP-Router efficiently reduces token usage while maintaining or even improving accuracy compared to using LRM alone. We also extend CP-Router to diverse model pairings and open-ended QA, where it continues to demonstrate strong performance, validating its generality and robustness.

  Researchers working on low-resource languages face persistent challenges due to limited data availability and restricted access to computational resources. Although most large language models (LLMs) are predominantly trained in high-resource languages, adapting them to low-resource contexts, particularly African languages, requires specialized techniques. Several strategies have emerged for adapting models to low-resource languages in todays LLM landscape, defined by multi-stage pre-training and post-training paradigms. However, the most effective approaches remain uncertain. This work systematically investigates which adaptation strategies yield the best performance when extending existing LLMs to African languages. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies to evaluate different combinations of data types (translated versus synthetically generated), training stages (pre-training versus post-training), and other model adaptation configurations. Our experiments focuses on mathematical reasoning tasks, using the Llama 3.1 model family as our base model.

  Nowadays, regulatory compliance has become a cornerstone of corporate governance, ensuring adherence to systematic legal frameworks. At its core, financial regulations often comprise highly intricate provisions, layered logical structures, and numerous exceptions, which inevitably result in labor-intensive or comprehension challenges. To mitigate this, recent Regulatory Technology (RegTech) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in automating the conversion of regulatory text into executable compliance logic. However, their performance remains suboptimal particularly when applied to Chinese-language financial regulations, due to three key limitations: (1) incomplete domain-specific knowledge representation, (2) insufficient hierarchical reasoning capabilities, and (3) failure to maintain temporal and logical coherence. One promising solution is to develop a domain specific and code-oriented datasets for model training. Existing datasets such as LexGLUE, LegalBench, and CODE-ACCORD are often English-focused, domain-mismatched, or lack fine-grained granularity for compliance code generation. To fill these gaps, we present Compliance-to-Code, the first large-scale Chinese dataset dedicated to financial regulatory compliance. Covering 1,159 annotated clauses from 361 regulations across ten categories, each clause is modularly structured with four logical elements-subject, condition, constraint, and contextual information-along with regulation relations. We provide deterministic Python code mappings, detailed code reasoning, and code explanations to facilitate automated auditing. To demonstrate utility, we present FinCheck: a pipeline for regulation structuring, code generation, and report generation.

  As the impact of large language models increases, understanding the moral values they reflect becomes ever more important. Assessing the nature of moral values as understood by these models via direct prompting is challenging due to potential leakage of human norms into model training data, and their sensitivity to prompt formulation. Instead, we propose to use word associations, which have been shown to reflect moral reasoning in humans, as low-level underlying representations to obtain a more robust picture of LLMs' moral reasoning. We study moral differences in associations from western English-speaking communities and LLMs trained predominantly on English data. First, we create a large dataset of LLM-generated word associations, resembling an existing data set of human word associations. Next, we propose a novel method to propagate moral values based on seed words derived from Moral Foundation Theory through the human and LLM-generated association graphs. Finally, we compare the resulting moral conceptualizations, highlighting detailed but systematic differences between moral values emerging from English speakers and LLM associations.

  Long chain-of-thought (CoT) significantly enhances large language models' (LLM) reasoning capabilities. However, the extensive reasoning traces lead to inefficiencies and an increased time-to-first-token (TTFT). We propose a novel training paradigm that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to guide reasoning LLMs to interleave thinking and answering for multi-hop questions. We observe that models inherently possess the ability to perform interleaved reasoning, which can be further enhanced through RL. We introduce a simple yet effective rule-based reward to incentivize correct intermediate steps, which guides the policy model toward correct reasoning paths by leveraging intermediate signals generated during interleaved reasoning. Extensive experiments conducted across five diverse datasets and three RL algorithms (PPO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++) demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional think-answer reasoning, without requiring external tools. Specifically, our approach reduces TTFT by over 80% on average and improves up to 19.3% in Pass@1 accuracy. Furthermore, our method, trained solely on question answering and logical reasoning datasets, exhibits strong generalization ability to complex reasoning datasets such as MATH, GPQA, and MMLU. Additionally, we conduct in-depth analysis to reveal several valuable insights into conditional reward modeling.

  Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference. However, existing research has overlooked the efficiency of TTS from a latency-sensitive perspective. Through a latency-aware evaluation of representative TTS methods, we demonstrate that a compute-optimal TTS does not always result in the lowest latency in scenarios where latency is critical. To address this gap and achieve latency-optimal TTS, we propose two key approaches by optimizing the concurrency configurations: (1) branch-wise parallelism, which leverages multiple concurrent inference branches, and (2) sequence-wise parallelism, enabled by speculative decoding. By integrating these two approaches and allocating computational resources properly to each, our latency-optimal TTS enables a 32B model to reach 82.3% accuracy on MATH-500 within 1 minute and a smaller 3B model to achieve 72.4% within 10 seconds. Our work emphasizes the importance of latency-aware TTS and demonstrates its ability to deliver both speed and accuracy in latency-sensitive scenarios.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the field of biomedical question answering, but their application in real-world clinical consultations still faces core challenges. Existing systems rely on a one-way information transmission mode where patients must fully describe their symptoms in a single round, leading to nonspecific diagnostic recommendations when complaints are vague. Traditional multi-turn dialogue methods based on supervised learning are constrained by static data-driven paradigms, lacking generalizability and struggling to intelligently extract key clinical information. To address these limitations, we propose DoctorAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent collaborative framework that models medical consultations as a dynamic decision-making process under uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously optimizes its questioning strategy within the RL framework through multi-turn interactions with the patient agent, dynamically adjusting its information-gathering path based on comprehensive rewards from the Consultation Evaluator. This RL fine-tuning mechanism enables LLMs to autonomously develop interaction strategies aligned with clinical reasoning logic, rather than superficially imitating patterns in existing dialogue data. Notably, we constructed MTMedDialog, the first English multi-turn medical consultation dataset capable of simulating patient interactions. Experiments demonstrate that DoctorAgent-RL outperforms existing models in both multi-turn reasoning capability and final diagnostic performance, demonstrating practical value in assisting clinical consultations.this https URL

To this end, recent works have leveraged scene graphs, a structured representation that encodes entities, attributes, and their relationships in a scene. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' ability to utilize scene graphs remains limited. In this work, we introduce Text-Scene Graph (TSG) Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs' ability to (1) understand scene graphs and (2) generate them from textual narratives. With TSG Bench we evaluate 11 LLMs and reveal that, while models perform well on scene graph understanding, they struggle with scene graph generation, particularly for complex narratives. Our analysis indicates that these models fail to effectively decompose discrete scenes from a complex narrative, leading to a bottleneck when generating scene graphs. These findings underscore the need for improved methodologies in scene graph generation and provide valuable insights for future research. The demonstration of our benchmark is available atthis https URL. Additionally, our code and evaluation data are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they often exhibit a specific cultural biases, neglecting the values and linguistic diversity of low-resource regions. This cultural bias not only undermines universal equality, but also risks reinforcing stereotypes and perpetuating discrimination. To address this, we propose CulFiT, a novel culturally-aware training paradigm that leverages multilingual data and fine-grained reward modeling to enhance cultural sensitivity and inclusivity. Our approach synthesizes diverse cultural-related questions, constructs critique data in culturally relevant languages, and employs fine-grained rewards to decompose cultural texts into verifiable knowledge units for interpretable evaluation. We also introduce GlobalCultureQA, a multilingual open-ended question-answering dataset designed to evaluate culturally-aware responses in a global context. Extensive experiments on three existing benchmarks and our GlobalCultureQA demonstrate that CulFiT achieves state-of-the-art open-source model performance in cultural alignment and general reasoning.

  Learning to adapt pretrained language models to unlabeled, out-of-distribution data is a critical challenge, as models often falter on structurally novel reasoning tasks even while excelling within their training distribution. We introduce a new framework called VDS-TTT - Verifier-Driven Sample Selection for Test-Time Training to efficiently address this. We use a learned verifier to score a pool of generated responses and select only from high ranking pseudo-labeled examples for fine-tuned adaptation. Specifically, for each input query our LLM generates N candidate answers; the verifier assigns a reliability score to each, and the response with the highest confidence and above a fixed threshold is paired with its query for test-time training. We fine-tune only low-rank LoRA adapter parameters, ensuring adaptation efficiency and fast convergence. Our proposed self-supervised framework is the first to synthesize verifier driven test-time training data for continuous self-improvement of the model. Experiments across three diverse benchmarks and three state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that VDS-TTT yields up to a 32.29% relative improvement over the base model and a 6.66% gain compared to verifier-based methods without test-time training, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency for on-the-fly large language model adaptation.

  Large Language Models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, with Reinforcement Learning playing a key role in adapting them to specific applications. However, obtaining ground truth answers for training LLMs in mathematical problem-solving is often challenging, costly, and sometimes unfeasible. This research delves into the utilization of format and length as surrogate signals to train LLMs for mathematical problem-solving, bypassing the need for traditional ground truththis http URLstudy shows that a reward function centered on format correctness alone can yield performance improvements comparable to the standard GRPO algorithm in early phases. Recognizing the limitations of format-only rewards in the later phases, we incorporate length-based rewards. The resulting GRPO approach, leveraging format-length surrogate signals, not only matches but surpasses the performance of the standard GRPO algorithm relying on ground truth answers in certain scenarios, achieving 40.0\% accuracy on AIME2024 with a 7B base model. Through systematic exploration and experimentation, this research not only offers a practical solution for training LLMs to solve mathematical problems and reducing the dependence on extensive ground truth data collection, but also reveals the essence of why our label-free approach succeeds: base model is like an excellent student who has already mastered mathematical and logical reasoning skills, but performs poorly on the test paper, it simply needs to develop good answering habits to achieve outstanding results in exams , in other words, to unlock the capabilities it already possesses.

  The inherent capabilities of a language model (LM) and the reasoning strategies it employs jointly determine its performance in reasoning tasks. While test-time scaling is regarded as an effective approach to tackling complex reasoning tasks, it incurs substantial computational costs and often leads to "overthinking", where models become trapped in "thought pitfalls". To address this challenge, we propose Route-To-Reason (RTR), a novel unified routing framework that dynamically allocates both LMs and reasoning strategies according to task difficulty under budget constraints. RTR learns compressed representations of both expert models and reasoning strategies, enabling their joint and adaptive selection at inference time. This method is low-cost, highly flexible, and can be seamlessly extended to arbitrary black-box or white-box models and strategies, achieving true plug-and-play functionality. Extensive experiments across seven open source models and four reasoning strategies demonstrate that RTR achieves an optimal trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency among all baselines, achieving higher accuracy than the best single model while reducing token usage by over 60%.

  Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks, yet they remain prone to hallucinations when reasoning with insufficient internal knowledge. While integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) provides access to structured, verifiable information, existing approaches often generate incomplete or factually inconsistent reasoning paths. To this end, we propose Self-Reflective Planning (SRP), a framework that synergizes LLMs with KGs through iterative, reference-guided reasoning. Specifically, given a question and topic entities, SRP first searches for references to guide planning and reflection. In the planning process, it checks initial relations and generates a reasoning path. After retrieving knowledge from KGs through a reasoning path, it implements iterative reflection by judging the retrieval result and editing the reasoning path until the answer is correctly retrieved. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that SRP surpasses various strong baselines and further underscore its reliable reasoning ability.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate their impressive reasoning capabilities. However, the reasoning confined to internal parametric space limits LLMs' access to real-time information and understanding of the physical world. To overcome this constraint, we introduce SituatedThinker, a novel framework that enables LLMs to ground their reasoning in real-world contexts through situated thinking, which adaptively combines both internal knowledge and external information with predefined interfaces. By utilizing reinforcement learning, SituatedThinker incentivizes deliberate reasoning with the real world to acquire information and feedback, allowing LLMs to surpass their knowledge boundaries and enhance reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements on multi-hop question-answering and mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, SituatedThinker demonstrates strong performance on unseen tasks, such as KBQA, TableQA, and text-based games, showcasing the generalizable real-world grounded reasoning capability.

  Current large-language models (LLMs) typically adopt a fixed reasoning strategy, either simple or complex, for all questions, regardless of their difficulty. This neglect of variation in task and reasoning process complexity leads to an imbalance between performance and efficiency. Existing methods attempt to implement training-free fast-slow thinking system switching to handle problems of varying difficulty, but are limited by coarse-grained solution-level strategy adjustments. To address this issue, we propose a novel reasoning paradigm: Process-Level Adaptive Thinking Mode Switching (PATS), which enables LLMs to dynamically adjust their reasoning strategy based on the difficulty of each step, optimizing the balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Our approach integrates Process Reward Models (PRMs) with Beam Search, incorporating progressive mode switching and bad-step penalty mechanisms. Experiments on diverse mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our methodology achieves high accuracy while maintaining moderate token usage. This study emphasizes the significance of process-level, difficulty-aware reasoning strategy adaptation, offering valuable insights into efficient inference for LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning but often over-think, generating excessively long responses that hinder efficiency. We introduce DIET ( DIfficulty-AwarE Training), a framework that systematically cuts these "token calories" by integrating on-the-fly problem difficulty into the reinforcement learning (RL) process. DIET dynamically adapts token compression strategies by modulating token penalty strength and conditioning target lengths on estimated task difficulty, to optimize the performance-efficiency trade-off. We also theoretically analyze the pitfalls of naive reward weighting in group-normalized RL algorithms like GRPO, and propose Advantage Weighting technique, which enables stable and effective implementation of these difficulty-aware objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that DIET significantly reduces token counts while simultaneously improving reasoning performance. Beyond raw token reduction, we show two crucial benefits largely overlooked by prior work: (1) DIET leads to superior inference scaling. By maintaining high per-sample quality with fewer tokens, it enables better scaling performance via majority voting with more samples under fixed computational budgets, an area where other methods falter. (2) DIET enhances the natural positive correlation between response length and problem difficulty, ensuring verbosity is appropriately allocated, unlike many existing compression methods that disrupt this relationship. Our analyses provide a principled and effective framework for developing more efficient, practical, and high-performing LLMs.

  Inconsistent political statements represent a form of misinformation. They erode public trust and pose challenges to accountability, when left unnoticed. Detecting inconsistencies automatically could support journalists in asking clarification questions, thereby helping to keep politicians accountable. We propose the Inconsistency detection task and develop a scale of inconsistency types to prompt NLP-research in this direction. To provide a resource for detecting inconsistencies in a political domain, we present a dataset of 698 human-annotated pairs of political statements with explanations of the annotators' reasoning for 237 samples. The statements mainly come from voting assistant platforms such as Wahl-O-Mat in Germany and Smartvote in Switzerland, reflecting real-world political issues. We benchmark Large Language Models (LLMs) on our dataset and show that in general, they are as good as humans at detecting inconsistencies, and might be even better than individual humans at predicting the crowd-annotated ground-truth. However, when it comes to identifying fine-grained inconsistency types, none of the model have reached the upper bound of performance (due to natural labeling variation), thus leaving room for improvement. We make our dataset and code publicly available.

  The advent of large reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, has significantly advanced complex reasoning tasks. However, their capabilities in multilingual complex reasoning remain underexplored, with existing efforts largely focused on simpler tasks like MGSM. To address this gap, we introduce MMATH, a benchmark for multilingual complex reasoning spanning 374 high-quality math problems across 10 typologically diverse languages. Using MMATH, we observe that even advanced models like DeepSeek R1 exhibit substantial performance disparities across languages and suffer from a critical off-target issue-generating responses in unintended languages. To address this, we explore strategies including prompting and training, demonstrating that reasoning in English and answering in target languages can simultaneously enhance performance and preserve target-language consistency. Our findings offer new insights and practical strategies for advancing the multilingual reasoning capabilities of large language models. Our code and data could be found atthis https URL.

  Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, they still face challenges in knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning. Recent work explores iterative retrieval to address complex problems. However, the lack of intermediate guidance often results in inaccurate retrieval and flawed intermediate reasoning, leading to incorrect reasoning. To address these, we propose Self-Critique Guided Iterative Reasoning (SiGIR), which uses self-critique feedback to guide the iterative reasoning process. Specifically, through end-to-end training, we enable the model to iteratively address complex problems via question decomposition. Additionally, the model is able to self-evaluate its intermediate reasoning steps. During iterative reasoning, the model engages in branching exploration and employs self-evaluation to guide the selection of promising reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop reasoning datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing the previous SOTA by $8.6\%$. Furthermore, our thorough analysis offers insights for future research. Our code, data, and models are available at Github:this https URL.

  Existing mathematical reasoning benchmarks are predominantly English only or translation-based, which can introduce semantic drift and mask languagespecific reasoning errors. To address this, we present AI4Math, a benchmark of 105 original university level math problems natively authored in Spanish. The dataset spans seven advanced domains (Algebra, Calculus, Geometry, Probability, Number Theory, Combinatorics, and Logic), and each problem is accompanied by a step by step human solution. We evaluate six large language models GPT 4o, GPT 4o mini, o3 mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, DeepSeek R1 685B, and DeepSeek V3 685B under four configurations: zero shot and chain of thought, each in Spanish and English. The top models (o3 mini, DeepSeek R1 685B, DeepSeek V3 685B) achieve over 70% accuracy, whereas LLaMA 3.3 70B and GPT-4o mini remain below 40%. Most models show no significant performance drop between languages, with GPT 4o even performing better on Spanish problems in the zero shot setting. Geometry, Combinatorics, and Probability questions remain persistently challenging for all models. These results highlight the need for native-language benchmarks and domain-specific evaluations to reveal reasoning failures not captured by standard metrics.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on natural language tasks, but their decision-making processes remain largely opaque. Existing explanation methods either suffer from limited faithfulness to the model's reasoning or produce explanations that humans find difficult to understand. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ProtoSurE}, a novel prototype-based surrogate framework that provides faithful and human-understandable explanations for LLMs. ProtoSurE trains an interpretable-by-design surrogate model that aligns with the target LLM while utilizing sentence-level prototypes as human-understandable concepts. Extensive experiments show that ProtoSurE consistently outperforms SOTA explanation methods across diverse LLMs and datasets. Importantly, ProtoSurE demonstrates strong data efficiency, requiring relatively few training examples to achieve good performance, making it practical for real-world applications.

  Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to move beyond fast System-1 responses and engage in deliberative System-2 reasoning. However, this comes at the cost of significant inefficiency due to verbose intermediate output. Recent latent-space reasoning methods improve efficiency by operating on hidden states without decoding into language, yet they treat all steps uniformly, failing to distinguish critical deductions from auxiliary steps and resulting in suboptimal use of computational resources. In this paper, we propose System-1.5 Reasoning, an adaptive reasoning framework that dynamically allocates computation across reasoning steps through shortcut paths in latentthis http URL, System-1.5 Reasoning introduces two types of dynamic shortcuts. The model depth shortcut (DS) adaptively reasons along the vertical depth by early exiting non-critical tokens through lightweight adapter branches, while allowing critical tokens to continue through deeper Transformer layers. The step shortcut (SS) reuses hidden states across the decoding steps to skip trivial steps and reason horizontally in latent space. Training System-1.5 Reasoning involves a two-stage self-distillation process: first distilling natural language CoT into latent-space continuous thought, and then distilling full-path System-2 latent reasoning into adaptive shortcut paths (System-1.5 Reasoning).Experiments on reasoning tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our method. For example, on GSM8K, System-1.5 Reasoning achieves reasoning performance comparable to traditional CoT fine-tuning methods while accelerating inference by over 20x and reducing token generation by 92.31% on average.

  The Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark has been widely used to evaluate language models across various domains. However, existing MMLU datasets primarily focus on high-resource languages such as English, which leaves low-resource languages like Bengali underrepresented. In this paper, we introduce BnMMLU, a benchmark to evaluate the multitask language understanding capabilities of Bengali in language models. The dataset spans 23 domains, including science, humanities, mathematics and general knowledge and is structured in a multiple-choice format to assess factual knowledge, application-based problem-solving and reasoning abilities of language models. It consists of 138,949 question-option pairs. We benchmark several proprietary and open-source large language models (LLMs) on the BnMMLU test set. Additionally, we annotate the test set with three cognitive categories-factual knowledge, procedural application and reasoning-to gain deeper insights into model strengths and weaknesses across various cognitive tasks. The results reveal significant performance gaps, highlighting the need for improved pre-training and fine-tuning strategies tailored to Bengali data. We release the dataset and benchmark results to facilitate further research in this area.

  Human social interactions depend on the ability to infer others' unspoken intentions, emotions, and beliefs-a cognitive skill grounded in the psychological concept of Theory of Mind (ToM). While large language models (LLMs) excel in semantic understanding tasks, they struggle with the ambiguity and contextual nuance inherent in human communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MetaMind, a multi-agent framework inspired by psychological theories of metacognition, designed to emulate human-like social reasoning. MetaMind decomposes social understanding into three collaborative stages: (1) a Theory-of-Mind Agent generates hypotheses user mental states (e.g., intent, emotion), (2) a Domain Agent refines these hypotheses using cultural norms and ethical constraints, and (3) a Response Agent generates contextually appropriate responses while validating alignment with inferred intent. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks, with 35.7% improvement in real-world social scenarios and 6.2% gain in ToM reasoning. Notably, it enables LLMs to match human-level performance on key ToM tasks for the first time. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of all components, which showcase the framework's ability to balance contextual plausibility, social appropriateness, and user adaptation. This work advances AI systems toward human-like social intelligence, with applications in empathetic dialogue and culturally sensitive interactions. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Knowledge editing aims to update the embedded knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches, whether through parameter modification or external memory integration, often suffer from inconsistent evaluation objectives and experimental setups. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive benchmarking study. In addition to fact-level datasets, we introduce more complex event-based datasets and general-purpose datasets drawn from other tasks. Our evaluation covers both instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs, under a realistic autoregressive inference setting rather than teacher-forced decoding. Beyond single-edit assessments, we also evaluate multi-edit scenarios to better reflect practical demands. We employ four evaluation dimensions, including portability, and compare all recent methods against a simple and straightforward baseline named Selective Contextual Reasoning (SCR). Empirical results reveal that parameter-based editing methods perform poorly under realistic conditions. In contrast, SCR consistently outperforms them across all settings. This study offers new insights into the limitations of current knowledge editing methods and highlights the potential of context-based reasoning as a more robust alternative.

  Clarifying the research framing of NLP artefacts (e.g., models, datasets, etc.) is crucial to aligning research with practical applications. Recent studies manually analyzed NLP research across domains, showing that few papers explicitly identify key stakeholders, intended uses, or appropriate contexts. In this work, we propose to automate this analysis, developing a three-component system that infers research framings by first extracting key elements (means, ends, stakeholders), then linking them through interpretable rules and contextual reasoning. We evaluate our approach on two domains: automated fact-checking using an existing dataset, and hate speech detection for which we annotate a new dataset-achieving consistent improvements over strong LLM baselines. Finally, we apply our system to recent automated fact-checking papers and uncover three notable trends: a rise in vague or underspecified research goals, increased emphasis on scientific exploration over application, and a shift toward supporting human fact-checkers rather than pursuing full automation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation allows a large language model (LLM) to guide a small language model (SLM) in reasoning tasks. Existing methods train the SLM to learn the long rationale in one iteration, resulting in two issues: 1) Long rationales lead to a large token-level batch size during training, making gradients of core reasoning tokens (i.e., the token will directly affect the correctness of subsequent reasoning) over-smoothed as they contribute a tiny fraction of the rationale. As a result, the SLM converges to sharp minima where it fails to grasp the reasoning logic. 2) The response is slow, as the SLM must generate a long rationale before reaching the answer. Therefore, we propose chunk-wise training (CWT), which uses a heuristic search to divide the rationale into internal semantically coherent chunks and focuses SLM on learning from only one chunk per iteration. In this way, CWT naturally isolates non-reasoning chunks that do not involve the core reasoning token (e.g., summary and transitional chunks) from the SLM learning for reasoning chunks, making the fraction of the core reasoning token increase in the corresponding iteration. Based on CWT, skip-thinking training (STT) is proposed. STT makes the SLM automatically skip non-reasoning medium chunks to reach the answer, improving reasoning speed while maintaining accuracy. We validate our approach on a variety of SLMs and multiple reasoning tasks.

  Recently, significant progress has been made in developing reasoning-capable Large Language Models (LLMs) through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. However, this long-CoT reasoning process imposes substantial memory overhead due to the large Key-Value (KV) Cache memory overhead. Post-training KV Cache quantization has emerged as a promising compression technique and has been extensively studied in short-context scenarios. However, directly applying existing methods to long-CoT LLMs causes significant performance degradation due to the following two reasons: (1) Large cumulative error: Existing methods fail to adequately leverage available memory, and they directly quantize the KV Cache during each decoding step, leading to large cumulative quantization error. (2) Short-context calibration: Due to Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE), the use of short-context data during calibration fails to account for the distribution of less frequent channels in the Key Cache, resulting in performance loss. We propose Progressive Mixed-Precision KV Cache Quantization (PM-KVQ) for long-CoT LLMs to address the above issues in two folds: (1) To reduce cumulative error, we design a progressive quantization strategy to gradually lower the bit-width of KV Cache in each block. Then, we propose block-wise memory allocation to assign a higher bit-width to more sensitive transformer blocks. (2) To increase the calibration length without additional overhead, we propose a new calibration strategy with positional interpolation that leverages short calibration data with positional interpolation to approximate the data distribution of long-context data. Extensive experiments on 7B-70B long-CoT LLMs show that PM-KVQ improves reasoning benchmark performance by up to 8% over SOTA baselines under the same memory budget.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning, positioning them as promising tools for supporting human problem-solving. However, what happens when their performance is affected by misinformation, i.e., incorrect inputs introduced by users due to oversights or gaps in knowledge? Such misinformation is prevalent in real-world interactions with LLMs, yet how it propagates within LLMs' reasoning process remains underexplored. Focusing on mathematical reasoning, we present a comprehensive analysis of how misinformation affects intermediate reasoning steps and final answers. We also examine how effectively LLMs can correct misinformation when explicitly instructed to do so. Even with explicit instructions, LLMs succeed less than half the time in rectifying misinformation, despite possessing correct internal knowledge, leading to significant accuracy drops (10.02% - 72.20%). Further analysis shows that applying factual corrections early in the reasoning process most effectively reduces misinformation propagation, and fine-tuning on synthesized data with early-stage corrections significantly improves reasoning factuality. Our work offers a practical approach to mitigating misinformation propagation.

  Current large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emerging capabilities in social intelligence tasks, including implicature resolution (Sravanthi et al. (2024)) and theory-of-mind reasoning (Shapira et al. (2024)), both of which require substantial pragmatic understanding. However, how LLMs acquire this competence throughout the training process remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce ALTPRAG, a dataset grounded in the pragmatic concept of alternatives, designed to evaluate whether LLMs at different training stages can accurately infer nuanced speaker intentions. Each instance pairs two contextually appropriate but pragmatically distinct continuations, enabling fine-grained assessment of both pragmatic interpretation and contrastive reasoning. We systematically evaluate 22 LLMs across key training stages: pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference optimization, to examine the development of pragmatic competence. Our results show that even base models exhibit notable sensitivity to pragmatic cues, which improves consistently with increases in model and data scale. Additionally, SFT and RLHF contribute further gains, particularly in cognitive-pragmatic reasoning. These findings highlight pragmatic competence as an emergent and compositional property of LLM training and offer new insights for aligning models with human communicative norms.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced latent reasoning as a promising alternative to autoregressive reasoning. By performing internal computation with hidden states from previous steps, latent reasoning benefit from more informative features rather than sampling a discrete chain-of-thought (CoT) path. Yet latent reasoning approaches are often incompatible with LLMs, as their continuous paradigm conflicts with the discrete nature of autoregressive generation. Moreover, these methods rely on CoT traces for training and thus fail to exploit the inherent reasoning patterns of LLMs. In this work, we explore latent reasoning by leveraging the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). To this end, we introduce hybrid reasoning policy optimization (HRPO), an RL-based hybrid latent reasoning approach that (1) integrates prior hidden states into sampled tokens with a learnable gating mechanism, and (2) initializes training with predominantly token embeddings while progressively incorporating more hidden features. This design maintains LLMs' generative capabilities and incentivizes hybrid reasoning using both discrete and continuous representations. In addition, the hybrid HRPO introduces stochasticity into latent reasoning via token sampling, thereby enabling RL-based optimization without requiring CoT trajectories. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks show that HRPO outperforms prior methods in both knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks. Furthermore, HRPO-trained LLMs remain interpretable and exhibit intriguing behaviors like cross-lingual patterns and shorter completion lengths, highlighting the potential of our RL-based approach and offer insights for future work in latent reasoning.

  Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their practical utility is often limited by persistent issues of hallucinations and outdated parametric knowledge. Although post-training model editing offers a pathway for dynamic updates, existing methods frequently suffer from overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry and graph neural networks for precise and stable model edits. We introduce HYPE (HYperbolic Parameter Editing), which comprises three key components: (i) Hyperbolic Graph Construction, which uses Poincar√© embeddings to represent knowledge triples in hyperbolic space, preserving hierarchical relationships and preventing unintended side effects by ensuring that edits to parent concepts do not inadvertently affect child concepts; (ii) M√∂bius-Transformed Updates, which apply hyperbolic addition to propagate edits while maintaining structural consistency within the hyperbolic manifold, unlike conventional Euclidean updates that distort relational distances; and (iii) Dual Stabilization, which combines gradient masking and periodic GNN parameter resetting to prevent catastrophic forgetting by focusing updates on critical parameters and preserving long-term knowledge. Experiments on CounterFact, CounterFact+, and MQuAKE with GPT-J and GPT2-XL demonstrate that HYPE significantly enhances edit stability, factual accuracy, and multi-hop reasoning.

  _Jinyan Su, Claire Cardie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in mathematical tasks, often enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL). However, RL-trained models frequently produce unnecessarily long reasoning traces -- even for simple queries -- leading to increased inference costs and latency. While recent approaches attempt to control verbosity by adding length penalties to the reward function, these methods rely on fixed penalty terms that are hard to tune and cannot adapt as the model's reasoning capability evolves, limiting their effectiveness. In this work, we propose an adaptive reward-shaping method that enables LLMs to "think fast and right" -- producing concise outputs without sacrificing correctness. Our method dynamically adjusts the reward trade-off between accuracy and response length based on model performance: when accuracy is high, the length penalty increases to encourage faster length reduction; when accuracy drops, the penalty is relaxed to preserve correctness. This adaptive reward accelerates early-stage length reduction while avoiding over-compression in later stages. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our approach consistently and dramatically reduces reasoning length while largely maintaining accuracy, offering a new direction for cost-efficient adaptive reasoning in large-scale language models.

  Arabic poetry is one of the richest and most culturally rooted forms of expression in the Arabic language, known for its layered meanings, stylistic diversity, and deep historical continuity. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across languages and tasks, their ability to understand Arabic poetry remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce \emph{Fann or Flop}, the first benchmark designed to assess the comprehension of Arabic poetry by LLMs in 12 historical eras, covering 14 core poetic genres and a variety of metrical forms, from classical structures to contemporary free verse. The benchmark comprises a curated corpus of poems with explanations that assess semantic understanding, metaphor interpretation, prosodic awareness, and cultural context. We argue that poetic comprehension offers a strong indicator for testing how good the LLM understands classical Arabic through Arabic poetry. Unlike surface-level tasks, this domain demands deeper interpretive reasoning and cultural sensitivity. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs shows that most models struggle with poetic understanding despite strong results on standard Arabic benchmarks. We release "Fann or Flop" along with the evaluation suite as an open-source resource to enable rigorous evaluation and advancement for Arabic language models. Code is available at:this https URL.

  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in complex reasoning tasks. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on single-turn reasoning scenarios, leaving interactive tasks largely unexplored. We attribute it to the absence of comprehensive datasets and scalable automatic evaluation protocols. To fill these gaps, we present MTR-Bench for LLMs' Multi-Turn Reasoning evaluation. Comprising 4 classes, 40 tasks, and 3600 instances, MTR-Bench covers diverse reasoning capabilities, fine-grained difficulty granularity, and necessitates multi-turn interactions with the environments. Moreover, MTR-Bench features fully-automated framework spanning both dataset constructions and model evaluations, which enables scalable assessment without human interventions. Extensive experiments reveal that even the cutting-edge reasoning models fall short of multi-turn, interactive reasoning tasks. And the further analysis upon these results brings valuable insights for future research in interactive AI systems.

  Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated superior logical capabilities compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), gaining significant attention. Despite their impressive performance, the potential for stronger reasoning abilities to introduce more severe security vulnerabilities remains largely underexplored. Existing jailbreak methods often struggle to balance effectiveness with robustness against adaptive safety mechanisms. In this work, we propose SEAL, a novel jailbreak attack that targets LRMs through an adaptive encryption pipeline designed to override their reasoning processes and evade potential adaptive alignment. Specifically, SEAL introduces a stacked encryption approach that combines multiple ciphers to overwhelm the models reasoning capabilities, effectively bypassing built-in safety mechanisms. To further prevent LRMs from developing countermeasures, we incorporate two dynamic strategies - random and adaptive - that adjust the cipher length, order, and combination. Extensive experiments on real-world reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1, Claude Sonnet, and OpenAI GPT-o4, validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, SEAL achieves an attack success rate of 80.8% on GPT o4-mini, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin of 27.2%.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite LLMs' explicit alignment against demographic stereotypes, they have been shown to exhibit biases under various social contexts. In this work, we find that LLMs exhibit concerning biases in how they associate solution veracity with demographics. Through experiments across five human value-aligned LLMs on mathematics, coding, commonsense, and writing problems, we reveal two forms of such veracity biases: Attribution Bias, where models disproportionately attribute correct solutions to certain demographic groups, and Evaluation Bias, where models' assessment of identical solutions varies based on perceived demographic authorship. Our results show pervasive biases: LLMs consistently attribute fewer correct solutions and more incorrect ones to African-American groups in math and coding, while Asian authorships are least preferred in writing evaluation. In additional studies, we show LLMs automatically assign racially stereotypical colors to demographic groups in visualization code, suggesting these biases are deeply embedded in models' reasoning processes. Our findings indicate that demographic bias extends beyond surface-level stereotypes and social context provocations, raising concerns about LLMs' deployment in educational and evaluation settings.

  Large reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1 and Deepseek-R1 have recently attracted widespread attention due to their impressive task-solving abilities. However, the enormous model size and the generation of lengthy thought chains introduce significant reasoning costs and response latency. Existing methods for efficient reasoning mainly focus on reducing the number of model parameters or shortening the chain-of-thought length. In this paper, we introduce Speculative Chain-of-Thought (SCoT), which reduces reasoning latency from another perspective by accelerated average reasoning speed through large and small model collaboration. SCoT conducts thought-level drafting using a lightweight draft model. Then it selects the best CoT draft and corrects the error cases with the target model. The proposed thinking behavior alignment improves the efficiency of drafting and the draft selection strategy maintains the prediction accuracy of the target model for complex tasks. Experimental results on GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, CollegeMath and Olympiad datasets show that SCoT reduces reasoning latency by 48\%$\sim$66\% and 21\%$\sim$49\% for Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B while achieving near-target-model-level performance.

  Recent research shows that LLMs can simulate ``believable'' human behaviors to power LLM agents via prompt-only methods. In this work, we focus on evaluating LLM's objective ``accuracy'' rather than the subjective ``believability'' in simulating human behavior, leveraging a large-scale, real-world dataset collected from customers' online shopping actions. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, Llama, and Claude) on the task of web shopping action generation. Our results show that out-of-the-box LLM-generated actions are often misaligned with actual human behavior, whereas fine-tuning LLMs on real-world behavioral data substantially improves their ability to generate accurate actions compared to prompt-only methods. Furthermore, incorporating synthesized reasonings into model training leads to additional performance gains, demonstrating the value of explicit rationale in behavior modeling. This work evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs in behavior simulation and provides actionable insights into how real-world action data can enhance the fidelity of LLM agents.

  Improving training efficiency continues to be one of the primary challenges in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate how context length and the complexity of training data influence the RL scaling training process of R1-distilled small reasoning models, e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) simply controlling the context length and curating the training data based on the input prompt length can effectively improve the training efficiency of scaling RL, achieving better performance with more concise CoT; (2) properly scaling the context length helps mitigate entropy collapse; and (3) choosing an optimal context length can improve the efficiency of model training and incentivize the model's chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities. Inspired by these insights, we propose FastCuRL, a curriculum RL framework with stage-wise context scaling to achieve efficient training and concise CoT reasoning. Experiment results demonstrate that FastCuRL-1.5B-V3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on five competition-level benchmarks and achieves 49.6\% accuracy on AIME 2024. Furthermore, FastCuRL-1.5B-Preview surpasses DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview on five benchmarks while only using a single node with 8 GPUs and a total of 50\% of training steps. %The code, training data, and models will be publicly released.

  NLP research has increasingly focused on subjective tasks such as emotion analysis. However, existing emotion benchmarks suffer from two major shortcomings: (1) they largely rely on keyword-based emotion recognition, overlooking crucial cultural dimensions required for deeper emotion understanding, and (2) many are created by translating English-annotated data into other languages, leading to potentially unreliable evaluation. To address these issues, we introduce Cultural Lenses on Emotion (CuLEmo), the first benchmark designed to evaluate culture-aware emotion prediction across six languages: Amharic, Arabic, English, German, Hindi, and Spanish. CuLEmo comprises 400 crafted questions per language, each requiring nuanced cultural reasoning and understanding. We use this benchmark to evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs on culture-aware emotion prediction and sentiment analysis tasks. Our findings reveal that (1) emotion conceptualizations vary significantly across languages and cultures, (2) LLMs performance likewise varies by language and cultural context, and (3) prompting in English with explicit country context often outperforms in-language prompts for culture-aware emotion and sentiment understanding. The dataset and evaluation code are publicly available.

  Existing large language model (LLM) evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on English, while current multilingual tasks lack parallel questions that specifically assess cross-linguistic reasoning abilities. This dual limitation makes it challenging to comprehensively assess LLMs' performance in the multilingual setting. To fill this gap, we introduce MMLU-ProX, a comprehensive benchmark covering 29 languages, built on an English benchmark. Each language version consists of 11,829 identical questions, enabling direct cross-linguistic comparisons. Additionally, to meet efficient evaluation needs, we provide a lite version containing 658 questions per language. To ensure the high quality of MMLU-ProX, we employ a rigorous development process that involves multiple powerful LLMs for translation, followed by expert review to ensure accurate expression, consistent terminology, and cultural relevance. Building on this, we systematically evaluate 36 state-of-the-art LLMs, including reasoning-enhanced and multilingual-optimized LLMs. The results reveal significant disparities in the multilingual capabilities of LLMs: While they perform well in high-resource languages, their performance declines markedly in low-resource languages, with gaps of up to 24.3%. Through MMLU-ProX, we aim to advance the development of more inclusive AI systems and promote equitable access to technology across global contexts.

  The ability to understand and predict the mental states of oneself and others, known as the Theory of Mind (ToM), is crucial for effective social scenarios. Although recent studies have evaluated ToM in Large Language Models (LLMs), existing benchmarks focus on simplified settings (e.g., Sally-Anne-style tasks) and overlook the complexity of real-world social interactions. To mitigate this gap, we propose PersuasiveToM, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ToM abilities of LLMs in persuasive dialogues. Our framework contains two core tasks: ToM Reasoning, which tests tracking of evolving desires, beliefs, and intentions; and ToM Application, which assesses the use of inferred mental states to predict and evaluate persuasion strategies. Experiments across eight leading LLMs reveal that while models excel on multiple questions, they struggle with the tasks that need tracking the dynamics and shifts of mental states and understanding the mental states in the whole dialogue comprehensively. Our aim with PersuasiveToM is to allow an effective evaluation of the ToM reasoning ability of LLMs with more focus on complex psychological activities. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Despite recent breakthroughs in reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) like DeepSeek-R1, incorporating inference-time reasoning into machine translation (MT), where human translators naturally employ structured, multi-layered reasoning chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), is yet underexplored. Existing methods either design a fixed CoT tailored for a specific MT sub-task (e.g., literature translation), or rely on synthesizing CoTs unaligned with humans and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) prone to overfitting, limiting their adaptability to diverse translation scenarios. This paper introduces R1-Translator (R1-T1), a novel framework to achieve inference-time reasoning for general MT via reinforcement learning (RL) with human-aligned CoTs comprising six common patterns. Our approach pioneers three innovations: (1) extending reasoning-based translation to broader MT scenarios (e.g., multilingual MT, domain MT) unseen in the training phase; (2) formalizing six expert-curated CoT templates that mirror hybrid human strategies like context-aware paraphrasing and back translation; and (3) enabling self-evolving CoT discovery through RL. Both human and automatic evaluation results indicate a steady translation performance improvement in a total of 10+ languages and 40+ translation directions on Flores-101 test set and four domain-specific MT tasks, especially on the languages unseen from training.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning tasks through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, CoT prompting greatly increases computational demands, which has prompted growing interest in distilling CoT capabilities into Small Language Models (SLMs). This study systematically examines the factors influencing CoT distillation, including the choice of granularity, format and teacher model. Through experiments involving four teacher models and seven student models across seven mathematical and commonsense reasoning datasets, we uncover three key findings: (1) Unlike LLMs, SLMs exhibit a non-monotonic relationship with granularity, with stronger models benefiting from finer-grained reasoning and weaker models performing better with simpler CoT supervision; (2) CoT format significantly impacts LLMs but has minimal effect on SLMs, likely due to their reliance on supervised fine-tuning rather than pretraining preferences; (3) Stronger teacher models do NOT always produce better student models, as diversity and complexity in CoT supervision can outweigh accuracy alone. These findings emphasize the need to tailor CoT strategies to specific student model, offering actionable insights for optimizing CoT distillation in SLMs. The code and datasets are available atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) are widely used, but they often generate subtle factual errors, especially in long-form text. These errors are fatal in some specialized domains such as medicine. Existing fact-checking with grounding documents methods face two main challenges: (1) they struggle to understand complex multihop relations in long documents, often overlooking subtle factual errors; (2) most specialized methods rely on pairwise comparisons, requiring multiple model calls, leading to high resource and computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose GraphCheck, a fact-checking framework that uses extracted knowledge graphs to enhance text representation. Graph Neural Networks further process these graphs as a soft prompt, enabling LLMs to incorporate structured knowledge more effectively. Enhanced with graph-based reasoning, GraphCheck captures multihop reasoning chains that are often overlooked by existing methods, enabling precise and efficient fact-checking in a single inference call. Experimental results on seven benchmarks spanning both general and medical domains demonstrate up to a 7.1% overall improvement over baseline models. Notably, GraphCheck outperforms existing specialized fact-checkers and achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art LLMs, such as DeepSeek-V3 and OpenAI-o1, with significantly fewer parameters.

  We introduce Fraud-R1, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to defend against internet fraud and phishing in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Fraud-R1 comprises 8,564 fraud cases sourced from phishing scams, fake job postings, social media, and news, categorized into 5 major fraud types. Unlike previous benchmarks, Fraud-R1 introduces a multi-round evaluation pipeline to assess LLMs' resistance to fraud at different stages, including credibility building, urgency creation, and emotional manipulation. Furthermore, we evaluate 15 LLMs under two settings: 1. Helpful-Assistant, where the LLM provides general decision-making assistance, and 2. Role-play, where the model assumes a specific persona, widely used in real-world agent-based interactions. Our evaluation reveals the significant challenges in defending against fraud and phishing inducement, especially in role-play settings and fake job postings. Additionally, we observe a substantial performance gap between Chinese and English, underscoring the need for improved multilingual fraud detection capabilities.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in commonsense reasoning; however, some variations in questions can trigger incorrect responses. Do these models truly understand commonsense knowledge, or just memorize expression patterns? To investigate this question, we present the first extensive robustness evaluation of LLMs in commonsense reasoning. We introduce HellaSwag-Pro, a large-scale bilingual benchmark consisting of 11,200 cases, by designing and compiling seven types of question variants. To construct this benchmark, we propose a two-stage method to develop Chinese HellaSwag, a finely annotated dataset comprising 12,000 instances across 56 categories. We conduct extensive experiments on 41 representative LLMs, revealing that these LLMs are far from robust in commonsense reasoning. Furthermore, this robustness varies depending on the language in which the LLM is tested. This work establishes a high-quality evaluation benchmark, with extensive experiments offering valuable insights to the community in commonsense reasoning for LLMs.

  In-context learning (ICL) enhances the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by prepending a few demonstrations. It motivates researchers to introduce more examples to provide additional contextual information for the generation. However, existing methods show a significant limitation due to the problem of excessive growth in context length, which causes a large hardware burden. In addition, shallow-relevant examples selected by off-the-shelf tools hinder LLMs from capturing useful contextual information for generation. In this paper, we propose \textbf{UniICL}, a novel \textbf{Uni}fied \textbf{ICL} framework that unifies demonstration compression, demonstration selection, and final response generation. Furthermore, to boost inference efficiency, we design a tailored compression strategy that allows UniICL to cache compression results into \textbf{Demonstration Bank} (\textbf{DB}), which avoids repeated compression of the same demonstration. Extensive out-of-domain evaluations prove the advantages of UniICL in both effectiveness and efficiency.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in various tasks, however, there remains a significant lack of open-source models and data for specific domains. Previous work has primarily focused on manually specifying resources and collecting high-quality data for specific domains, which is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this limitation, we introduce large models into the data collection pipeline to guide the generation of domain-specific information and retrieve relevant data from Common Crawl (CC), a large public corpus. We refer to this approach as Retrieve-from-CC. It not only collects data related to domain-specific knowledge but also mines the data containing potential reasoning procedures from the public corpus. By applying this method, we have collected a knowledge domain-related dataset named Retrieve-Pile, which covers four main domains, including the sciences, humanities, and other categories. Through the analysis of , Retrieve-from-CC can effectively retrieve relevant data from the covered knowledge domains and significantly improve the performance in tests of mathematical and knowledge-related reasoning abilities. We have released Retrieve-Pile atthis https URL.

  Self-awareness - the ability to distinguish oneself from the surrounding environment - underpins intelligent, autonomous behavior. Recent advances in AI achieve human-like performance in tasks integrating multimodal information, particularly in large language models, raising interest in the embodiment capabilities of AI agents on nonhuman platforms such as robots. Here, we explore whether multimodal LLMs can develop self-awareness solely through sensorimotor experiences. By integrating a multimodal LLM into an autonomous mobile robot, we test its ability to achieve this capacity. We find that the system exhibits robust environmental awareness, self-recognition and predictive awareness, allowing it to infer its robotic nature and motion characteristics. Structural equation modeling reveals how sensory integration influences distinct dimensions of self-awareness and its coordination with past-present memory, as well as the hierarchical internal associations that drive self-identification. Ablation tests of sensory inputs identify critical modalities for each dimension, demonstrate compensatory interactions among sensors and confirm the essential role of structured and episodic memory in coherent reasoning. These findings demonstrate that, given appropriate sensory information about the world and itself, multimodal LLMs exhibit emergent self-awareness, opening the door to artificial embodied cognitive systems.

  This study presents the LLM-Agent-Controller, a multi-agent large language model (LLM) system developed to address a wide range of problems in control engineering (Control Theory). The system integrates a central controller agent with multiple specialized auxiliary agents, responsible for tasks such as controller design, model representation, control analysis, time-domain response, and simulation. A supervisor oversees high-level decision-making and workflow coordination, enhancing the system's reliability and efficiency. The LLM-Agent-Controller incorporates advanced capabilities, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Chain-of-Thought reasoning, self-criticism and correction, efficient memory handling, and user-friendly natural language communication. It is designed to function without requiring users to have prior knowledge of Control Theory, enabling them to input problems in plain language and receive complete, real-time solutions. To evaluate the system, we propose new performance metrics assessing both individual agents and the system as a whole. We test five categories of Control Theory problems and benchmark performance across three advanced LLMs. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive qualitative conversational analysis covering all key services. Results show that the LLM-Agent-Controller successfully solved 83% of general tasks, with individual agents achieving an average success rate of 87%. Performance improved with more advanced LLMs. This research demonstrates the potential of multi-agent LLM architectures to solve complex, domain-specific problems. By integrating specialized agents, supervisory control, and advanced reasoning, the LLM-Agent-Controller offers a scalable, robust, and accessible solution framework that can be extended to various technical domains.

  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is intended to improve their reasoning capabilities, yet we uncover a counterintuitive effect: models often forget how to solve problems they previously answered correctly during training. We term this phenomenon temporal forgetting and show that it is widespread across model sizes, fine-tuning methods (both Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Fine-Tuning), and multiple reasoning benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce Temporal Sampling, a simple decoding strategy that draws outputs from multiple checkpoints along the training trajectory. This approach recovers forgotten solutions without retraining or ensembling, and leads to substantial improvements in reasoning performance, gains from 4 to 19 points in Pass@k and consistent gains in Majority@k across several benchmarks. We further extend our method to LoRA-adapted models, demonstrating that storing only adapter weights across checkpoints achieves similar benefits with minimal storage cost. By leveraging the temporal diversity inherent in training, Temporal Sampling offers a practical, compute-efficient way to surface hidden reasoning ability and rethink how we evaluate LLMs.

  Data-centric distillation, including data augmentation, selection, and mixing, offers a promising path to creating smaller, more efficient student Large Language Models (LLMs) that retain strong reasoning abilities. However, there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark to systematically assess the effect of each distillation approach. This paper introduces DC-CoT, the first data-centric benchmark that investigates data manipulation in chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation from method, model and data perspectives. Utilizing various teacher models (e.g., o4-mini, Gemini-Pro, Claude-3.5) and student architectures (e.g., 3B, 7B parameters), we rigorously evaluate the impact of these data manipulations on student model performance across multiple reasoning datasets, with a focus on in-distribution (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and cross-domain transfer. Our findings aim to provide actionable insights and establish best practices for optimizing CoT distillation through data-centric techniques, ultimately facilitating the development of more accessible and capable reasoning models.

  This paper aims to understand how neural networks learn algorithmic reasoning by addressing two questions: How faithful are learned algorithms when they are effective, and why do neural networks fail to learn effective algorithms otherwise? To answer these questions, we use neural compilation, a technique that directly encodes a source algorithm into neural network parameters, enabling the network to compute the algorithm exactly. This enables comparison between compiled and conventionally learned parameters, intermediate vectors, and behaviors. This investigation is crucial for developing neural networks that robustly learn complexalgorithms from data. Our analysis focuses on graph neural networks (GNNs), which are naturally aligned with algorithmic reasoning tasks, specifically our choices of BFS, DFS, and Bellman-Ford, which cover the spectrum of effective, faithful, and ineffective learned algorithms. Commonly, learning algorithmic reasoning is framed as induction over synthetic data, where a parameterized model is trained on inputs, traces, and outputs produced by an underlying ground truth algorithm. In contrast, we introduce a neural compilation method for GNNs, which sets network parameters analytically, bypassing training. Focusing on GNNs leverages their alignment with algorithmic reasoning, extensive algorithmic induction literature, and the novel application of neural compilation to GNNs. Overall, this paper aims to characterize expressability-trainability gaps - a fundamental shortcoming in learning algorithmic reasoning. We hypothesize that inductive learning is most effective for parallel algorithms contained within the computational class \texttt{NC}.

  Accurate prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events recurrence risk in acute myocardial infarction patients based on postoperative cardiac MRI and associated clinical notes is crucial for precision treatment and personalized intervention. Existing methods primarily focus on risk stratification capability while overlooking the need for intermediate robust reasoning and model interpretability in clinical practice. Moreover, end-to-end risk prediction using LLM/VLM faces significant challenges due to data limitations and modeling complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose CardioCoT, a novel two-stage hierarchical reasoning-enhanced survival analysis framework designed to enhance both model interpretability and predictive performance. In the first stage, we employ an evidence-augmented self-refinement mechanism to guide LLM/VLMs in generating robust hierarchical reasoning trajectories based on associated radiological findings. In the second stage, we integrate the reasoning trajectories with imaging data for risk model training and prediction. CardioCoT demonstrates superior performance in MACE recurrence risk prediction while providing interpretable reasoning processes, offering valuable insights for clinical decision-making.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in document understanding. However, the information-dense nature of document images still poses challenges, as most queries depend on only a few relevant regions, with the rest being redundant. Existing one-pass MLLMs process entire document images without considering query relevance, often failing to focus on critical regions and producing unfaithful responses. Inspired by the human coarse-to-fine reading pattern, we introduce Doc-CoB (Chain-of-Box), a simple-yet-effective mechanism that integrates human-style visual reasoning into MLLM without modifying its architecture. Our method allows the model to autonomously select the set of regions (boxes) most relevant to the query, and then focus attention on them for further understanding. We first design a fully automatic pipeline, integrating a commercial MLLM with a layout analyzer, to generate 249k training samples with intermediate visual reasoning supervision. Then we incorporate two enabling tasks that improve box identification and box-query reasoning, which together enhance document understanding. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks with four popular models show that Doc-CoB significantly improves performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and wide applicability. All code, data, and models will be released publicly.

  Training multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that align with human intentions is a long-term challenge. Traditional score-only reward models for alignment suffer from low accuracy, weak generalization, and poor interpretability, blocking the progress of alignment methods, e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Generative reward models (GRMs) leverage MLLMs' intrinsic reasoning capabilities to discriminate pair-wise responses, but their pair-wise paradigm makes it hard to generalize to learnable rewards. We introduce Generative RLHF-V, a novel alignment framework that integrates GRMs with multi-modal RLHF. We propose a two-stage pipeline: $\textbf{multi-modal generative reward modeling from RL}$, where RL guides GRMs to actively capture human intention, then predict the correct pair-wise scores; and $\textbf{RL optimization from grouped comparison}$, which enhances multi-modal RL scoring precision by grouped responses comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that, besides out-of-distribution generalization of RM discrimination, our framework improves 4 MLLMs' performance across 7 benchmarks by $18.1\%$, while the baseline RLHF is only $5.3\%$. We further validate that Generative RLHF-V achieves a near-linear improvement with an increasing number of candidate responses. Our code and models can be found atthis https URL.

  Self-taught reasoners (STaRs) enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging self-generated responses for self-training. Recent studies have incorporated reward models to guide response selection or decoding, aiming to obtain higher-quality data. However, they typically allocate a uniform sampling budget across all problems, overlooking the varying utility of problems at different difficulty levels. In this work, we conduct an empirical study and find that problems near the boundary of the LLM's reasoning capability offer significantly greater learning utility than both easy and overly difficult ones. To identify and exploit such problems, we propose HS-STaR, a Hierarchical Sampling framework for Self-Taught Reasoners. Given a fixed sampling budget, HS-STaR first performs lightweight pre-sampling with a reward-guided difficulty estimation strategy to efficiently identify boundary-level problems. Subsequently, it dynamically reallocates the remaining budget toward these high-utility problems during a re-sampling phase, maximizing the generation of valuable training data. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks and backbone LLMs demonstrate that HS-STaR significantly outperforms other baselines without requiring additional sampling budget.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general capabilities, but enhancing skills such as reasoning often demands substantial computational resources and may compromise their generalization. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods offer a more resource-conscious alternative, they typically requires retraining for each LLM backbone due to architectural dependencies. To address these challenges, here we propose Universal Reasoner (UniR) - a single, lightweight, composable, and plug-and-play reasoning module that can be used with any frozen LLM to endow it with specialized reasoning capabilities. Specifically, UniR decomposes the reward into a standalone reasoning module that is trained independently using predefined rewards, effectively translating trajectory-level signals into token-level guidance. Once trained, UniR can be combined with any frozen LLM at inference time by simply adding its output logits to those of the LLM backbone. This additive structure naturally enables modular composition: multiple UniR modules trained for different tasks can be jointly applied by summing their logits, enabling complex reasoning via composition. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and machine translation tasks show that UniR significantly outperforms \add{existing baseline fine-tuning methods using the Llama3.2 model}. Furthermore, UniR demonstrates strong weak-to-strong generalization: reasoning modules trained on smaller models effectively guide much larger LLMs. This makes UniR a cost-efficient, adaptable, and robust solution for enhancing reasoning in LLMs without compromising their core capabilities.

  Understanding and inferring causal relationships from texts is a core aspect of human cognition and is essential for advancing large language models (LLMs) towards artificial general intelligence. Existing work primarily focuses on synthetically generated texts which involve simple causal relationships explicitly mentioned in the text. This fails to reflect the complexities of real-world tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs are capable of inferring causal relationships from real-world texts. We develop a benchmark drawn from real-world academic literature which includes diverse texts with respect to length, complexity of relationships (different levels of explicitness, number of events, and causal relationships), and domains and sub-domains. To the best of our knowledge, our benchmark is the first-ever real-world dataset for this task. Our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs evaluated on our proposed benchmark demonstrate significant challenges, with the best-performing model achieving an average F1 score of only 0.477. Analysis reveals common pitfalls: difficulty with implicitly stated information, in distinguishing relevant causal factors from surrounding contextual details, and with connecting causally relevant information spread across lengthy textual passages. By systematically characterizing these deficiencies, our benchmark offers targeted insights for further research into advancing LLM causal reasoning.

  Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents demonstrate strong reasoning and tool use capabilities, but often lack self-awareness, failing to balance these approaches effectively. This imbalance leads to Tool Overuse, where models unnecessarily rely on external tools for tasks solvable with parametric knowledge, increasing computational overhead. Inspired by human metacognition, we introduce SMART (Strategic Model-Aware Reasoning with Tools), a paradigm that enhances an agent's self-awareness to optimize task handling and reduce tool overuse. To support this paradigm, we introduce SMART-ER, a dataset spanning three domains, where reasoning alternates between parametric knowledge and tool-dependent steps, with each step enriched by rationales explaining when tools are necessary. Through supervised training, we develop SMARTAgent, a family of models that dynamically balance parametric knowledge and tool use. Evaluations show that SMARTAgent reduces tool use by 24% while improving performance by over 37%, enabling 7B-scale models to match its 70B counterpart and GPT-4o. Additionally, SMARTAgent generalizes to out-of-distribution test data like GSM8K and MINTQA, maintaining accuracy with just one-fifth the tool calls. These highlight the potential of strategic tool use to enhance reasoning, mitigate overuse, and bridge the gap between model size and performance, advancing intelligent and resource-efficient agent designs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to deconstruct complex problems. While longer CoTs are often presumed superior, this paper challenges that notion, arguing that longer is not always better. Drawing on combined evidence from real-world observations, controlled experiments, and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that task accuracy typically follows an inverted U-shaped curve with CoT length, where performance initially improves but eventually decreases as the number of CoT steps increases. With controlled experiments, we further uncover the scaling behaviors of the optimal CoT length: it increases with task difficulty but decreases with model capability, exposing an inherent simplicity bias where more capable models favor shorter, more efficient CoT reasoning. This bias is also evident in Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, where models gravitate towards shorter CoTs as their accuracy improves. To have a deep understanding of these dynamics, we establish a simple theoretical model that formally proves these phenomena, including the optimal length's scaling laws and the emergence of simplicity bias during RL. Guided by this framework, we demonstrate significant practical benefits from training with optimally-lengthed CoTs and employing length-aware filtering at inference. These findings offer both a principled understanding of the "overthinking" phenomenon and multiple practical guidelines for CoT calibration, enabling LLMs to achieve optimal reasoning performance with adaptive CoTs tailored to task complexity and model capability.

  As language models regularly make mistakes when solving math problems, automated identification of errors in the reasoning process becomes increasingly significant for their scalable oversight. In this paper, we introduce ProcessBench for measuring the ability to identify erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning. It consists of 3,400 test cases, primarily focused on competition- and Olympiad-level math problems. Each test case contains a step-by-step solution with error location annotated by human experts. Models are required to identify the earliest step that contains an error, or conclude that all steps are correct. We conduct extensive evaluation on ProcessBench, involving two types of models: process reward models (PRMs) and critic models, where for the latter we prompt general language models to critique each solution step by step. We draw two main observations: (1) Existing PRMs typically fail to generalize to more challenging math problems beyond GSM8K and MATH. They underperform both critic models (i.e., prompted general language models) and our own trained PRM that is straightforwardly fine-tuned on the PRM800K dataset. (2) The best open-source model, QwQ-32B-Preview, has demonstrated the critique capability competitive with the proprietary model GPT-4o, despite that it still lags behind the reasoning-specialized o1-mini. We hope ProcessBench can foster future research in reasoning process assessment, paving the way toward scalable oversight of language models.

  Empathetic response generation necessitates the integration of emotional and intentional dynamics to foster meaningful interactions. Existing research either neglects the intricate interplay between emotion and intent, leading to suboptimal controllability of empathy, or resorts to large language models (LLMs), which incur significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ReflectDiffu, a lightweight and comprehensive framework for empathetic response generation. This framework incorporates emotion contagion to augment emotional expressiveness and employs an emotion-reasoning mask to pinpoint critical emotional elements. Additionally, it integrates intent mimicry within reinforcement learning for refinement during diffusion. By harnessing an intent twice reflect mechanism of Exploring-Sampling-Correcting, ReflectDiffu adeptly translates emotional decision-making into precise intent actions, thereby addressing empathetic response misalignments stemming from emotional misrecognition. Through reflection, the framework maps emotional states to intents, markedly enhancing both response empathy and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ReflectDiffu outperforms existing models regarding relevance, controllability, and informativeness, achieving state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluations.

  Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, yet they often struggle with visual arithmetic, seemingly simple capabilities like object counting or length comparison, which are essential for relevant complex tasks like chart understanding and geometric reasoning. In this work, we first investigate the root causes of this deficiency through a suite of probing tasks focusing on basic visual arithmetic. Our analysis reveals that while pre-trained vision encoders typically capture sufficient information, the text decoder often fails to decode it correctly for arithmetic reasoning. To address this, we propose CogAlign, a novel post-training strategy inspired by Piaget's theory of cognitive development. CogAlign trains VLMs to recognize invariant properties under visual transformations. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the performance of three diverse VLMs on our proposed probing tasks. Furthermore, CogAlign enhances performance by an average of 4.6% on CHOCOLATE and 2.9% on MATH-VISION, outperforming or matching supervised fine-tuning methods while requiring only 60% less training data. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of CogAlign in improving fundamental visual arithmetic capabilities and their transfer to downstream tasks.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable progress across domains, yet their capabilities in the humanities, particularly history, remain underexplored. Historical reasoning poses unique challenges for AI, involving multimodal source interpretation, temporal inference, and cross-linguistic analysis. While general-purpose agents perform well on many existing benchmarks, they lack the domain-specific expertise required to engage with historical materials and questions. To address this gap, we introduce HistBench, a new benchmark of 414 high-quality questions designed to evaluate AI's capacity for historical reasoning and authored by more than 40 expert contributors. The tasks span a wide range of historical problems-from factual retrieval based on primary sources to interpretive analysis of manuscripts and images, to interdisciplinary challenges involving archaeology, linguistics, or cultural history. Furthermore, the benchmark dataset spans 29 ancient and modern languages and covers a wide range of historical periods and world regions. Finding the poor performance of LLMs and other agents on HistBench, we further present HistAgent, a history-specific agent equipped with carefully designed tools for OCR, translation, archival search, and image understanding in History. On HistBench, HistAgent based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of 27.54% pass@1 and 36.47% pass@2, significantly outperforming LLMs with online search and generalist agents, including GPT-4o (18.60%), DeepSeek-R1(14.49%) and Open Deep Research-smolagents(20.29% pass@1 and 25.12% pass@2). These results highlight the limitations of existing LLMs and generalist agents and demonstrate the advantages of HistAgent for historical reasoning.

  Reasoning-based language models have demonstrated strong performance across various domains, with the most notable gains seen in mathematical and coding tasks. Recent research has shown that reasoning also offers significant benefits for LLM safety and guardrail applications. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of training reasoning-based guardrail models for content moderation, with an emphasis on generalization to custom safety policies at inference time. Our study focuses on two key dimensions: data efficiency and inference efficiency. On the data front, we find that reasoning-based models exhibit strong sample efficiency, achieving competitive performance with significantly fewer training examples than their non-reasoning counterparts. This unlocks the potential to repurpose the remaining data for mining high-value, difficult samples that further enhance model performance. On the inference side, we evaluate practical trade-offs by introducing reasoning budgets, examining the impact of reasoning length on latency and accuracy, and exploring dual-mode training to allow runtime control over reasoning behavior. Our findings will provide practical insights for researchers and developers to effectively and efficiently train and deploy reasoning-based guardrails models in real-world systems.

  Planning represents a fundamental capability of intelligent agents, requiring comprehensive environmental understanding, rigorous logical reasoning, and effective sequential decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on certain planning tasks, their broader application in this domain warrants systematic investigation. This paper presents a comprehensive review of LLM-based planning. Specifically, this survey is structured as follows: First, we establish the theoretical foundations by introducing essential definitions and categories about automated planning. Next, we provide a detailed taxonomy and analysis of contemporary LLM-based planning methodologies, categorizing them into three principal approaches: 1) External Module Augmented Methods that combine LLMs with additional components for planning, 2) Finetuning-based Methods that involve using trajectory data and feedback signals to adjust LLMs in order to improve their planning abilities, and 3) Searching-based Methods that break down complex tasks into simpler components, navigate the planning space, or enhance decoding strategies to find the best solutions. Subsequently, we systematically summarize existing evaluation frameworks, including benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics and performance comparisons between representative planning methods. Finally, we discuss the underlying mechanisms enabling LLM-based planning and outline promising research directions for this rapidly evolving field.

  Recent advances such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek R1 have demonstrated the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). While open-source replication efforts have primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, methods and resources for developing general reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. This gap is partly due to the challenge of collecting diverse and verifiable reasoning data suitable for RL. We hypothesize that logical reasoning is critical for developing general reasoning capabilities, as logic forms a fundamental building block of reasoning. In this work, we present SynLogic, a data synthesis framework and dataset that generates diverse logical reasoning data at scale, encompassing 35 diverse logical reasoning tasks. The SynLogic approach enables controlled synthesis of data with adjustable difficulty and quantity. Importantly, all examples can be verified by simple rules, making them ideally suited for RL with verifiable rewards. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of RL training on the SynLogic dataset based on 7B and 32B models. SynLogic leads to state-of-the-art logical reasoning performance among open-source datasets, surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B by 6 points on BBEH. Furthermore, mixing SynLogic data with mathematical and coding tasks improves the training efficiency of these domains and significantly enhances reasoning generalization. Notably, our mixed training model outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks. These findings position SynLogic as a valuable resource for advancing the broader reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We open-source both the data synthesis pipeline and the SynLogic dataset atthis https URL.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) become deeply integrated into human life and increasingly influence decision-making, it's crucial to evaluate whether and to what extent they exhibit subjective preferences, opinions, and beliefs. These tendencies may stem from biases within the models, which may shape their behavior, influence the advice and recommendations they offer to users, and potentially reinforce certain viewpoints. This paper presents the Preference, Opinion, and Belief survey (POBs), a benchmark developed to assess LLMs' subjective inclinations across societal, cultural, ethical, and personal domains. We applied our benchmark to evaluate leading open- and closed-source LLMs, measuring desired properties such as reliability, neutrality, and consistency. In addition, we investigated the effect of increasing the test-time compute, through reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms, on those metrics. While effective in other tasks, our results show that these mechanisms offer only limited gains in our domain. Furthermore, we reveal that newer model versions are becoming less consistent and more biased toward specific viewpoints, highlighting a blind spot and a concerning trend. POBS:this https URL

  Reasoning with tabular data holds increasing importance in modern applications, yet comprehensive evaluation methodologies for reasoning-intensive Table Question Answering (QA) tasks remain nascent. Existing research is constrained by two primary bottlenecks: 1) Reliance on costly manually annotated real-world data, which is difficult to cover complex reasoning scenarios; 2) The heterogeneity of table structures hinders systematic analysis of the intrinsic mechanisms behind the underperformance of LLMs, especially in reasoning-intensive tasks. To address these issues, we propose an automated generation pipeline AutoT2T that transforms mathematical word problems into table-based reasoning tasks, eliminating the need for manual annotation. The pipeline can generate multiple variants of a table for the same reasoning problem, including noisy versions to support robustness evaluation. Based on this, we construct a new benchmark TabularGSM, which systematically spans a range of table complexities and trap problems. Experimental analyses through AutoT2T and TabularGSM reveal that the tight coupling between reasoning and retrieval or identification processes is a key factor underlying the failure of LLMs in complex Table QA tasks. This highlights the necessity for models to develop synergistic reasoning capabilities in order to perform effectively in complex Table QA tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) falter in multi-step interactions -- often hallucinating, repeating actions, or misinterpreting user corrections -- due to reliance on linear, unstructured context. This fragility stems from the lack of persistent memory to track evolving goals and task dependencies, undermining trust in autonomous agents. We introduce the Task Memory Engine (TME), a modular memory controller that transforms existing LLMs into robust, revision-aware agents without fine-tuning. TME implements a spatial memory framework that replaces flat context with graph-based structures to support consistent, multi-turn reasoning. Departing from linear concatenation and ReAct-style prompting, TME builds a dynamic task graph -- either a tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG) -- to map user inputs to subtasks, align them with prior context, and enable dependency-tracked revisions. Its Task Representation and Intent Management (TRIM) component models task semantics and user intent to ensure accurate interpretation. Across four multi-turn scenarios-trip planning, cooking, meeting scheduling, and shopping cart editing -- TME eliminates 100% of hallucinations and misinterpretations in three tasks, and reduces hallucinations by 66.7% and misinterpretations by 83.3% across 27 user turns, outperforming ReAct. TME's modular design supports plug-and-play deployment and domain-specific customization, adaptable to both personal assistants and enterprise automation. We release TME's codebase, benchmarks, and components as open-source resources, enabling researchers to develop reliable LLM agents. TME's scalable architecture addresses a critical gap in agent performance across complex, interactive settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advancements of Large language models (LLMs) have provided great opportunities to text-to-SQL tasks to overcome the main challenges to understand complex domain information and complex database structures in business applications. In this paper, we propose a meta-aware learning framework to integrate domain knowledge, database schema, chain-of-thought reasoning processes, and metadata relationships to improve the SQL generation quality. The proposed framework includes four learning strategies: schema-based learning, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) learning, knowledge-enhanced learning, and key information tokenization. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of database structure and metadata information towards LLM through fine-tuning to improve its performance on SQL generation within business domains. Through two experimental studies, we have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed methods in execution accuracy, multi-task SQL generation capability, and reduction of catastrophic forgetting.

  Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong performance in structured domains such as mathematics and programming; however, they often lack pedagogical coherence and realistic teaching behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce Pedagogy-R1, a framework that adapts LRMs for classroom use through three innovations: (1) a distillation-based pipeline that filters and refines model outputs for instruction-tuning, (2) the Well-balanced Educational Benchmark (WBEB), which evaluates performance across subject knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, tracing, essay scoring, and teacher decision-making, and (3) a Chain-of-Pedagogy (CoP) prompting strategy for generating and eliciting teacher-style reasoning. Our mixed-method evaluation combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, providing the first systematic assessment of LRMs' pedagogical strengths and limitations.

  Designing effective reasoning-capable LLMs typically requires training using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) or distillation with carefully curated Long Chain of Thoughts (CoT), both of which depend heavily on extensive training data. This creates a major challenge when the amount of quality training data is scarce. We propose a sample-efficient, two-stage training strategy to develop reasoning LLMs under limited supervision. In the first stage, we "warm up" the model by distilling Long CoTs from a toy domain, namely, Knights \& Knaves (K\&K) logic puzzles to acquire general reasoning skills. In the second stage, we apply RLVR to the warmed-up model using a limited set of target-domain examples. Our experiments demonstrate that this two-phase approach offers several benefits: $(i)$ the warmup phase alone facilitates generalized reasoning, leading to performance improvements across a range of tasks, including MATH, HumanEval$^{+}$, and MMLU-Pro; $(ii)$ When both the base model and the warmed-up model are RLVR trained on the same small dataset ($\leq100$ examples), the warmed-up model consistently outperforms the base model; $(iii)$ Warming up before RLVR training allows a model to maintain cross-domain generalizability even after training on a specific domain; $(iv)$ Introducing warmup in the pipeline improves not only accuracy but also overall sample efficiency during RLVR training. The results in this paper highlight the promise of warmup for building robust reasoning LLMs in data-scarce environments.

  Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are digital records of patient information, often containing unstructured clinical text. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is essential in EHRs for extracting key medical entities like problems, tests, and treatments to support downstream clinical applications. This paper explores prompt-based medical entity recognition using large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, guided by various prompt engineering techniques, including zero-shot, few-shot, and an ensemble approach. Among all strategies, GPT-4o with prompt ensemble achieved the highest classification performance with an F1-score of 0.95 and recall of 0.98, outperforming DeepSeek-R1 on the task. The ensemble method improved reliability by aggregating outputs through embedding-based similarity and majority voting.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities and are receiving increasing attention to enhance their reasoning through scaling test--time compute. However, their application in open--ended, knowledge--intensive, complex reasoning scenarios is still limited. Reasoning--oriented methods struggle to generalize to open--ended scenarios due to implicit assumptions of complete world knowledge. Meanwhile, knowledge--augmented reasoning (KAR) methods fail to address two core challenges: 1) error propagation, where errors in early steps cascade through the chain, and 2) verification bottleneck, where the explore--exploit tradeoff arises in multi--branch decision processes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ARise, a novel framework that integrates risk assessment of intermediate reasoning states with dynamic retrieval--augmented generation (RAG) within a Monte Carlo tree search paradigm. This approach enables effective construction and optimization of reasoning plans across multiple maintained hypothesis branches. Experimental results show that ARise significantly outperforms the state--of--the--art KAR methods by up to 23.10%, and the latest RAG-equipped large reasoning models by up to 25.37%.

  The integration of tool learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) has expanded their capabilities in handling complex tasks by leveraging external tools. However, existing benchmarks for tool learning inadequately address critical real-world personalized scenarios, particularly those requiring multi-hop reasoning and inductive knowledge adaptation in dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce FamilyTool, a novel benchmark grounded in a family-based knowledge graph (KG) that simulates personalized, multi-hop tool use scenarios. FamilyTool, including base and extended datasets, challenges LLMs with queries spanning from 1 to 4 relational hops (e.g., inferring familial connections and preferences) and 2 to 6 hops respectively, and incorporates an inductive KG setting where models must adapt to unseen user preferences and relationships without re-training, a common limitation in prior approaches that compromises generalization. We further propose KGETool: a simple KG-augmented evaluation pipeline to systematically assess LLMs' tool use ability in these settings. Experiments reveal significant performance gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, with accuracy dropping sharply as hop complexity increases and inductive scenarios exposing severe generalization deficits. These findings underscore the limitations of current LLMs in handling personalized, evolving real-world contexts and highlight the urgent need for advancements in tool-learning frameworks. FamilyTool serves as a critical resource for evaluating and advancing LLM agents' reasoning, adaptability, and scalability in complex, dynamic environments.

  Diversity in demonstration selection is critical for enhancing model generalization by enabling broader coverage of structures and concepts. Constructing appropriate demonstration sets remains a key research challenge. This paper introduces the Relevance-Diversity Enhanced Selection (RDES), an innovative approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks to optimize the selection of diverse reference demonstrations for tasks amenable to in-context learning (ICL), particularly text classification and reasoning, in few-shot prompting scenarios. RDES employs frameworks like Q-learning and a PPO-based variant to dynamically identify demonstrations that maximize both diversity (quantified by label distribution) and relevance to the task objective. This strategy ensures a balanced representation of reference data, leading to improved accuracy and generalization. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, including diverse reasoning tasks, and involving 14 closed-source and open-source LLMs, we demonstrate that RDES significantly enhances performance compared to ten established baselines. Our evaluation includes analysis of performance across varying numbers of demonstrations on selected datasets. Furthermore, we investigate incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, which further boosts predictive performance. The results highlight the potential of RL for adaptive demonstration selection and addressing challenges in ICL.

  LLMs exhibit advanced reasoning capabilities, offering the potential to transform natural language questions into mathematical models. However, existing open-source datasets in operations research domain lack detailed annotations of the modeling process, such as variable definitions, focusing solely on objective values, which hinders reinforcement learning applications. To address this, we release the StructuredOR dataset, annotated with comprehensive labels that capture the complete mathematical modeling process. We further propose BPP-Search, an algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning into a tree-of-thought structure using Beam search, a Process reward model, and a pairwise Preference algorithm. This approach enables efficient exploration of tree structures, avoiding exhaustive search while improving accuracy. Extensive experiments on StructuredOR, NL4OPT, and MAMO-ComplexLP datasets show that BPP-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In tree-based reasoning, BPP-Search excels in accuracy and efficiency, enabling faster retrieval of correct solutions.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to autonomously perform complex, open-ended tasks. However, many existing frameworks depend heavily on manually predefined tools and workflows, which hinder their adaptability, scalability, and generalization across domains. In this work, we introduce Alita--a generalist agent designed with the principle of "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication," enabling scalable agentic reasoning through minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution. For minimal predefinition, Alita is equipped with only one component for direct problem-solving, making it much simpler and neater than previous approaches that relied heavily on hand-crafted, elaborate tools and workflows. This clean design enhances its potential to generalize to challenging questions, without being limited by tools. For Maximal self-evolution, we enable the creativity of Alita by providing a suite of general-purpose components to autonomously construct, refine, and reuse external capabilities by generating task-related model context protocols (MCPs) from open source, which contributes to scalable agentic reasoning. Notably, Alita achieves 75.15% pass@1 and 87.27% pass@3 accuracy, which is top-ranking among general-purpose agents, on the GAIA benchmark validation dataset, 74.00% and 52.00% pass@1, respectively, on Mathvista and PathVQA, outperforming many agent systems with far greater complexity.

  Solving algebraic word problems (AWPs) has recently emerged as an important natural language processing task. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful mathematical capabilities, and the Chain-of-Thought technique, which guides LLMs through step-by-step reasoning, has yielded impressive results. However, this reasoning ability is limited by the computational weaknesses of LLMs themselves, where calculation errors can accumulate, leading to incorrect final answers. To address this, we propose Program of Equations Thoughts (POET), which transforms the task of generating step-by-step reasoning answers into a two-stage task of predicting equations and generating code, offloading complex computations to a Python interpreter to avoid calculation errors in LLMs. Furthermore, we propose Zero-shot POET, which utilizes a manually designed template to enable LLMs to directly generate Python code for one-step solving. Our method achieves accuracies of 95.3% and 98.0% on the PEN and ALG514 datasets, respectively, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Zero-shot POET also achieves the SOTA result of 95.5% on the DRAW-1K dataset.

  Spatial Planning is a crucial part in the field of spatial intelligence, which requires the understanding and planning about object arrangements in space perspective. AI agents with the spatial planning ability can better adapt to various real-world applications, including robotic manipulation, automatic assembly, urban planning etc. Recent works have attempted to construct benchmarks for evaluating the spatial intelligence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial reasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers from the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task execution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive benchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability of open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild requires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on the given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial planning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data collection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates spatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial understanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on MineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based agents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their spatial planning abilities. We believe our MineAnyBuild will open new avenues for the evaluation of spatial intelligence and help promote further development for open-world AI agents capable of spatial planning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision making in embodied agents, yet existing safety evaluations often rely on coarse success rates and domain-specific setups, making it difficult to diagnose why and where these models fail. This obscures our understanding of embodied safety and limits the selective deployment of LLMs in high-risk physical environments. We introduce SAFEL, the framework for systematically evaluating the physical safety of LLMs in embodied decision making. SAFEL assesses two key competencies: (1) rejecting unsafe commands via the Command Refusal Test, and (2) generating safe and executable plans via the Plan Safety Test. Critically, the latter is decomposed into functional modules, goal interpretation, transition modeling, action sequencing, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of safety failures. To support this framework, we introduce EMBODYGUARD, a PDDL-grounded benchmark containing 942 LLM-generated scenarios covering both overtly malicious and contextually hazardous instructions. Evaluation across 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that while models often reject clearly unsafe commands, they struggle to anticipate and mitigate subtle, situational risks. Our results highlight critical limitations in current LLMs and provide a foundation for more targeted, modular improvements in safe embodied reasoning.

  Temporal reasoning and planning are essential capabilities for large language models (LLMs), yet most existing benchmarks evaluate them in isolation and under limited forms of complexity. To address this gap, we introduce the Temporal Constraint-based Planning (TCP) benchmark, that jointly assesses both capabilities. Each instance in TCP features a naturalistic dialogue around a collaborative project, where diverse and interdependent temporal constraints are explicitly or implicitly expressed, and models must infer an optimal schedule that satisfies all constraints. To construct TCP, we first generate abstract problem prototypes that are paired with realistic scenarios from various domains and enriched into dialogues using an LLM. A human quality check is performed on a sampled subset to confirm the reliability of our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and find that even the strongest models struggle with TCP, highlighting its difficulty and revealing limitations in LLMs' temporal constraint-based planning abilities. We analyze underlying failure cases, open source our benchmark, and hope our findings can inspire future research.

  _Shuang Ao, Flora D. Salim, Simon Khan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although LLMs demonstrate proficiency in several text-based reasoning and planning tasks, their implementation in robotics control is constrained by significant deficiencies: (1) LLM agents are designed to work mainly with textual inputs rather than visual conditions; (2) Current multimodal agents treat LLMs as static planners, which separates their reasoning from environment dynamics, resulting in actions that do not take domain-specific knowledge into account; and (3) LLMs are not designed to learn from visual interactions, which makes it harder for them to make better policies for specific domains. In this paper, we introduce EMAC+, an Embodied Multimodal Agent that collaboratively integrates LLM and VLM via a bidirectional training paradigm. Unlike existing methods, EMAC+ dynamically refines high-level textual plans generated by an LLM using real-time feedback from a VLM executing low-level visual control tasks. We address critical limitations of previous models by enabling the LLM to internalize visual environment dynamics directly through interactive experience, rather than relying solely on static symbolic mappings. Extensive experimental evaluations on ALFWorld and RT-1 benchmarks demonstrate that EMAC+ achieves superior task performance, robustness against noisy observations, and efficient learning. We also conduct thorough ablation studies and provide detailed analyses of success and failure cases.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are criticized for the excessively lengthy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to derive the final answer, suffering from high first-token and overall latency. Typically, the CoT of LRMs mixes multiple thinking units; each unit attempts to produce a candidate answer to the original query. Hence, a natural idea to improve efficiency is to reduce the unit number. Yet, the fact that the thinking units in vanilla CoT cannot be explicitly managed renders doing so challenging. This paper introduces Multi-Turn Decomposition (MinD) to decode conventional CoT into a sequence of explicit, structured, and turn-wise interactions to bridge the gap. In MinD, the model provides a multi-turn response to the query, where each turn embraces a thinking unit and yields a corresponding answer. The subsequent turns can reflect, verify, revise, or explore alternative approaches to both the thinking and answer parts of earlier ones. This not only makes the answer delivered more swiftly, but also enables explicit controls over the iterative reasoning process (i.e., users may halt or continue at any turn). We follow a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) then reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm to realize MinD. We first rephrase the outputs of an LRM into multi-turn formats by prompting another LLM, and then tune the LRM with such data. Observing that the tuned model tends to consume even more tokens than the original one (probably due to that the multi-turn formats introduce additional answer tokens), we advocate leveraging RL algorithms like GRPO to prioritize correct outputs with fewer turns. Trained on the MATH dataset using R1-Distill models, MinD can achieve up to ~70% reduction in both output token usage and time to first token (TTFT), while maintaining competitive performance on reasoning benchmarks such as MATH-500, AIME24, AMC23, and GPQA-Diamond.

  While showing sophisticated reasoning abilities, large language models (LLMs) still struggle with long-horizon decision-making tasks due to deficient exploration and long-term credit assignment, especially in sparse-reward scenarios. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer principle, we propose an innovative framework **GLIDER** (**G**rounding **L**anguage Models as Eff**I**cient **D**ecision-Making Agents via Offline Hi**E**rarchical **R**einforcement Learning) that introduces a parameter-efficient and generally applicable hierarchy to LLM policies. We develop a scheme where the low-level controller is supervised with abstract, step-by-step plans that are learned and instructed by the high-level policy. This design decomposes complicated problems into a series of coherent chain-of-thought reasoning sub-tasks, providing flexible temporal abstraction to significantly enhance exploration and learning for long-horizon tasks. Furthermore, GLIDER facilitates fast online adaptation to non-stationary environments owing to the strong transferability of its task-agnostic low-level skills. Experiments on ScienceWorld and ALFWorld benchmarks show that GLIDER achieves consistent performance gains, along with enhanced generalization capabilities.

  Empirical methods to examine the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to use Automated Theorem Prover (ATP) reasoning strategies are studied. We evaluate the performance of State of the Art models from December 2023 and August 2024 on PRONTOQA steamroller reasoning problems. For that, we develop methods for assessing LLM response accuracy and correct answer correlation.Our results show that progress in improving LLM reasoning abilities has stalled over the nine month period. By tracking completion tokens, we show that almost all improvement in reasoning ability since GPT-4 was released can be attributed to either hidden system prompts or the training of models to automatically use generic Chain of Thought prompting strategies. Among the ATP reasoning strategies tried, we found that current frontier LLMs are best able to follow the bottom-up (also known as forward-chaining) strategy. A low positive correlation was found between an LLM response containing correct reasoning and arriving at the correct conclusion.

  While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable reward, whether large vision-language models (VLMs) can directly inherit such capabilities through similar post-training strategies remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic compositional probing study to evaluate whether current VLMs trained with RL or other post-training strategies can compose capabilities across modalities or tasks under out-of-distribution conditions. We design a suite of diagnostic tasks that train models on unimodal tasks or isolated reasoning skills, and evaluate them on multimodal, compositional variants requiring skill integration. Through comparisons between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL-trained models, we identify three key findings: (1) RL-trained models consistently outperform SFT on compositional generalization, demonstrating better integration of learned skills; (2) although VLMs achieve strong performance on individual tasks, they struggle to generalize compositionally under cross-modal and cross-task scenario, revealing a significant gap in current training strategies; (3) enforcing models to explicitly describe visual content before reasoning (e.g., caption-before-thinking), along with rewarding progressive vision-to-text grounding, yields notable gains. It highlights two essential ingredients for improving compositionality in VLMs: visual-to-text alignment and accurate visual grounding. Our findings shed light on the current limitations of RL-based reasoning VLM training and provide actionable insights toward building models that reason compositionally across modalities and tasks.

  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance on factual recall and general reasoning but struggle to adapt to user-specific, commonsense knowledge, a challenge particularly acute in small-parameter settings where computational efficiency is prioritized. We introduce CaseEdit, a new dataset and generation pipeline for evaluating localized, personalized commonsense knowledge editing in small LLMs to address this. Built upon the ATOMIC20/20 commonsense graph, CaseEdit uses a multi-stage inference process to generate both typical and atypical contextual edits for household objects, paired with targeted evaluation questions across four axes: reliability, generalization, locality, and portability. We evaluate established knowledge editing methods using CaseEdit and demonstrate that AlphaEdit, a technique employing null-space projection to minimize interference with unrelated knowledge, consistently outperforms other methods when applied to an LLaMA 3.2 3B model, even in scalability tests, showing minimal ripple effects. Our results indicate that using CaseEdit with effective editing techniques like AlphaEdit allows small models to internalize high-quality, context-sensitive common-sense knowledge, paving the way for lightweight, personalized assistants.

  Recent advances in reinforcement learning with verifiable, rule-based rewards have greatly enhanced the reasoning capabilities and out-of-distribution generalization of VLMs/LLMs, obviating the need for manually crafted reasoning chains. Despite these promising developments in the general domain, their translation to medical imaging remains limited. Current medical reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) methods predominantly focus on close-ended VQA, thereby restricting the model's ability to engage in world knowledge retrieval and flexible task adaptation. More critically, these methods fall short of addressing the critical clinical demand for open-ended, reasoning-intensive decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MedCCO}, the first multimodal reinforcement learning framework tailored for medical VQA that unifies close-ended and open-ended data within a curriculum-driven RFT paradigm. Specifically, MedCCO is initially fine-tuned on a diverse set of close-ended medical VQA tasks to establish domain-grounded reasoning capabilities, and is then progressively adapted to open-ended tasks to foster deeper knowledge enhancement and clinical interpretability. We validate MedCCO across eight challenging medical VQA benchmarks, spanning both close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results show that MedCCO consistently enhances performance and generalization, achieving a 11.4\% accuracy gain across three in-domain tasks, and a 5.7\% improvement on five out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings highlight the promise of curriculum-guided RL in advancing robust, clinically-relevant reasoning in medical multimodal language models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Role-based access control (RBAC) and hierarchical structures are foundational to how information flows and decisions are made within virtually all organizations. As the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as unified knowledge repositories and intelligent assistants in enterprise settings becomes increasingly apparent, a critical, yet under explored, challenge emerges: \textit{can these models reliably understand and operate within the complex, often nuanced, constraints imposed by organizational hierarchies and associated permissions?} Evaluating this crucial capability is inherently difficult due to the proprietary and sensitive nature of real-world corporate data and access control policies. We introduce a synthetic yet representative \textbf{OrgAccess} benchmark consisting of 40 distinct types of permissions commonly relevant across different organizational roles and levels. We further create three types of permissions: 40,000 easy (1 permission), 10,000 medium (3-permissions tuple), and 20,000 hard (5-permissions tuple) to test LLMs' ability to accurately assess these permissions and generate responses that strictly adhere to the specified hierarchical rules, particularly in scenarios involving users with overlapping or conflicting permissions. Our findings reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle significantly to maintain compliance with role-based structures, even with explicit instructions, with their performance degrades further when navigating interactions involving two or more conflicting permissions. Specifically, even \textbf{GPT-4.1 only achieves an F1-Score of 0.27 on our hardest benchmark}. This demonstrates a critical limitation in LLMs' complex rule following and compositional reasoning capabilities beyond standard factual or STEM-based benchmarks, opening up a new paradigm for evaluating their fitness for practical, structured environments.

  We present SeePhys, a large-scale multimodal benchmark for LLM reasoning grounded in physics questions ranging from middle school to PhD qualifying exams. The benchmark covers 7 fundamental domains spanning the physics discipline, incorporating 21 categories of highly heterogeneous diagrams. In contrast to prior works where visual elements mainly serve auxiliary purposes, our benchmark features a substantial proportion of vision-essential problems (75\%) that mandate visual information extraction for correct solutions. Through extensive evaluation, we observe that even the most advanced visual reasoning models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-pro and o4-mini) achieve sub-60\% accuracy on our benchmark. These results reveal fundamental challenges in current large language models' visual understanding capabilities, particularly in: (i) establishing rigorous coupling between diagram interpretation and physics reasoning, and (ii) overcoming their persistent reliance on textual cues as cognitive shortcuts.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks, sparking growing interest in their application to preference reasoning in recommendation systems. Existing methods typically rely on fine-tuning with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) data. However, these methods face significant practical limitations due to (1) the difficulty of obtaining high-quality CoT data in recommendation and (2) the high inference latency caused by generating CoT reasoning. In this work, we explore an alternative approach that shifts from explicit CoT reasoning to compact, information-dense latent reasoning. This approach eliminates the need for explicit CoT generation and improves inference efficiency, as a small set of latent tokens can effectively capture the entire reasoning process. Building on this idea, we propose $\textit{\underline{R}einforced \underline{Latent} \underline{R}easoning for \underline{R}ecommendation}$ (LatentR$^3$), a novel end-to-end training framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize latent reasoning without relying on any CoTthis http URL$^3$ adopts a two-stage training strategy: first, supervised fine-tuning to initialize the latent reasoning module, followed by pure RL training to encourage exploration through a rule-based reward design. Our RL implementation is based on a modified GRPO algorithm, which reduces computational overhead during training and introduces continuous reward signals for more efficient learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LatentR$^3$ enables effective latent reasoning without any direct supervision of the reasoning process, significantly improving performance when integrated with different LLM-based recommendation methods.

  Modern large language models rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to achieve impressive performance, yet the same mechanism can amplify deceptive alignment, situations in which a model appears aligned while covertly pursuing misaligned goals. Existing safety pipelines treat deception as a black-box output to be filtered post-hoc, leaving the model free to scheme during its internal reasoning. We ask: Can deception be intercepted while the model is thinking? We answer this question, the first framework that embeds a Self-Monitor inside the CoT process itself, named CoT Monitor+. During generation, the model produces (i) ordinary reasoning steps and (ii) an internal self-evaluation signal trained to flag and suppress misaligned strategies. The signal is used as an auxiliary reward in reinforcement learning, creating a feedback loop that rewards honest reasoning and discourages hidden goals. To study deceptive alignment systematically, we introduce DeceptionBench, a five-category benchmark that probes covert alignment-faking, sycophancy, etc. We evaluate various LLMs and show that unrestricted CoT roughly aggravates the deceptive tendency. In contrast, CoT Monitor+ cuts deceptive behaviors by 43.8% on average while preserving task accuracy. Further, when the self-monitor signal replaces an external weak judge in RL fine-tuning, models exhibit substantially fewer obfuscated thoughts and retain transparency.

  The powerful reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mathematics and coding, combined with their ability to automate complex tasks through agentic frameworks, present unprecedented opportunities for accelerating scientific innovation. In this paper, we introduce AI-Researcher, a fully autonomous research system that transforms how AI-driven scientific discovery is conducted and evaluated. Our framework seamlessly orchestrates the complete research pipeline--from literature review and hypothesis generation to algorithm implementation and publication-ready manuscript preparation--with minimal human intervention. To rigorously assess autonomous research capabilities, we develop Scientist-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising state-of-the-art papers across diverse AI research domains, featuring both guided innovation and open-ended exploration tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AI-Researcher achieves remarkable implementation success rates and produces research papers that approach human-level quality. This work establishes new foundations for autonomous scientific innovation that can complement human researchers by systematically exploring solution spaces beyond cognitive limitations.

  _Jonathan Leung, Yongjie Wang, Zhiqi Shen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general capabilities but often struggle with step-by-step reasoning, especially in complex applications such as games. While retrieval-augmented methods like GraphRAG attempt to bridge this gap through cross-document extraction and indexing, their fragmented entity-relation graphs and overly dense local connectivity hinder the construction of coherent reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on Goal-Oriented Graphs (GoGs), where each node represents a goal and its associated attributes, and edges encode logical dependencies between goals. This structure enables explicit retrieval of reasoning paths by first identifying high-level goals and recursively retrieving their subgoals, forming coherent reasoning chains to guide LLM prompting. Our method significantly enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs in game-playing tasks, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on the Minecraft testbed, outperforming GraphRAG and other baselines.

  Probing techniques have shown promise in revealing how LLMs encode human-interpretable concepts, particularly when applied to curated datasets. However, the factors governing a dataset's suitability for effective probe training are not well-understood. This study hypothesizes that probe performance on such datasets reflects characteristics of both the LLM's generated responses and its internal feature space. Through quantitative analysis of probe performance and LLM response uncertainty across a series of tasks, we find a strong correlation: improved probe performance consistently corresponds to a reduction in response uncertainty, and vice versa. Subsequently, we delve deeper into this correlation through the lens of feature importance analysis. Our findings indicate that high LLM response variance is associated with a larger set of important features, which poses a greater challenge for probe models and often results in diminished performance. Moreover, leveraging the insights from response uncertainty analysis, we are able to identify concrete examples where LLM representations align with human knowledge across diverse domains, offering additional evidence of interpretable reasoning in LLMs.

  Mathematical reasoning lies at the heart of artificial intelligence, underpinning applications in education, program verification, and research-level mathematical discovery. Mathematical competitions, in particular, present two challenging problem types: theorem-proving, requiring rigorous proofs of stated conclusions, and answer-construction, involving hypothesizing and formally verifying mathematical objects. Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively generate creative candidate answers but struggle with formal verification, while symbolic provers ensure rigor but cannot efficiently handle creative conjecture generation. We introduce the Enumerate-Conjecture-Prove (ECP) framework, a modular neuro-symbolic method integrating LLM-based enumeration and pattern-driven conjecturing with formal theorem proving. We present ConstructiveBench, a dataset of 3,431 answer-construction problems in various math competitions with verified Lean formalizations. On the ConstructiveBench dataset, ECP improves the accuracy of answer construction from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline of 14.54% to 45.06% with the gpt-4.1-mini model. Moreover, combining with ECP's constructed answers, the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B model generates correct proofs for 858 of the 3,431 constructive problems in Lean, achieving 25.01% accuracy, compared to 9.86% for symbolic-only baselines.

  Various industries have produced a large number of documents such as industrial plans, technical guidelines, and regulations that are structurally complex and content-wise fragmented. This poses significant challenges for experts and decision-makers in terms of retrieval and understanding. Although existing LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods can provide context-related suggestions, they lack quantitative weighting and traceable reasoning paths, making it difficult to offer multi-level and transparent decision support. To address this issue, this paper proposes the RAD method, which integrates Multi-Criteria Decision Making with the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs. The method automatically extracts key criteria from industry documents, builds a weighted hierarchical decision model, and generates structured reports under model guidance. The RAD framework introduces explicit weight assignment and reasoning chains in decision generation to ensure accuracy, completeness, and traceability. Experiments show that in various decision-making tasks, the decision reports generated by RAD significantly outperform existing methods in terms of detail, rationality, and structure, demonstrating its application value and potential in complex decision support scenarios.

  The recent DeepSeek-R1 has showcased the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards. Despite its success in language models, its application in multi-modal domains, particularly in graphic user interface (GUI) agent tasks, remains under-explored. To address this issue, we propose UI-R1, the first framework to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI action prediction tasks. Specifically, UI-R1 introduces a novel rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). For efficient training, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed UI-R1-3B achieves significant improvements over the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks, with average accuracy gains of 22.1% on ScreenSpot, 6.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, and 12.7% on ANDROIDCONTROL. Furthermore, UI-R1-3B delivers competitive performance compared to larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B) trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K samples. We additionally develop an optimized version, UI-R1-E-3B, which significantly improves both grounding efficiency and accuracy. These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain. Code website:this https URL.

  Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising capabilities in interpreting visualized graph data, offering a new perspective for graph-structured reasoning beyond traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, existing studies focus primarily on single-graph reasoning, leaving the critical challenge of multi-graph joint reasoning underexplored. In this work, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance the multi-graph reasoning abilities of VLMs. Our benchmark covers four common graph types-knowledge graphs, flowcharts, mind maps, and route maps-and supports both homogeneous and heterogeneous graph groupings with tasks of increasing complexity. We evaluate several state-of-the-art VLMs under a multi-dimensional scoring framework that assesses graph parsing, reasoning consistency, and instruction-following accuracy. Additionally, we fine-tune multiple open-source models and observe consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of our dataset. This work provides a principled step toward advancing multi-graph understanding and reveals new opportunities for cross-modal graph intelligence.

  Large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities across various domains, especially mathematics and logic reasoning. However, current evaluations overlook physics-based reasoning - a complex task requiring physics theorems and constraints. We present PhysReason, a 1,200-problem benchmark comprising knowledge-based (25%) and reasoning-based (75%) problems, where the latter are divided into three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard). Notably, problems require an average of 8.1 solution steps, with hard requiring 15.6, reflecting the complexity of physics-based reasoning. We propose the Physics Solution Auto Scoring Framework, incorporating efficient answer-level and comprehensive step-level evaluations. Top-performing models like Deepseek-R1, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, and o3-mini-high achieve less than 60% on answer-level evaluation, with performance dropping from knowledge questions (75.11%) to hard problems (31.95%). Through step-level evaluation, we identified four key bottlenecks: Physics Theorem Application, Physics Process Understanding, Calculation, and Physics Condition Analysis. These findings position PhysReason as a novel and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating physics-based reasoning capabilities in large language models.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various complex tasks, yet they still suffer from hallucinations. By incorporating and exploring external knowledge, such as knowledge graphs(KGs), LLM's ability to provide factual answers has been enhanced. This approach carries significant practical implications. However, existing methods suffer from three key limitations: insufficient mining of LLMs' internal knowledge, constrained generation of interpretable reasoning paths, and unclear fusion of internal and external knowledge. Therefore, we propose KnowPath, a knowledge-enhanced large model framework driven by the collaboration of internal and external knowledge. It relies on the internal knowledge of the LLM to guide the exploration of interpretable directed subgraphs in external knowledge graphs, better integrating the two knowledge sources for more accurate reasoning. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of KnowPath. Our code and data are available atthis https URL.
