- **[Assessing the Value of Visual Input: A Benchmark of Multimodal Large Language Models for Robotic Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12391)**  `arXiv:2507.12391`  `cs.RO`  
  _Jacinto Colan, Ana Davila, Yasuhisa Hasegawa_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for enhancing robotic path planning. This paper assesses visual input's utility for multimodal LLMs in such tasks via a comprehensive benchmark. We evaluated 15 multimodal LLMs on generating valid and optimal paths in 2D grid environments, simulating simplified robotic planning, comparing text-only versus text-plus-visual inputs across varying model sizes and grid complexities. Our results indicate moderate success rates on simpler small grids, where visual input or few-shot text prompting offered some benefits. However, performance significantly degraded on larger grids, highlighting a scalability challenge. While larger models generally achieved higher average success, the visual modality was not universally dominant over well-structured text for these multimodal systems, and successful paths on simpler grids were generally of high quality. These results indicate current limitations in robust spatial reasoning, constraint adherence, and scalable multimodal integration, identifying areas for future LLM development in robotic path planning.

- **[STEP Planner: Constructing cross-hierarchical subgoal tree as an embodied long-horizon task planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21030)**  `arXiv:2506.21030`  `cs.RO`  
  _Tianxing Zhou, Zhirui Wang, Haojia Ao, Guangyan Chen, Boyang Xing, Jingwen Cheng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to perform reliable long-horizon task planning is crucial for deploying robots in real-world environments. However, directly employing Large Language Models (LLMs) as action sequence generators often results in low success rates due to their limited reasoning ability for long-horizon embodied tasks. In the STEP framework, we construct a subgoal tree through a pair of closed-loop models: a subgoal decomposition model and a leaf node termination model. Within this framework, we develop a hierarchical tree structure that spans from coarse to fine resolutions. The subgoal decomposition model leverages a foundation LLM to break down complex goals into manageable subgoals, thereby spanning the subgoal tree. The leaf node termination model provides real-time feedback based on environmental states, determining when to terminate the tree spanning and ensuring each leaf node can be directly converted into a primitive action. Experiments conducted in both the VirtualHome WAH-NL benchmark and on real robots demonstrate that STEP achieves long-horizon embodied task completion with success rates up to 34% (WAH-NL) and 25% (real robot) outperforming SOTA methods.

  The data privacy constraint in online continual learning (OCL), where the data can be seen only once, complicates the catastrophic forgetting problem in streaming data. A common approach applied by the current SOTAs in OCL is with the use of memory saving exemplars or features from previous classes to be replayed in the current task. On the other hand, the prompt-based approach performs excellently in continual learning but with the cost of a growing number of trainable parameters. The first approach may not be applicable in practice due to data openness policy, while the second approach has the issue of throughput associated with the streaming data. In this study, we propose a novel prompt-based method for online continual learning that includes 4 main components: (1) single light-weight prompt generator as a general knowledge, (2) trainable scaler-and-shifter as specific knowledge, (3) pre-trained model (PTM) generalization preserving, and (4) hard-soft updates mechanism. Our proposed method achieves significantly higher performance than the current SOTAs in CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB dataset. Our complexity analysis shows that our method requires a relatively smaller number of parameters and achieves moderate training time, inference time, and throughput. For further study, the source code of our method is available atthis https URL.

- **[Learning to Reason at the Frontier of Learnability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12272)**  `arXiv:2502.12272`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Thomas Foster, Jakob Foerster_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning is now widely adopted as the final stage of large language model training, especially for reasoning-style tasks such as maths problems. Typically, models attempt each question many times during a single training step and attempt to learn from their successes and failures. However, we demonstrate that throughout training with two popular algorithms (PPO and VinePPO) on two widely used datasets, many questions are either solved by all attempts - meaning they are already learned - or by none - providing no meaningful training signal. To address this, we adapt a method from the reinforcement learning literature - sampling for learnability - and apply it to the reinforcement learning stage of LLM training. Our curriculum prioritises questions with high variance of success, i.e. those where the agent sometimes succeeds, but not always. Our findings demonstrate that this curriculum consistently boosts training performance across multiple algorithms and datasets, paving the way for more efficient and effective reinforcement learning with LLMs.

- **[GHPO: Adaptive Guidance for Stable and Efficient LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10628)**  `arXiv:2507.10628`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks. However, prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training instability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled learning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning framework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks, effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning baselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning models.

- **[Describe Anything Model for Visual Question Answering on Text-rich Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12441)**  `arXiv:2507.12441`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Yen-Linh Vu, Dinh-Thang Duong, Truong-Binh Duong, Anh-Khoi Nguyen, Thanh-Huy Nguyen, Le Thien Phuc Nguyen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling, particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements. Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[HueManity: Probing Fine-Grained Visual Perception in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03194)**  `arXiv:2506.03194`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.

- **[Seeing the Signs: A Survey of Edge-Deployable OCR Models for Billboard Visibility Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11730)**  `arXiv:2507.11730`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Maciej Szankin, Vidhyananth Venkatasamy, Lihang Ying_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B, InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline (PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and evaluation code publicly.

- **[Improving Lightweight Weed Detection via Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12344)**  `arXiv:2507.12344`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ahmet Oƒüuz Saltƒ±k, Max Voigt, Sourav Modak, Mike Beckworth, Anthony Stein_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Weed detection is a critical component of precision agriculture, facilitating targeted herbicide application and reducing environmental impact. However, deploying accurate object detection models on resource-limited platforms remains challenging, particularly when differentiating visually similar weed species commonly encountered in plant phenotyping applications. In this work, we investigate Channel-wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD) and Masked Generative Distillation (MGD) to enhance the performance of lightweight models for real-time smart spraying systems. Utilizing YOLO11x as the teacher model and YOLO11n as both reference and student, both CWD and MGD effectively transfer knowledge from the teacher to the student model. Our experiments, conducted on a real-world dataset comprising sugar beet crops and four weed types (Cirsium, Convolvulus, Fallopia, and Echinochloa), consistently show increased AP50 across all classes. The distilled CWD student model achieves a notable improvement of 2.5% and MGD achieves 1.9% in mAP50 over the baseline without increasing model complexity. Additionally, we validate real-time deployment feasibility by evaluating the student YOLO11n model on Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi 5 embedded devices, performing five independent runs to evaluate performance stability across random seeds. These findings confirm CWD and MGD as an effective, efficient, and practical approach for improving deep learning-based weed detection accuracy in precision agriculture and plant phenotyping scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly used for content moderation, yet their robustness in short-form video contexts remains underexplored. Current safety evaluations often rely on unimodal attacks, failing to address combined attack vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating the tri-modal safety of MLLMs. First, we present the Short-Video Multimodal Adversarial (SVMA) dataset, comprising diverse short-form videos with human-guided synthetic adversarial attacks. Second, we propose ChimeraBreak, a novel tri-modal attack strategy that simultaneously challenges visual, auditory, and semantic reasoning pathways. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant vulnerabilities with high Attack Success Rates (ASR). Our findings uncover distinct failure modes, showing model biases toward misclassifying benign or policy-violating content. We assess results using LLM-as-a-judge, demonstrating attack reasoning efficacy. Our dataset and findings provide crucial insights for developing more robust and safe MLLMs.

- **[Hyperphantasia: A Benchmark for Evaluating the Mental Visualization Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11932)**  `arXiv:2507.11932`  `cs.CV`  
  _Mohammad Shahab Sepehri, Berk Tinaz, Zalan Fabian, Mahdi Soltanolkotabi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mental visualization, the ability to construct and manipulate visual representations internally, is a core component of human cognition and plays a vital role in tasks involving reasoning, prediction, and abstraction. Despite the rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current benchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insight into the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns to support problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each task is procedurally generated and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns, robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.

- **[From Objects to Events: Unlocking Complex Visual Understanding in Object Detectors via LLM-guided Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05843)**  `arXiv:2502.05843`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yuhui Zeng, Haoxiang Wu, Wenjie Nie, Xiawu Zheng, Guangyao Chen, Yunhang Shen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current object detectors excel at entity localization and classification, yet exhibit inherent limitations in event recognition capabilities. This deficiency arises from their architecture's emphasis on discrete object identification rather than modeling the compositional reasoning, inter-object correlations, and contextual semantics essential for comprehensive event understanding. To address this challenge, we present a novel framework that expands the capability of standard object detectors beyond mere object recognition to complex event understanding through LLM-guided symbolic reasoning. Our key innovation lies in bridging the semantic gap between object detection and event understanding without requiring expensive task-specific training. The proposed plug-and-play framework interfaces with any open-vocabulary detector while extending their inherent capabilities across architectures. At its core, our approach combines (i) a symbolic regression mechanism exploring relationship patterns among detected entities and (ii) a LLM-guided strategically guiding the search toward meaningful expressions. These discovered symbolic rules transform low-level visual perception into interpretable event understanding, providing a transparent reasoning path from objects to events with strong transferability acrossthis http URLcompared our training-free framework against specialized event recognition systems across diverse application domains. Experiments demonstrate that our framework enhances multiple object detector architectures to recognize complex events such as illegal fishing activities (75% AUROC, +8.36% improvement), construction safety violations (+15.77%), and abnormal crowd behaviors (+23.16%).

  Large language models excel in question-answering (QA) yet still struggle with multi-hop reasoning and temporal questions. Query-based knowledge graph QA (KGQA) offers a modular alternative by generating executable queries instead of direct answers. We explore multi-stage query-based framework for WikiData QA, proposing multi-stage approach that enhances performance on challenging multi-hop and temporal benchmarks. Through generalization and rejection studies, we evaluate robustness across multi-hop and temporal QA datasets. Additionally, we introduce a novel entity linking and predicate matching method using CoT reasoning. Our results demonstrate the potential of query-based multi-stage KGQA framework for improving multi-hop and temporal QA with small language models. Code and data:this https URL

- **[Simple Mechanistic Explanations for Out-Of-Context Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08218)**  `arXiv:2507.08218`  `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Atticus Wang, Joshua Engels, Oliver Clive-Griffin, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Neel Nanda_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to their safe and reliable deployment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework. We release our training codebase on open-source data atthis https URL.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then, we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods, datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive, trustworthy, and human-centric. The collection is available atthis https URL.

- **[Web-Browsing LLMs Can Access Social Media Profiles and Infer User Demographics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12372)**  `arXiv:2507.12372`  `cs.CL`  
  _Meysam Alizadeh, Fabrizio Gilardi, Zeynab Samei, Mohsen Mosleh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training data, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots. Recent advancements, however, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time information retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While prior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites, their capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains unexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic attributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic dataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international participants, we show that these models can access social media content and predict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic dataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles, which may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal activity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science in the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information operations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. We recommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing applications, while preserving controlled access for verified research purposes.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents an intervention study on the effects of the combined methods of (1) the Socratic method, (2) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, (3) simplified gamification and (4) formative feedback on university students' Maths learning driven by large language models (LLMs). We call our approach Mathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students struggle with Maths and as a result avoid Math-related discipline or subjects despite the importance of Maths across many fields, including signal processing. Oftentimes, students' Maths difficulties stem from suboptimal pedagogy. We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT) method to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after randomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students. Samples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade School Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH) datasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a manageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were used to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer 4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for capability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the MEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even much better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH dataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult Maths problems.

  _Anthony G Cohn, Robert E Blackwell_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate the abilities of 28 Large language Models (LLMs) to reason about cardinal directions (CDs) using a benchmark generated from a set of templates, extensively testing an LLM's ability to determine the correct CD given a particular scenario. The templates allow for a number of degrees of variation such as means of locomotion of the agent involved, and whether set in the first, second or third person. Even the newer Large Reasoning Models are unable to reliably determine the correct CD for all questions. This paper summarises and extends earlier work presented at COSIT-24.

  _Yanjian Zhang, Guillaume Wisniewski, Nadi Tomeh, Thierry Charnois_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human reasoning involves different strategies, each suited to specific problems. Prior work shows that large language model (LLMs) tend to favor a single reasoning strategy, potentially limiting their effectiveness in diverse reasoning challenges. In this work, we investigate whether prompting can control LLMs reasoning strategies and assess its impact on logical problem-solving. While our experiments show that no single strategy consistently improves accuracy, performance could be enhanced if models could adaptively choose the optimal strategy. We propose methods to guide LLMs in strategy selection, highlighting new ways to refine their reasoning abilities.

  Academic paper review is a critical yet time-consuming task within the research community. With the increasing volume of academic publications, automating the review process has become a significant challenge. The primary issue lies in generating comprehensive, accurate, and reasoning-consistent review comments that align with human reviewers' judgments. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing ReviewAgents, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate academic paper reviews. We first introduce a novel dataset, Review-CoT, consisting of 142k review comments, designed for training LLM agents. This dataset emulates the structured reasoning process of human reviewers-summarizing the paper, referencing relevant works, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and generating a review conclusion. Building upon this, we train LLM reviewer agents capable of structured reasoning using a relevant-paper-aware training method. Furthermore, we construct ReviewAgents, a multi-role, multi-LLM agent review framework, to enhance the review comment generation process. Additionally, we propose ReviewBench, a benchmark for evaluating the review comments generated by LLMs. Our experimental results on ReviewBench demonstrate that while existing LLMs exhibit a certain degree of potential for automating the review process, there remains a gap when compared to human-generated reviews. Moreover, our ReviewAgents framework further narrows this gap, outperforming advanced LLMs in generating review comments.

- **[Rolling the DICE on Idiomaticity: How LLMs Fail to Grasp Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16069)**  `arXiv:2410.16069`  `cs.CL`  
  _Maggie Mi, Aline Villavicencio, Nafise Sadat Moosavi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human processing of idioms relies on understanding the contextual sentences in which idioms occur, as well as language-intrinsic features such as frequency and speaker-intrinsic factors like familiarity. While LLMs have shown high performance on idiomaticity detection tasks, this success may be attributed to reasoning shortcuts in existing datasets. To this end, we construct a novel, controlled contrastive dataset designed to test whether LLMs can effectively use context to disambiguate idiomatic meaning. Additionally, we explore how collocational frequency and sentence probability influence model performance. Our findings reveal that LLMs often fail to resolve idiomaticity when it is required to attend to the surrounding context, and that models perform better on sentences that have higher likelihood. The collocational frequency of expressions also impacts performance. We make our code and dataset publicly available.

  Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts.

  This paper introduces GeoChain, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating step-by-step geographic reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million Q&A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning, and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within MLLMs.

  Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge, human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then, conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld, a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

  Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process that enables logical inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reasoning has emerged as a key capability that distinguishes advanced AI systems from conventional models that empower chatbots. In this survey, we categorize existing methods along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) Regimes, which define the stage at which reasoning is achieved (either at inference time or through dedicated training); and (2) Architectures, which determine the components involved in the reasoning process, distinguishing between standalone LLMs and agentic compound systems that incorporate external tools, and multi-agent collaborations. Within each dimension, we analyze two key perspectives: (1) Input level, which focuses on techniques that construct high-quality prompts that the LLM condition on; and (2) Output level, which methods that refine multiple sampled candidates to enhance reasoning quality. This categorization provides a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape of LLM reasoning, highlighting emerging trends such as the shift from inference-scaling to learning-to-reason (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and the transition to agentic workflows (e.g., OpenAI Deep Research, Manus Agent). Additionally, we cover a broad spectrum of learning algorithms, from supervised fine-tuning to reinforcement learning such as PPO and GRPO, and the training of reasoners and verifiers. We also examine key designs of agentic workflows, from established patterns like generator-evaluator and LLM debate to recent innovations. ...

  Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power, general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an 18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in spatially complex areas.

  Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems. However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation, assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and (3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective foundation for multi-agent collaboration.

  Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental method in operations research, but formulating DP models has traditionally required expert knowledge of both the problem context and DP techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges due to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of training data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing LLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such as linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark covering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic evaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a 7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on hard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel synthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a limited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for diversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key insight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong correctness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such guarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse formulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both approaches and the importance of combining them.

  We introduce a modular harness design for LLM agents that composes of perception, memory, and reasoning components, enabling a single LLM or VLM backbone to tackle a wide spectrum of multi turn gaming environments without domain-specific engineering. Using classic and modern game suites as low-barrier, high-diversity testbeds, our framework provides a unified workflow for analyzing how each module affects performance across dynamic interactive settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the harness lifts gameplay performance consistently over un-harnessed baselines and reveals distinct contribution patterns, for example, memory dominates in long-horizon puzzles while perception is critical in vision noisy arcades. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our modular harness design in advancing general-purpose agent, given the familiarity and ubiquity of games in everyday human experience.

  Reasoning-capable language models achieve state-of-the-art performance in diverse complex tasks by generating long, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. While recent works show that base models can acquire such reasoning traces via reinforcement learning or distillation from stronger models like DeepSeek-R1, previous works demonstrate that even short CoT prompting without fine-tuning is able to improve reasoning. We ask whether long CoT can be induced in a base model using only prompting or minimal tuning. Using just 20 long CoT examples from the reasoning model \texttt{QwQ-32B-Preview}, we lightly fine-tune the base model \texttt{Qwen2.5-32B}. The resulting model outperforms the much larger \texttt{Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct}, showing that a handful of high-quality examples can unlock strong reasoning capabilities. We further explore using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators, enhanced with prompt engineering, multi-pass editing, and structural guidance. However, neither matches the performance of reasoning model traces, suggesting that certain latent qualities of expert CoT are difficult to replicate. We analyze key properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty, diversity, and answer length, that influence reasoning distillation. While challenges remain, we are optimistic that carefully curated human-written CoT, even in small quantities, can activate reasoning behaviors in base models. We release our human-authored dataset across refinement stages and invite further investigation into what makes small-scale reasoning supervision so effective.
