- **[LaViPlan : Language-Guided Visual Path Planning with RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12911)**  `arXiv:2507.12911`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving pose critical challenges, as planners often fail to generalize beyond their training experience, leading to unsafe or unexpected behavior. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in handling such scenarios by providing high-level scene understanding and user-aligned decisions. However, existing VLMs often exhibit a misalignment between their language-based reasoning and the low-level trajectories required for action-level planning. In this paper, we propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to fine-tune VLMs using planning-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that LaViPlan improves planning performance across both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. While linguistic fidelity slightly decreases after RLVR-based fine-tuning, qualitative evaluation indicates that the outputs remain coherent. We also conduct ablation studies to analyze the effects of sampling ratio and reasoning guidance, highlighting how these design choices influence performance. These findings demonstrate the potential of RLVR as a post-training paradigm for aligning language-guided reasoning with action-level planning in autonomous driving.

- **[Can LLM Agents Solve Collaborative Tasks? A Study on Urgency-Aware Planning and Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14635)**  `arXiv:2508.14635`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Jo√£o Vitor de Carvalho Silva, Douglas G. Macharet_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to coordinate actions across multiple agents is critical for solving complex, real-world problems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in communication, planning, and reasoning, raising the question of whether they can also support effective collaboration in multi-agent settings. In this work, we investigate the use of LLM agents to solve a structured victim rescue task that requires division of labor, prioritization, and cooperative planning. Agents operate in a fully known graph-based environment and must allocate resources to victims with varying needs and urgency levels. We systematically evaluate their performance using a suite of coordination-sensitive metrics, including task success rate, redundant actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency. This study offers new insights into the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded multi-agent collaboration tasks, contributing to future benchmarks and architectural improvements.

- **[DEXTER-LLM: Dynamic and Explainable Coordination of Multi-Robot Systems in Unknown Environments via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14387)**  `arXiv:2508.14387`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yuxiao Zhu, Junfeng Chen, Xintong Zhang, Meng Guo, Zhongkui Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Online coordination of multi-robot systems in open and unknown environments faces significant challenges, particularly when semantic features detected during operation dynamically trigger new tasks. Recent large language model (LLMs)-based approaches for scene reasoning and planning primarily focus on one-shot, end-to-end solutions in known environments, lacking both dynamic adaptation capabilities for online operation and explainability in the processes of planning. To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM) for dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i) a mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks specified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an online subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and explainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an optimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via search-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop verification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both subtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected online. The framework effectively combines LLMs' open-world reasoning capabilities with the optimality of model-based assignment methods, simultaneously addressing the critical issue of online adaptability and explainability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate exceptional performances, with 100% success rates across all scenarios, 160 tasks and 480 subtasks completed on average (3 times the baselines), 62% less queries to LLMs during adaptation, and superior plan quality (2 times higher) for compound tasks.

- **[SDS -- See it, Do it, Sorted: Quadruped Skill Synthesis from Single Video Demonstration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11571)**  `arXiv:2410.11571`  `cs.RO`  
  _Maria Stamatopoulou, Jeffrey Li, Dimitrios Kanoulas_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imagine a robot learning locomotion skills from any single video, without labels or reward engineering. We introduce SDS ("See it. Do it. Sorted."), an automated pipeline for skill acquisition from unstructured demonstrations. Using GPT-4o, SDS applies novel prompting techniques, in the form of spatio-temporal grid-based visual encoding ($G_{v}$) and structured input decomposition (SUS). These produce executable reward functions (RF) from the raw input videos. The RFs are used to train PPO policies and are optimized through closed-loop evolution, using training footage and performance metrics as self-supervised signals. SDS allows quadrupeds (e.g. Unitree Go1) to learn four gaits -- trot, bound, pace, and hop -- achieving 100% gait matching fidelity, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance in the order of $10^{-6}$, and stable locomotion with zero failures, both in simulation and the real world. SDS generalizes to morphologically different quadrupeds (e.g. ANYmal) and outperforms prior work in data efficiency, training time and engineering effort.

- **[LGR2: Language Guided Reward Relabeling for Accelerating Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05881)**  `arXiv:2406.05881`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL` `cs.RO`  
  _Utsav Singh, Pramit Bhattacharyya, Vinay P. Namboodiri_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in logical reasoning, in-context learning, and code generation. However, translating natural language instructions into effective robotic control policies remains a significant challenge, especially for tasks requiring long-horizon planning and operating under sparse reward conditions. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) provides a natural framework to address this challenge in robotics; however, it typically suffers from non-stationarity caused by the changing behavior of the lower-level policy during training, destabilizing higher-level policy learning. We introduce LGR2, a novel HRL framework that leverages LLMs to generate language-guided reward functions for the higher-level policy. By decoupling high-level reward generation from low-level policy changes, LGR2 fundamentally mitigates the non-stationarity problem in off-policy HRL, enabling stable and efficient learning. To further enhance sample efficiency in sparse environments, we integrate goal-conditioned hindsight experience relabeling. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world robotic navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate LGR2 outperforms both hierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines, achieving over 55% success rates on challenging tasks and robust transfer to real robots, without additional fine-tuning.

- **[DuPO: Enabling Reliable LLM Self-Verification via Dual Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14460)**  `arXiv:2508.14460`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Shuaijie She, Yu Bao, Yu Lu, Lu Xu, Tao Li, Wenhao Zhu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g., translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information (e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically, DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks, and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general, and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.

- **[Input Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13654)**  `arXiv:2508.13654`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Rapheal Huang, Weilong Guo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out". Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

- **[PepThink-R1: LLM for Interpretable Cyclic Peptide Optimization with CoT SFT and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14765)**  `arXiv:2508.14765`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Ruheng Wang, Hang Zhang, Trieu Nguyen, Shasha Feng, Hao-Wei Pang, Xiang Yu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

- **[Your Reward Function for RL is Your Best PRM for Search: Unifying RL and Search-Based TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14313)**  `arXiv:2508.14313`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Can Jin, Yang Zhou, Qixin Zhang, Hongwu Peng, Di Zhang, Marco Pavone, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model, matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms, our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data. These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex reasoning tasks in LLMs.

- **[PersRM-R1: Enhance Personalized Reward Modeling with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14076)**  `arXiv:2508.14076`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Mengdi Li, Guanqiao Chen, Xufeng Zhao, Haochen Wen, Shu Yang, Di Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reward models (RMs), which are central to existing post-training methods, aim to align LLM outputs with human values by providing feedback signals during fine-tuning. However, existing RMs struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific preferences, especially under limited data and across diverse domains. Thus, we introduce PersRM-R1, the first reasoning-based reward modeling framework specifically designed to identify and represent personal factors from only one or a few personal exemplars. To address challenges including limited data availability and the requirement for robust generalization, our approach combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline consisting of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy and generalizability, paving the way for more effective personalized LLMs.

- **[MissionHD: Data-Driven Refinement of Reasoning Graph Structure through Hyperdimensional Causal Path Encoding and Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14746)**  `arXiv:2508.14746`  `cs.LG`  
  _Sanggeon Yun, Raheeb Hassan, Ryozo Masukawa, Mohsen Imani_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning graphs from Large Language Models (LLMs) are often misaligned with downstream visual tasks such as video anomaly detection (VAD). Existing Graph Structure Refinement (GSR) methods are ill-suited for these novel, dataset-less graphs. We introduce Data-driven GSR (D-GSR), a new paradigm that directly optimizes graph structure using downstream task data, and propose MissionHD, a hyperdimensional computing (HDC) framework to operationalize it. MissionHD uses an efficient encode-decode process to refine the graph, guided by the downstream task signal. Experiments on challenging VAD and VAR benchmarks show significant performance improvements when using our refined graphs, validating our approach as an effective pre-processing step.

- **[Toward Lifelong Learning in Equilibrium Propagation: Sleep-like and Awake Rehearsal for Enhanced Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14081)**  `arXiv:2508.14081`  `cs.LG`  
  _Yoshimasa Kubo, Jean Erik Delanois, Maxim Bazhenov_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP), a biologically plausible training algorithm, have demonstrated strong performance in various tasks such as image classification and reinforcement learning. However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous learning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is overwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the human brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided by processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of learned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found that SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC implemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model (MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks incorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP performed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models on the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets. Combining SRC with rehearsal, also known as "awake replay", further boosted the network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new tasks. Our study reveals the applicability of sleep-like replay techniques to RNNs and highlights the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors into artificial neural networks (ANNs).

- **[KnowDR-REC: A Benchmark for Referring Expression Comprehension with Real-World Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14080)**  `arXiv:2508.14080`  `cs.LG`  
  _Guanghao Jin, Jingpei Wu, Tianpei Guo, Yiyi Niu, Weidong Zhou, Guoyang Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a popular multimodal task that aims to accurately detect target objects within a single image based on a given textual expression. However, due to the limitations of earlier models, traditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack sufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC, characterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world knowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image. Secondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via fine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and anti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics to systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results showing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual grounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are significantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely affect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning. We anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards developing more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding frameworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal systems for complex real-world scenarios.

- **[LLM4FS: Leveraging Large Language Models for Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24157)**  `arXiv:2503.24157`  `cs.LG`  
  _Jianhao Li, Xianchao Xiu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have provided new opportunities for decision-making, particularly in the task of automated feature selection. In this paper, we first comprehensively evaluate LLM-based feature selection methods, covering the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-R1, GPT-o3-mini, and GPT-4.5. Then, we propose a new hybrid strategy called LLM4FS that integrates LLMs with traditional data-driven methods. Specifically, input data samples into LLMs, and directly call traditional data-driven techniques such as random forest and forward sequential selection. Notably, our analysis reveals that the hybrid strategy leverages the contextual understanding of LLMs and the high statistical reliability of traditional data-driven methods to achieve excellent feature selection performance, even surpassing LLMs and traditional data-driven methods. Finally, we point out the limitations of its application in decision-making. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  _Ronghao Dang, Yuqian Yuan, Yunxuan Mao, Kehan Li, Jiangpin Liu, Zhikai Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce RynnEC, a video multimodal large language model designed for embodied cognition. Built upon a general-purpose vision-language foundation model, RynnEC incorporates a region encoder and a mask decoder, enabling flexible region-level video interaction. Despite its compact architecture, RynnEC achieves state-of-the-art performance in object property understanding, object segmentation, and spatial reasoning. Conceptually, it offers a region-centric video paradigm for the brain of embodied agents, providing fine-grained perception of the physical world and enabling more precise interactions. To mitigate the scarcity of annotated 3D datasets, we propose an egocentric video based pipeline for generating embodied cognition data. Furthermore, we introduce RynnEC-Bench, a region-centered benchmark for evaluating embodied cognitive capabilities. We anticipate that RynnEC will advance the development of general-purpose cognitive cores for embodied agents and facilitate generalization across diverse embodied tasks. The code, model checkpoints, and benchmark are available at:this https URL

- **[RotBench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Identifying Image Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13968)**  `arXiv:2508.13968`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Tianyi Niu, Jaemin Cho, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0¬∞, 90¬∞, 180¬∞, and 270¬∞. This task demands robust visual reasoning capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information -- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0¬∞) images, while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180¬∞) images. None can reliably distinguish between 90¬∞ and 270¬∞. Simultaneously showing the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve models' ability to distinguish 90¬∞ and 270¬∞ rotations, despite substantially improving the identification of 180¬∞ images. Together, these results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and human perception in identifying rotation.

  _Simindokht Jahangard, Mehrzad Mohammadi, Yi Shen, Zhixi Cai, Hamid Rezatofighi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

- **[Bench2ADVLM: A Closed-Loop Benchmark for Vision-language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02028)**  `arXiv:2508.02028`  `cs.CV`  
  _Tianyuan Zhang, Ting Jin, Lu Wang, Jiangfan Liu, Siyuan Liang, Mingchuan Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience, and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design, heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution. Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop conditions.

- **[CoT-Segmenter: Enhancing OOD Detection in Dense Road Scenes via Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03984)**  `arXiv:2507.03984`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jeonghyo Song, Kimin Yun, DaeUng Jo, Jinyoung Kim, Youngjoon Yoo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is criti-cal for ensuring the reliability of semantic segmentation models, particularly in complex road environments where safety and accuracy are paramount. Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, which significantly enhanced multimodal reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, the application of CoT-based visual reasoning for OOD semantic segmentation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, through extensive analyses of the road scene anomalies, we identify three challenging scenarios where current state-of-the-art OOD segmentation methods consistently struggle: (1) densely packed and overlapping objects, (2) distant scenes with small objects, and (3) large foreground-dominant objects. To address the presented challenges, we propose a novel CoT-based framework targeting OOD detection in road anomaly scenes. Our method leverages the extensive knowledge and reasoning capabilities of foundation models, such as GPT-4, to enhance OOD detection through improved image understanding and prompt-based reasoning aligned with observed problematic scene attributes. Extensive experiments show that our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both standard benchmarks and our newly defined challenging subset of the RoadAnomaly dataset, offering a robust and interpretable solution for OOD semantic segmentation in complex driving environments.

- **[VBench-2.0: Advancing Video Generation Benchmark Suite for Intrinsic Faithfulness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21755)**  `arXiv:2503.21755`  `cs.CV`  
  _Dian Zheng, Ziqi Huang, Hongbo Liu, Kai Zou, Yinan He, Fan Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video generation has advanced significantly, evolving from producing unrealistic outputs to generating videos that appear visually convincing and temporally coherent. To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such as VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors like per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence. However, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus on whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres to real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on these metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just visually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real "world models" through video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to ensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning, anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of realism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and simulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a next-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative models for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key dimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and Commonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored to individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such as SOTA VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection methods proposed for video generation. We conduct extensive human annotations to ensure evaluation alignment with human judgment. By pushing beyond superficial faithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new standard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of intrinsic faithfulness.

  _Sonakshi Chauhan, Maheep Chaudhary, Koby Choy, Samuel Nellessen, Nandi Schoots_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper we explore where information is collected and how it is propagated throughout layers in large language models (LLMs). We begin by examining the surprising computational importance of punctuation tokens which previous work has identified as attention sinks and memory aids. Using intervention-based techniques, we evaluate the necessity and sufficiency (for preserving model performance) of punctuation tokens across layers in GPT-2, DeepSeek, and Gemma. Our results show stark model-specific differences: for GPT-2, punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple layers, while this holds far less in DeepSeek and not at all in Gemma. Extending beyond punctuation, we ask whether LLMs process different components of input (e.g., subjects, adjectives, punctuation, full sentences) by forming early static summaries reused across the network, or if the model remains sensitive to changes in these components across layers. Extending beyond punctuation, we investigate whether different reasoning rules are processed differently by LLMs. In particular, through interchange intervention and layer-swapping experiments, we find that conditional statements (if, then), and universal quantification (for all) are processed very differently. Our findings offer new insight into the internal mechanisms of punctuation usage and reasoning in LLMs and have implications for interpretability.

  Scaling inference through long chains-of-thought (CoTs) has unlocked impressive reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), yet the reasoning process remains almost exclusively English-centric. We construct translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen 2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments reveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot language varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves performance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and proves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning remain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but does not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune using only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\% in Swahili. Third, data quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully curated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier corpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated datasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.

  We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models. Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model (Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe. After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to 128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision). Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like 8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with the majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.

  Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly challenging as model capabilities advance rapidly. While recent models often achieve higher scores on standard benchmarks, these improvements do not consistently reflect enhanced real-world reasoning capabilities. Moreover, widespread overfitting to public benchmarks and the high computational cost of full evaluations have made it both expensive and less effective to distinguish meaningful differences between models. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{T}ransition \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{M}ethod (STEM), a lightweight and interpretable evaluation framework for efficiently estimating the relative capabilities of LLMs. STEM identifies \textit{significant transition samples} (STS) by analyzing consistent performance transitions among LLMs of the same architecture but varying parameter scales. These samples enable STEM to effectively estimate the capability position of an unknown model. Qwen3 model family is applied to construct the STS pool on six diverse and representative benchmarks. To assess generalizability. Experimental results indicate that STEM reliably captures performance trends, aligns with ground-truth rankings of model capability. These findings highlight STEM as a practical and scalable method for fine-grained, architecture-agnostic evaluation of LLMs.

  Electronic health records (EHRs) are long, noisy, and often redundant, posing a major challenge for the clinicians who must navigate them. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting and reasoning over this unstructured text, but the length of clinical notes often exceeds even state-of-the-art models' extended context windows. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers an alternative by retrieving task-relevant passages from across the entire EHR, potentially reducing the amount of required input tokens. In this work, we propose three clinical tasks designed to be replicable across health systems with minimal effort: 1) extracting imaging procedures, 2) generating timelines of antibiotic use, and 3) identifying key diagnoses. Using EHRs from actual hospitalized patients, we test three state-of-the-art LLMs with varying amounts of provided context, using either targeted text retrieval or the most recent clinical notes. We find that RAG closely matches or exceeds the performance of using recent notes, and approaches the performance of using the models' full context while requiring drastically fewer input tokens. Our results suggest that RAG remains a competitive and efficient approach even as newer models become capable of handling increasingly longer amounts of text.

  Urban transportation systems encounter diverse challenges across multiple tasks, such as traffic forecasting, electric vehicle (EV) charging demand prediction, and taxi dispatch. Existing approaches suffer from two key limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and data-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while large language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural language interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical reasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose TransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal modeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our approach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex dependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph attention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured embeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via reinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input characteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework operates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations, dynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and projecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to generate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three tasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised and zero-shot settings. Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers competitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing strong generalization and cross-task adaptability.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in multilingual contexts, yet their capacity for consistent, logically grounded alignment across languages remains underexplored. We present a controlled evaluation framework for multilingual natural language inference (NLI) that generates synthetic, logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs and translates them into a typologically diverse set of languages. This design enables precise control over semantic relations and allows testing in both monolingual and mixed-language (code-switched) conditions. Surprisingly, code-switching does not degrade, and can even improve, performance, suggesting that translation-induced lexical variation may serve as a regularization signal. We validate semantic preservation through embedding-based similarity analyses and cross-lingual alignment visualizations, confirming the fidelity of translated pairs. Our findings expose both the potential and the brittleness of current LLM cross-lingual reasoning, and identify code-switching as a promising lever for improving multilingual robustness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Connecting LLMs with formal knowledge representation and reasoning is a promising approach to address their shortcomings. Embeddings and sparse autoencoders are widely used to represent textual content, but the semantics are entangled with syntactic and language-specific information. We propose a method that isolates concept semantics in Large Langue Models by averaging concept activations derived via Sparse Autoencoders. We create English text representations from OWL ontology classes, translate the English into French and Chinese and then pass these texts as prompts to the Gemma 2B LLM. Using the open source Gemma Scope suite of Sparse Autoencoders, we obtain concept activations for each class and language version. We average the different language activations to derive a conceptual average. We then correlate the conceptual averages with a ground truth mapping between ontology classes. Our results give a strong indication that the conceptual average aligns to the true relationship between classes when compared with a single language by itself. The result hints at a new technique which enables mechanistic interpretation of internal network states with higher accuracy.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved the accuracy of Text-to-SQL systems. However, a critical challenge remains: the semantic mismatch between natural language questions (NLQs) and their corresponding SQL queries. This issue is exacerbated in large-scale databases, where semantically similar attributes hinder schema linking and semantic drift during SQL generation, ultimately reducing model accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce CRED-SQL, a framework designed for large-scale databases that integrates Cluster Retrieval and Execution Description. CRED-SQL first performs cluster-based large-scale schema retrieval to pinpoint the tables and columns most relevant to a given NLQ, alleviating schema mismatch. It then introduces an intermediate natural language representation-Execution Description Language (EDL)-to bridge the gap between NLQs and SQL. This reformulation decomposes the task into two stages: Text-to-EDL and EDL-to-SQL, leveraging LLMs' strong general reasoning capabilities while reducing semantic deviation. Extensive experiments on two large-scale, cross-domain benchmarks-SpiderUnion and BirdUnion-demonstrate that CRED-SQL achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating its effectiveness and scalability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such as scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback: performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of spontaneous self-reflection, and persistent failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and critique-guided self-refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration. Additionally, we employ a shaping function to amplify learning from correct, especially unfamiliar, refinements and penalize incorrect ones. Extensive experiments with Qwen2.5-7B-Base, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, and Qwen3-8B demonstrate that Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning and RL-based fine-tuning methods across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks. Specifically, Critique-GRPO improves average pass@1 scores across all compared methods by approximately +4.4% on Qwen2.5-7B-Base and +3.8% on Qwen3-8B. Notably, Critique-GRPO enables effective self-improvement through self-critiquing, achieving significant gains over GRPO, e.g., +16.7% pass@1 improvement on AIME 2024.

  Translating chart images into executable plotting scripts-referred to as the chart-to-code generation task-requires Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform fine-grained visual parsing, precise code synthesis, and robust cross-modal reasoning. However, this task is inherently under-constrained: multiple valid code implementations can produce the same visual chart, and evaluation must consider both code correctness and visual fidelity across diverse dimensions. This makes it difficult to learn accurate and generalizable mappings through standard supervised fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose a dual preference-guided refinement framework that combines a feedback-driven, dual-modality reward mechanism with iterative preference learning. Our approach introduces a structured variant generation strategy and a visual reward model to efficiently produce high-quality, aspect-aware preference pairs-making preference collection scalable and supervision more targeted. These preferences are used in an offline reinforcement learning setup to optimize the model toward multi-dimensional fidelity. Experimental results show that our framework significantly enhances the performance of general-purpose open-source MLLMs, enabling them to generate high-quality plotting code that rivals specialized chart-centric models and even some proprietary systems.

  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators offers a scalable alternative to human annotation, yet existing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for judges approaches often fall short in domains requiring complex reasoning. In this work, we investigate whether LLM judges truly benefit from enhanced reasoning capabilities. Through a detailed analysis of reasoning requirements across evaluation tasks, we reveal a negative correlation between SFT performance gains and the proportion of reasoning-demanding samples - highlighting the limitations of SFT in such scenarios. To address this, we introduce JudgeLRM, a family of judgment-oriented LLMs trained using reinforcement learning (RL) with judge-wise, outcome-driven rewards. JudgeLRM models consistently outperform both SFT-tuned and state-of-the-art reasoning models. Notably, JudgeLRM-3B surpasses GPT-4, and JudgeLRM-7B outperforms DeepSeek-R1 by 2.79% in F1 score, particularly excelling in judge tasks requiring deep reasoning.

  Synthetic data generation has recently emerged as a promising approach for enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) without the need for expensive human annotations. However, existing methods often generate data that can be low quality or contrived. In this paper, we introduce Source2Synth, a scalable approach for synthetic data generation and curation that is grounded in real-world data sources. Source2Synth takes as input a custom data source and produces synthetic data examples with intermediate reasoning steps. Our method improves the dataset quality by discarding low-quality generations based on their answerability. We demonstrate the generality of this approach by applying it to two tasks that leverage two different types of data: multi-hop question answering (MHQA), where we test complex reasoning abilities leveraging documents, and tabular question answering (TQA), where we test tool usage leveraging tables. Our method improves performance by 25.51% for TQA on WikiSQL and 22.57% for MHQA on HotpotQA compared to the fine-tuned baselines.

  Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have dramatically advanced the research field and delivered powerful vision-language understanding capabilities. However, these models often inherit deep-rooted social biases from their training data, leading to uncomfortable responses with respect to attributes such as race and gender. This paper addresses the issue of social biases in MLLMs by i) introducing a comprehensive counterfactual dataset with multiple social concepts (CMSC), which complements existing datasets by providing 18 diverse and balanced social concepts; and ii) proposing a counter-stereotype debiasing (CSD) strategy that mitigates social biases in MLLMs by leveraging the opposites of prevalent stereotypes. CSD incorporates both a novel bias-aware data sampling method and a loss rescaling method, enabling the model to effectively reduce biases. We conduct extensive experiments with four prevalent MLLM architectures. The results demonstrate the advantage of the CMSC dataset and the edge of CSD strategy in reducing social biases compared to existing competing methods, without compromising the overall performance on general multi-modal reasoning benchmarks.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations, we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS) strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and robustness of SvS.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving problems with clear and complete statements, but often struggle with nuanced environments or interactive tasks which are common in most real-world scenarios. This highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention. Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following, reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling complex, interactive scenarios and offers a robust platform for future research aimed at improving these critical capabilities.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in human-level reasoning and generation capabilities, which encourages extensive research on their application in mathematical problem solving. However, current work has been largely focused on text-based mathematical problems, with limited investigation in problems involving geometric information. Addressing this gap, we aim to enable LLMs to solve geometric problems by understanding image input. We first analyze the limitations of current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this area: they struggle to accurately comprehending basic geometric elements and their relationships. To overcome these challenges, we take advantage of the unique characteristics of geometric problems (such as unique geometric logical form, and geometric scalability) and the capacity of the textual LLMs to build an enriched multimodal geometry dataset based on existing data. The augmented dataset, Geo170K, contains more than 170K geometric image-caption and question-answer pairs. Utilizing our constructed Geo170K dataset, we develop G-LLaVA, which demonstrates exceptional performance in solving geometric problems, significantly outperforming GPT-4-V on the MathVista benchmark with only 7B parameters.

  The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However, existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6 core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks. Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks. Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP ecosystem.

  Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations: high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes, providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization modeling.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, including programming, planning, and decision-making. However, their performance often degrades when faced with highly complex problem instances that require deep reasoning over long horizons. In such cases, direct problem-solving approaches can lead to inefficiency or failure due to the lack of structured intermediate guidance. To address this, we propose a novel self-evolve framework, EvoCurr, in which a dedicated curriculum-generation LLM constructs a sequence of problem instances with gradually increasing difficulty, tailored to the solver LLM's learning progress. The curriculum dynamically adapts easing challenges when the solver struggles and escalating them when success is consistent, thus maintaining an optimal learning trajectory. This approach enables the solver LLM, implemented as a code-generation model producing Python decision-tree scripts, to progressively acquire the skills needed for complex decision-making tasks. Experimental results on challenging decision-making benchmarks show that our method significantly improves task success rates and solution efficiency compared to direct-solving baselines.

  Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified.

  Large language models (LLMs) are being piloted for clinical coding and decision support, yet no open benchmark targets the hospital-funding layer where Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) determine reimbursement. In most OECD systems, DRGs route a substantial share of multi-trillion-dollar health spending through governed grouper software, making transparency and auditability first-order concerns. We release NordDRG-AI-Benchmark, the first public, rule-complete test bed for DRG reasoning. The package includes (i) machine-readable approximately 20-sheet NordDRG definition tables and (ii) expert manuals and change-log templates that capture governance workflows. It exposes two suites: a 13-task Logic benchmark (code lookup, cross-table inference, grouping features, multilingual terminology, and CC/MCC validity checks) and a 13-task Grouper benchmark that requires full DRG grouper emulation with strict exact-match scoring on both the DRG and the triggeringthis http URL. Lightweight reference agents (LogicAgent, GrouperAgent) enable artefact-only evaluation. Under an artefact-only (no web) setting, on the 13 Logic tasks GPT-5 Thinking and Opus 4.1 score 13/13, o3 scores 12/13; mid-tier models (GPT-5 Thinking Mini, o4-mini, GPT-5 Fast) achieve 6-8/13, and remaining models score 5/13 or below. On full grouper emulation across 13 tasks, GPT-5 Thinking solves 7/13, o3 6/13, o4-mini 3/13; GPT-5 Thinking Mini solves 1/13, and all other tested endpoints score 0/13. To our knowledge, this is the first public report of an LLM partially emulating the complete NordDRG grouper logic with governance-grade traceability. Coupling a rule-complete release with exact-match tasks and open scoring provides a reproducible yardstick for head-to-head and longitudinal evaluation in hospital funding. Benchmark materials available in Github.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks requiring precise, verifiable computation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.

  We devise an algorithm to generate propositions that objectively instantiate graphs supporting coherence-driven inference. We also benchmark the ability of large language models (LLMs) to reconstruct coherence graphs from (a simple transformation of) propositions expressed in natural language, with promising results from a single prompt to reasoning-optimized LLMs. For example, o1/3/4-mini achieve perfect reconstruction half of the time on sparse graphs. Coherence-driven inference on consistency evaluations by LLMs may advance machine cognition capabilities.
