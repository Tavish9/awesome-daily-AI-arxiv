  Enabling robots to perform diverse tasks across varied environments is a central challenge in robot learning. While vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise for generalizable robot skills, realizing their full potential requires addressing limitations in action representation and efficient training. Current VLA models often focus on scaling the vision-language model (VLM) component, while the action space representation remains a critical bottleneck. This paper introduces DexVLA, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and generalization capabilities of VLAs for complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse robot embodiments. DexVLA features a novel diffusion-based action expert, scaled to one billion parameters, designed for cross-embodiment learning. A novel embodiment curriculum learning strategy facilitates efficient training: (1) pre-training the diffusion expert that is separable from the VLA on cross-embodiment data, (2) aligning the VLA model to specific embodiments, and (3) post-training for rapid adaptation to new tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple embodiments, including single-arm, bimanual, and dexterous hand, demonstrating DexVLA's adaptability to challenging tasks without task-specific adaptation, its ability to learn dexterous skills on novel embodiments with limited data, and its capacity to complete complex, long-horizon tasks using only direct language prompting, such as laundry folding. In all settings, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models like Octo, OpenVLA, and Diffusion Policy.

  In this paper, we present DiffusionVLA, a novel framework that seamlessly combines the autoregression model with the diffusion model for learning visuomotor policy. Central to our approach is a next-token prediction objective, enabling the model to reason effectively over the user's query in the context of current observations. Subsequently, a diffusion model is attached to generate robust action outputs. To enhance policy learning through self-reasoning, we introduce a novel reasoning injection module that integrates reasoning phrases directly into the policy learning process. The whole framework is simple and flexible, making it easy to deploy and upgrade. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple real robots to validate the effectiveness of DiffusionVLA. Our tests include a challenging factory sorting task, where DiffusionVLA successfully categorizes objects, including those not seen during training. We observe that the reasoning module makes the model interpretable. It allows observers to understand the model thought process and identify potential causes of policy failures. Additionally, we test DiffusionVLA on a zero-shot bin-picking task, achieving 63.7\% accuracy on 102 previously unseen objects. Our method demonstrates robustness to visual changes, such as distractors and new backgrounds, and easily adapts to new embodiments. Furthermore, DiffusionVLA can follow novel instructions and retain conversational ability. Notably, DiffusionVLA is data-efficient and fast at inference; our smallest DiffusionVLA-2B runs 82Hz on a single A6000 GPU and can train from scratch on less than 50 demonstrations for a complex task. Finally, we scale the model from 2B to 72B parameters, showcasing improved generalization capabilities with increased model size.

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable potential in visuomotor control and instruction comprehension through end-to-end learning processes. However, current VLA models face significant challenges: they are slow during inference and require extensive pre-training on large amounts of robotic data, making real-world deployment difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new family of compact vision-language-action models, called TinyVLA, which offers two key advantages over existing VLA models: (1) faster inference speeds, and (2) improved data efficiency, eliminating the need for pre-training stage. Our framework incorporates two essential components to build TinyVLA: (1) initializing the policy backbone with robust, high-speed multimodal models, and (2) integrating a diffusion policy decoder during fine-tuning to enable precise robot actions. We conducted extensive evaluations of TinyVLA in both simulation and on real robots, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model, OpenVLA, in terms of speed and data efficiency, while delivering comparable or superior performance. Additionally, TinyVLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities across various dimensions, including language instructions, novel objects, unseen positions, changes in object appearance, background variations, and environmental shifts, often matching or exceeding the performance of OpenVLA. We believe that \methodname offers an interesting perspective on utilizing pre-trained multimodal models for policy learning. Our project is atthis https URL.

- **[From Seeing to Doing: Bridging Reasoning and Decision for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08548)**  `arXiv:2505.08548`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  Achieving generalization in robotic manipulation remains a critical challenge, particularly for unseen scenarios and novel tasks. Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, while building on top of general Vision-Language Models (VLMs), still fall short of achieving robust zero-shot performance due to the scarcity and heterogeneity prevalent in embodied datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FSD (From Seeing to Doing), a novel vision-language model that generates intermediate representations through spatial relationship reasoning, providing fine-grained guidance for robotic manipulation. Our approach combines a hierarchical data pipeline for training with a self-consistency mechanism that aligns spatial coordinates with visual signals. Through extensive experiments, we comprehensively validated FSD's capabilities in both "seeing" and "doing," achieving outstanding performance across 8 benchmarks for general spatial reasoning and embodied reference abilities, as well as on our proposed more challenging benchmark VABench. We also verified zero-shot capabilities in robot manipulation, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods in both SimplerEnv and real robot settings. Experimental results show that FSD achieves 54.1% success rate in SimplerEnv and 72% success rate across 8 real-world tasks, outperforming the strongest baseline by 30%.

  The UAV-VLA (Visual-Language-Action) system is a tool designed to facilitate communication with aerial robots. By integrating satellite imagery processing with the Visual Language Model (VLM) and the powerful capabilities of GPT, UAV-VLA enables users to generate general flight paths-and-action plans through simple text requests. This system leverages the rich contextual information provided by satellite images, allowing for enhanced decision-making and mission planning. The combination of visual analysis by VLM and natural language processing by GPT can provide the user with the path-and-action set, making aerial operations more efficient and accessible. The newly developed method showed the difference in the length of the created trajectory in 22% and the mean error in finding the objects of interest on a map in 34.22 m by Euclidean distance in the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) approach.

  Visuomotor policies trained on human expert demonstrations have recently shown strong performance across a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks. However, these policies remain highly sensitive to domain shifts stemming from background or robot embodiment changes, which limits their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we present ARRO, a novel calibration-free visual representation that leverages zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation and object detection models to efficiently mask out task-irrelevant regions of the scene without requiring additional training. By filtering visual distractors and overlaying virtual guides during both training and inference, ARRO improves robustness to scene variations and reduces the need for additional data collection. We extensively evaluate ARRO with Diffusion Policy on several tabletop manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments, and further demonstrate its compatibility and effectiveness with generalist robot policies, such as Octo and OpenVLA. Across all settings in our evaluation, ARRO yields consistent performance gains, allows for selective masking to choose between different objects, and shows robustness even to challenging segmentation conditions.

  Robot chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT) -- wherein a model predicts helpful intermediate representations before choosing actions -- provides an effective method for improving the generalization and performance of robot policies, especially vision-language-action models (VLAs). While such approaches have been shown to improve performance and generalization, they suffer from core limitations, like needing specialized robot reasoning data and slow inference speeds. To design new robot reasoning approaches that address these issues, a more complete characterization of why reasoning helps policy performance is critical. We hypothesize several mechanisms by which robot reasoning improves policies -- (1) better representation learning, (2) improved learning curricularization, and (3) increased expressivity -- then devise simple variants of robot CoT reasoning to isolate and test each one. We find that learning to generate reasonings does lead to better VLA representations, while attending to the reasonings aids in actually leveraging these features for improved action prediction. Our results provide us with a better understanding of why CoT reasoning helps VLAs, which we use to introduce two simple and lightweight alternative recipes for robot reasoning. Our proposed approaches achieve significant performance gains over non-reasoning policies, state-of-the-art results on the LIBERO-90 benchmark, and a 3x inference speedup compared to standard robot reasoning.
