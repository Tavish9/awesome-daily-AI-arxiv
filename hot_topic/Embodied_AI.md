  Vision-language-action (VLA) models integrate visual observations and language instructions to predict robot actions, demonstrating promising generalization in manipulation tasks. However, most existing approaches primarily rely on direct mappings from 2D visual inputs to action sequences, without explicitly modeling the underlying 3D spatial structure or temporal world dynamics. Such representations may limit spatial reasoning and long-horizon decision-making in dynamic environments. To address this limitation, we propose StemVLA, a novel framework that explicitly incorporates both future-oriented 3D spatial knowledge and historical 4D spatiotemporal representations into action prediction. First, instead of relying solely on observed images, StemVLA forecasts structured 3D future spatial-geometric world knowledge, enabling the model to anticipate upcoming scene geometry and object configurations. Second, to capture temporal consistency and motion dynamics, we feed historical image frames into a pretrained video-geometry transformer backbone to extract implicit 3D world representations, and further aggregate them across time using a temporal attention module, termed VideoFormer [20], forming a unified 4D historical spatiotemporal representation. By jointly modeling 2D observations, predicted 3D future structure, and aggregated 4D temporal dynamics, StemVLA enables more comprehensive world understanding for robot manipulation. Extensive experiments in simulation demonstrate that StemVLA significantly improves long-horizon task success and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmark [46], achieving an average sequence length of XXX.

- **[Robust Skills, Brittle Grounding: Diagnosing Restricted Generalization in Vision-Language Action Policies via Multi-Object Picking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24143)**  `arXiv:2602.24143`  `cs.RO`

  Vision-language action (VLA) policies often report strong manipulation benchmark performance with relatively few demonstrations, but it remains unclear whether this reflects robust language-to-object grounding or reliance on object--location correlations that do not transfer beyond the training distribution. We present a controlled multi-object picking study that progressively increases object placement variability up to full workspace randomization and evaluates held-out object--location pairings that break familiar associations without increasing spatial difficulty. Across these stress tests and data scaling, we find that for representative VLA policies, including SmolVLA and $\pi_{0.5}$, execution of the manipulation primitive remains substantially more reliable than instruction-conditioned task success in harder regimes, suggesting that manipulation skill acquisition is decoupled from instruction following. We recommend augmenting manipulation benchmarks with task ladders and decomposed metrics that separately measure primitive execution and instruction-conditioned success to better diagnose instruction-grounded generalization.

- **[FAVLA: A Force-Adaptive Fast-Slow VLA model for Contact-Rich Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23648)**  `arXiv:2602.23648`  `cs.RO`

  Force/torque feedback can substantially improve Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on contact-rich manipulation, but most existing approaches fuse all modalities at a single operating frequency. This design ignores the mismatched sampling rates of real robot sensors, forcing downsampling of the high-frequency contact cues needed for reactive correction. Combined with common VLM-action-expert (AE) pipelines that execute action chunks largely open loop between expensive VLM updates, unified-frequency fusion often yields delayed responses to impacts, stick-slip, and force spikes. We propose FAVLA, a force-adaptive fast-slow VLA that decouples slow perception planning from fast contact-aware control. FAVLA runs a slow VLM at a fixed low frequency to encode modalities to produce latent representations and to predict near-future force variation. A fast AE then executes at a variable high frequency, conditioning on the latest force sequence data to generate reactive actions. We further introduce a force adapter that injects high-frequency force features into multiple AE layers, and adaptively schedules the AE's execution frequency based on the VLM's predicted force variation. Extensive experiments on contact-rich tasks demonstrate that FAVLA significantly outperforms baselines, achieving superior reactivity and success rates, especially with a smaller contact force during manipulation.

- **[VCA: Vision-Click-Action Framework for Precise Manipulation of Segmented Objects in Target Ambiguous Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23583)**  `arXiv:2602.23583`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The reliance on language in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models introduces ambiguity, cognitive overhead, and difficulties in precise object identification and sequential task execution, particularly in environments with multiple visually similar objects. To address these limitations, we propose Vision-Click-Action (VCA), a framework that replaces verbose textual commands with direct, click-based visual interaction using pretrained segmentation models. By allowing operators to specify target objects clearly through visual selection in the robot's 2D camera view, VCA reduces interpretation errors, lowers cognitive load, and provides a practical and scalable alternative to language-driven interfaces for real-world robotic manipulation. Experimental results validate that the proposed VCA framework achieves effective instance-level manipulation of specified target objects. Experiment videos are available atthis https URL.

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable success in robotic tasks like manipulation by fusing a language model's reasoning with a vision model's 3D understanding. However, their high computational cost remains a major obstacle for real-world applications that require real-time performance. We observe that the actions within a task have varying levels of importance: critical steps demand high precision, while less important ones can tolerate more variance. Leveraging this insight, we propose DySL-VLA, a novel framework that addresses computational cost by dynamically skipping VLA layers based on each action's importance. DySL-VLA categorizes its layers into two types: informative layers, which are consistently executed, and incremental layers, which can be selectively skipped. To intelligently skip layers without sacrificing accuracy, we invent a prior-post skipping guidance mechanism to determine when to initiate layer-skipping. We also propose a skip-aware two-stage knowledge distillation algorithm to efficiently train a standard VLA into a DySL-VLA. Our experiments indicate that DySL-VLA achieves 2.1% improvement in success length over Deer-VLA on the Calvin dataset, while simultaneously reducing trainable parameters by a factor of 85.7 and providing a 3.75x speedup relative to the RoboFlamingo baseline at iso-accuracy.

- **[HALO: A Unified Vision-Language-Action Model for Embodied Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21157)**  `arXiv:2602.21157`  `cs.RO`

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown strong performance in robotic manipulation, but often struggle in long-horizon or out-of-distribution scenarios due to the lack of explicit mechanisms for multimodal reasoning and anticipating how the world will evolve under action. Recent works introduce textual chain-of-thought or visual subgoal prediction within VLA models to reason, but still fail to offer a unified human-like reasoning framework for joint textual reasoning, visual foresight, and action prediction. To this end, we propose HALO, a unified VLA model that enables embodied multimodal chain-of-thought (EM-CoT) reasoning through a sequential process of textual task reasoning, visual subgoal prediction for fine-grained guidance, and EM-CoT-augmented action prediction. We instantiate HALO with a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture that decouples semantic reasoning, visual foresight, and action prediction into specialized experts while allowing seamless cross-expert collaboration. To enable HALO learning at scale, we introduce an automated pipeline to synthesize EM-CoT training data along with a carefully crafted training recipe. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) HALO achieves superior performance in both simulated and real-world environments, surpassing baseline policy pi_0 by 34.1% on RoboTwin benchmark; (2) all proposed components of the training recipe and EM-CoT design help improve task success rate; and (3) HALO exhibits strong generalization capabilities under aggressive unseen environmental randomization with our proposed EM-CoT reasoning.

- **[RoboMIND 2.0: A Multimodal, Bimanual Mobile Manipulation Dataset for Generalizable Embodied Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24653)**  `arXiv:2512.24653`  `cs.RO`

  While data-driven imitation learning has revolutionized robotic manipulation, current approaches remain constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse real-world demonstrations. Consequently, the ability of existing models to generalize across long-horizon bimanual tasks and mobile manipulation in unstructured environments remains limited. To bridge this gap, we present RoboMIND 2.0, a comprehensive real-world dataset comprising over 310K dual-arm manipulation trajectories collected across six distinct robot embodiments and 739 complex tasks. Crucially, to support research in contact-rich and spatially extended tasks, the dataset incorporates 12K tactile-enhanced episodes and 20K mobile manipulation trajectories. Complementing this physical data, we construct high-fidelity digital twins of our real-world environments, releasing an additional 20K-trajectory simulated dataset to facilitate robust sim-to-real transfer. To fully exploit the potential of RoboMIND 2.0, we propose MIND-2 system, a hierarchical dual-system frame-work optimized via offline reinforcement learning. MIND-2 integrates a high-level semantic planner (MIND-2-VLM) to decompose abstract natural language instructions into grounded subgoals, coupled with a low-level Vision-Language-Action executor (MIND-2-VLA), which generates precise, proprioception-aware motor actions.

- **[ColaVLA: Leveraging Cognitive Latent Reasoning for Hierarchical Parallel Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22939)**  `arXiv:2512.22939`  `cs.CV`

  Autonomous driving requires generating safe and reliable trajectories from complex multimodal inputs. Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.
