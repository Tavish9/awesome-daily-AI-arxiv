  General-purpose robots need a versatile body and an intelligent mind. Recentadvancements in humanoid robots have shown great promise as a hardware platformfor building generalist autonomy in the human world. A robot foundation model,trained on massive and diverse data sources, is essential for enabling therobots to reason about novel situations, robustly handle real-worldvariability, and rapidly learn new tasks. To this end, we introduce GR00T N1,an open foundation model for humanoid robots. GR00T N1 is aVision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a dual-system architecture. Thevision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision andlanguage instructions. The subsequent diffusion transformer module (System 1)generates fluid motor actions in real time. Both modules are tightly coupledand jointly trained end-to-end. We train GR00T N1 with a heterogeneous mixtureof real-robot trajectories, human videos, and synthetically generated datasets.We show that our generalist robot model GR00T N1 outperforms thestate-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarksacross multiple robot embodiments. Furthermore, we deploy our model on theFourier GR-1 humanoid robot for language-conditioned bimanual manipulationtasks, achieving strong performance with high data efficiency.
