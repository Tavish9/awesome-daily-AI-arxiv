- **[FlowVLA: Thinking in Motion with a Visual Chain of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18269)**  `arXiv:2508.18269`  `cs.RO`

  Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on an internal world model trained via next-frame prediction. This approach, however, struggles with physical reasoning as it entangles static appearance with dynamic motion, often resulting in implausible visual forecasts and inefficient policy learning. To address these limitations, we introduce the Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT): a pre-training framework that encourages a model to reason about how a scene evolves before predicting what it will look like. We instantiate this principle in FlowVLA, which predicts a future frame ($v_{t+1}$) only after generating an intermediate optical flow representation ($f_t$) that encodes motion dynamics. This ``$v_t \rightarrow f_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$'' reasoning process is implemented within a single autoregressive Transformer, guiding the model to learn disentangled dynamics. As a result, FlowVLA produces coherent visual predictions and facilitates more efficient policy learning. Experiments on challenging robotics manipulation benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with substantially improved sample efficiency, pointing toward a more principled foundation for world modeling.

- **[GraphCoT-VLA: A 3D Spatial-Aware Reasoning Vision-Language-Action Model for Robotic Manipulation with Ambiguous Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07650)**  `arXiv:2508.07650`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language-action models have emerged as a crucial paradigm in robotic manipulation. However, existing VLA models exhibit notable limitations in handling ambiguous language instructions and unknown environmental states. Furthermore, their perception is largely constrained to static two-dimensional observations, lacking the capability to model three-dimensional interactions between the robot and its environment. To address these challenges, this paper proposes GraphCoT-VLA, an efficient end-to-end model. To enhance the model's ability to interpret ambiguous instructions and improve task planning, we design a structured Chain-of-Thought reasoning module that integrates high-level task understanding and planning, failed task feedback, and low-level imaginative reasoning about future object positions and robot actions. Additionally, we construct a real-time updatable 3D Pose-Object graph, which captures the spatial configuration of robot joints and the topological relationships between objects in 3D space, enabling the model to better understand and manipulate their interactions. We further integrates a dropout hybrid reasoning strategy to achieve efficient control outputs. Experimental results across multiple real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that GraphCoT-VLA significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of task success rate and response speed, exhibiting strong generalization and robustness in open environments and under uncertain instructions.

- **[MapleGrasp: Mask-guided Feature Pooling for Language-driven Efficient Robotic Grasping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06535)**  `arXiv:2506.06535`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic manipulation of unseen objects via natural language commands remains challenging. Language driven robotic grasping (LDRG) predicts stable grasp poses from natural language queries and RGB-D images. We propose MapleGrasp, a novel framework that leverages mask-guided feature pooling for efficient vision-language driven grasping. Our two-stage training first predicts segmentation masks from CLIP-based vision-language features. The second stage pools features within these masks to generate pixel-level grasp predictions, improving efficiency, and reducing computation. Incorporating mask pooling results in a 7% improvement over prior approaches on the OCID-VLG benchmark. Furthermore, we introduce RefGraspNet, an open-source dataset eight times larger than existing alternatives, significantly enhancing model generalization for open-vocabulary grasping. MapleGrasp scores a strong grasping accuracy of 89\% when compared with competing methods in the RefGraspNet benchmark. Our method achieves comparable performance to larger Vision-Language-Action models on the LIBERO benchmark, and shows significantly better generalization to unseen tasks. Real-world experiments on a Franka arm demonstrate 73% success rate with unseen objects, surpassing competitive baselines by 11%. Code is provided in our github repository.

- **[Continual Learning for Generative AI: From LLMs to MLLMs and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13045)**  `arXiv:2506.13045`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`

  The rapid advancement of generative models has empowered modern AI systems to comprehend and produce highly sophisticated content, even achieving human-level performance in specific domains. However, these models are fundamentally constrained by \emph{catastrophic forgetting}, \ie~a persistent challenge where models experience performance degradation on previously learned tasks when adapting to new tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative AI in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative AI models, encompassing large language models, multimodal large language models, vision-language-action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, thereby providing deeper insights into the field.

- **[NinA: Normalizing Flows in Action. Training VLA Models with Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16845)**  `arXiv:2508.16845`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without compromising performance.

- **[4D Visual Pre-training for Robot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17230)**  `arXiv:2508.17230`  `cs.CV`

  General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However, due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various robot tasks. Our project page is available at: https://4d-this http URL.

- **[VLASCD: A Visual Language Action Model for Simultaneous Chatting and Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15885)**  `arXiv:2410.15885`  `cs.AI`  
  _Zuojin Tang, Bin Hu, Chenyang Zhao, De Ma, Gang Pan, Bin Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent large pretrained models such as LLMs (e.g., GPT series) and VLAs (e.g., OpenVLA) have achieved notable progress on multimodal tasks, yet they are built upon a multi-input single-output (MISO) paradigm. We show that this paradigm fundamentally limits performance in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) scenarios, where parallel task execution is required. In MISO architectures, tasks compete for a shared output channel, creating mutual exclusion effects that cause unbalanced optimization and degraded performance. To address this gap, we introduce MIMO-VLA (VLASCD), a unified training framework that enables concurrent multi-task outputs, exemplified by simultaneous dialogue generation and decision-making. Inspired by human cognition, MIMO-VLA eliminates interference between tasks and supports efficient parallel processing. Experiments on the CARLA autonomous driving platform demonstrate that MIMO-VLA substantially outperforms state-of-the-art MISO-based LLMs, reinforcement learning models, and VLAs in MIMO settings, establishing a new direction for multimodal and multitask learning.
