  Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline.

  Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are built upon an internal world model trained via direct next-frame prediction ($v_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$). This paradigm, however, presents a fundamental challenge: it \textbf{conflates} the task of predicting physical motion with that of rendering static appearance, forcing a single mechanism to handle both. This inherent coupling often leads to physically implausible forecasts and inefficient policy learning. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT)}, a framework that disentangles these processes by compelling the model to first reason about \textbf{motion dynamics} before generating the future frame's \textbf{visual appearance}. We instantiate this principle by proposing \textbf{FlowVLA}, an autoregressive Transformer that explicitly materializes this reasoning process as ``$v_t \rightarrow f_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$'', where $f_t$ is an intermediate optical flow prediction. By forcing the model to first commit to a motion plan ($f_t$), FlowVLA learns disentangled dynamics, resulting in more coherent visual predictions and significantly more efficient policy learning. Experiments on challenging robotics manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that FlowVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with substantially improved sample efficiency, pointing toward a more principled foundation for world modeling in VLAs.

- **[DreamVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model Dreamed with Comprehensive World Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04447)**  `arXiv:2507.04447`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`

  Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise in integrating image generation with action prediction to improve generalization and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic, spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically, DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction, integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.

- **[Weakly-Supervised 3D Visual Grounding based on Visual Language Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09625)**  `arXiv:2312.09625`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`

  Learning to ground natural language queries to target objects or regions in 3D point clouds is quite essential for 3D scene understanding. Nevertheless, existing 3D visual grounding approaches require a substantial number of bounding box annotations for text queries, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose 3D-VLA, a weakly supervised approach for 3D visual grounding based on Visual Linguistic Alignment. Our 3D-VLA exploits the superior ability of current large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) on aligning the semantics between texts and 2D images, as well as the naturally existing correspondences between 2D images and 3D point clouds, and thus implicitly constructs correspondences between texts and 3D point clouds with no need for fine-grained box annotations in the training procedure. During the inference stage, the learned text-3D correspondence will help us ground the text queries to the 3D target objects even without 2D images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate 3D visual grounding in a weakly supervised manner by involving large scale vision-language models, and extensive experiments on ReferIt3D and ScanRefer datasets demonstrate that our 3D-VLA achieves comparable and even superior results over the fully supervised methods.
