  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced general-purpose robotic manipulation by leveraging pretrained visual and linguistic representations. However, they struggle with contact-rich tasks that require fine-grained control involving force, especially under visual occlusion or dynamic uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose ForceVLA, a novel end-to-end manipulation framework that treats external force sensing as a first-class modality within VLA systems. ForceVLA introduces FVLMoE, a force-aware Mixture-of-Experts fusion module that dynamically integrates pretrained visual-language embeddings with real-time 6-axis force feedback during action decoding. This enables context-aware routing across modality-specific experts, enhancing the robot's ability to adapt to subtle contact dynamics. We also introduce \textbf{ForceVLA-Data}, a new dataset comprising synchronized vision, proprioception, and force-torque signals across five contact-rich manipulation tasks. ForceVLA improves average task success by 23.2% over strong pi_0-based baselines, achieving up to 80% success in tasks such as plug insertion. Our approach highlights the importance of multimodal integration for dexterous manipulation and sets a new benchmark for physically intelligent robotic control. Code and data will be released atthis https URL.

  We present LightVLA, a simple yet effective differentiable token pruning framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models. While VLA models have shown impressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment on resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy attention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA addresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual tokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and adopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through fine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens while pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby improving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires no heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters, making it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token pruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher success rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically, LightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9% improvement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable query-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable parameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that as VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune tokens from a performance-driven perspective. To the best of our knowledge, LightVLA is the first work to apply adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks with the collateral goals of efficiency and performance, marking a significant step toward more efficient, powerful and practical real-time robotic systems.

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes open-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.
