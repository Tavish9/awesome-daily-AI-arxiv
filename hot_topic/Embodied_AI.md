  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces RT-cache, a novel trajectorymemory pipeline that accelerates real-world robot inference by leveraging big-data retrieval and learning from experience. While modern Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can handle diverse robotic tasks, they often incur high per-step inference costs, resulting in significant latency, sometimes minutes per task. In contrast, RT-cache stores a large-scale Memory of previously successful robot trajectories and retrieves relevant multistep motion snippets, drastically reducing inference overhead. By integrating a Memory Builder with a Trajectory Retrieval, we develop an efficient retrieval process that remains tractable even for extremely large datasets. RT-cache flexibly accumulates real-world experiences and replays them whenever the current scene matches past states, adapting quickly to new or unseen environments with only a few additional samples. Experiments on the Open-X Embodiment Dataset and other real-world data demonstrate that RT-cache completes tasks both faster and more successfully than a baseline lacking retrieval, suggesting a practical, data-driven solution for real-time manipulation.

  Scaling robot learning requires vast and diverse datasets. Yet the prevailing data collection paradigm-human teleoperation-remains costly and constrained by manual effort and physical robot access. We introduce Real2Render2Real (R2R2R), a novel approach for generating robot training data without relying on object dynamics simulation or teleoperation of robot hardware. The input is a smartphone-captured scan of one or more objects and a single video of a human demonstration. R2R2R renders thousands of high visual fidelity robot-agnostic demonstrations by reconstructing detailed 3D object geometry and appearance, and tracking 6-DoF object motion. R2R2R uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enable flexible asset generation and trajectory synthesis for both rigid and articulated objects, converting these representations to meshes to maintain compatibility with scalable rendering engines like IsaacLab but with collision modeling off. Robot demonstration data generated by R2R2R integrates directly with models that operate on robot proprioceptive states and image observations, such as vision-language-action models (VLA) and imitation learning policies. Physical experiments suggest that models trained on R2R2R data from a single human demonstration can match the performance of models trained on 150 human teleoperation demonstrations.

- **[VTLA: Vision-Tactile-Language-Action Model with Preference Learning for Insertion Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09577)**  `arXiv:2505.09577`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While vision-language models have advanced significantly, their application in language-conditioned robotic manipulation is still underexplored, especially for contact-rich tasks that extend beyond visually dominant pick-and-place scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Vision-Tactile-Language-Action model, a novel framework that enables robust policy generation in contact-intensive scenarios by effectively integrating visual and tactile inputs through cross-modal language grounding. A low-cost, multi-modal dataset has been constructed in a simulation environment, containing vision-tactile-action-instruction pairs specifically designed for the fingertip insertion task. Furthermore, we introduce Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to offer regression-like supervision for the VTLA model, effectively bridging the gap between classification-based next token prediction loss and continuous robotic tasks. Experimental results show that the VTLA model outperforms traditional imitation learning methods (e.g., diffusion policies) and existing multi-modal baselines (TLA/VLA), achieving over 90% success rates on unseen peg shapes. Finally, we conduct real-world peg-in-hole experiments to demonstrate the exceptional Sim2Real performance of the proposed VTLA model.
