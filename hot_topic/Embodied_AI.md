  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are evolving into language-interactive platforms, enabling more intuitive forms of human-drone interaction. While prior works have primarily focused on high-level planning and long-horizon navigation, we shift attention to language-guided fine-grained trajectory control, where UAVs execute short-range, reactive flight behaviors in response to language instructions. We formalize this problem as the Flying-on-a-Word (Flow) task and introduce UAV imitation learning as an effective approach. In this framework, UAVs learn fine-grained control policies by mimicking expert pilot trajectories paired with atomic language instructions. To support this paradigm, we present UAV-Flow, the first real-world benchmark for language-conditioned, fine-grained UAV control. It includes a task formulation, a large-scale dataset collected in diverse environments, a deployable control framework, and a simulation suite for systematic evaluation. Our design enables UAVs to closely imitate the precise, expert-level flight trajectories of human pilots and supports direct deployment without sim-to-real gap. We conduct extensive experiments on UAV-Flow, benchmarking VLN and VLA paradigms. Results show that VLA models are superior to VLN baselines and highlight the critical role of spatial grounding in the fine-grained Flow setting.

  The generalization capabilities of vision-language-action (VLA) models to unseen tasks are crucial to achieving general-purpose robotic manipulation in open-world settings. However, the cross-task generalization capabilities of existing VLA models remain significantly underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce AGNOSTOS, a novel simulation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate cross-task zero-shot generalization in manipulation. AGNOSTOS comprises 23 unseen manipulation tasks for testing, distinct from common training task distributions, and incorporates two levels of generalization difficulty to assess robustness. Our systematic evaluation reveals that current VLA models, despite being trained on diverse datasets, struggle to generalize effectively to these unseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose Cross-Task In-Context Manipulation (X-ICM), a method that conditions large language models (LLMs) on in-context demonstrations from seen tasks to predict action sequences for unseen tasks. Additionally, we introduce a dynamics-guided sample selection strategy that identifies relevant demonstrations by capturing cross-task dynamics. On AGNOSTOS, X-ICM significantly improves cross-task zero-shot generalization performance over leading VLAs. We believe AGNOSTOS and X-ICM will serve as valuable tools for advancing general-purpose robotic manipulation.

  Recent high-capacity vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive performance on a range of robotic manipulation tasks by imitating human demonstrations. However, exploiting offline data with limited visited states will cause execution failure in out-of-distribution scenarios. Intuitively, an exploration-based method that improves on online collected data at test time could address this limitation. We present VLA-RL, an algorithmic and systematic framework that leverages online reinforcement learning (RL) to improve pretrained auto-regressive VLAs in downstream tasks. Within a unified perspective, we first introduce a trajectory-level RL formulation for auto-regressive VLA training, which models general robotic manipulation trajectory as multi-modal multi-turn conversation. To address the challenge of sparse rewards, we fine-tune a pretrained vision-language model as a robotic process reward model, which is trained on pseudo reward labels annotated on automatically extracted task segments. To scale up, we identify several implementation findings that improve the stability and efficiency including curriculum selection strategy, GPU-balanced vectorized environments, batch decoding, and critic warmup. VLA-RL enables OpenVLA-7B to surpass the strongest finetuned baseline by 4.5% on 40 challenging robotic manipulation tasks in LIBERO, and even matches the performance of advanced commercial models such as $\pi_0$-FAST. Notably, we observe that VLA-RL benefits from increased test-time optimization, indicating an early spark of inference scaling laws in robotics.

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently advanced robotic manipulation by translating natural-language instructions and image information into sequential control actions. However, these models often underperform in open-world scenarios, as they are predominantly trained on successful expert demonstrations and exhibit a limited capacity for failure recovery. In this work, we present a Robotic Failure Analysis and Correction (RoboFAC) framework to address this issue. Firstly, we construct RoboFAC dataset comprising 9,440 erroneous manipulation trajectories and 78,623 QA pairs across 16 diverse tasks and 53 scenes in both simulation and real-world environments. Leveraging our dataset, we develop RoboFAC model, which is capable of Task Understanding, Failure Analysis and Failure Correction. Experimental results demonstrate that the RoboFAC model outperforms GPT-4o by 34.1% on our evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, we integrate the RoboFAC model into a real-world VLA control pipeline as an external supervision providing correction instructions, yielding a 29.1% relative improvement on average on four real-world tasks. The results show that our RoboFAC framework effectively handles robotic failures and assists the VLA model in recovering from failures.

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in the field of embodied intelligence, enabling agents to follow human instructions to complete complex tasks in physical environments. Existing embodied agents are often trained through behavior cloning, which requires expensive data and computational resources and is constrained by human demonstrations. To address this issue, many researchers explore the application of reinforcement fine-tuning to embodied agents. However, typical reinforcement fine-tuning methods for embodied agents usually rely on sparse, outcome-based rewards, which struggle to provide fine-grained feedback for specific actions within an episode, thus limiting the model's manipulation capabilities and generalization performance. In this paper, we propose RFTF, a novel reinforcement fine-tuning method that leverages a value model to generate dense rewards in embodied scenarios. Specifically, our value model is trained using temporal information, eliminating the need for costly robot action labels. In addition, RFTF incorporates a range of techniques, such as GAE and sample balance to enhance the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process. By addressing the sparse reward problem in reinforcement fine-tuning, our method significantly improves the performance of embodied agents, delivering superior generalization and adaptation capabilities across diverse embodied tasks. Experimental results show that embodied agents fine-tuned with RFTF achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the challenging CALVIN ABC-D with an average success length of 4.296. Moreover, RFTF enables rapid adaptation to new environments. After fine-tuning in the D environment of CALVIN for a few episodes, RFTF achieved an average success length of 4.301 in this new environment.

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have gained much attention from the research community thanks to their strength in translating multimodal observations with linguistic instructions into robotic actions. Despite their recent advancements, VLAs often overlook the explicit reasoning and only learn the functional input-action mappings, omitting these crucial logical steps for interpretability and generalization for complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. In this work, we propose \textit{ReFineVLA}, a multimodal reasoning-aware framework that fine-tunes VLAs with teacher-guided reasons. We first augment robotic datasets with reasoning rationales generated by an expert teacher model, guiding VLA models to learn to reason about their actions. Then, we use \textit{ReFineVLA} to fine-tune pre-trained VLAs with the reasoning-enriched datasets, while maintaining their inherent generalization abilities and boosting reasoning capabilities. In addition, we conduct an attention map visualization to analyze the alignment among visual attention, linguistic prompts, and to-be-executed actions of \textit{ReFineVLA}, showcasing its ability to focus on relevant tasks and actions. Through the latter step, we explore that \textit{ReFineVLA}-trained models exhibit a meaningful attention shift towards relevant objects, highlighting the enhanced multimodal understanding and improved generalization.Evaluated across manipulation tasks, \textit{ReFineVLA} outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, it achieves an average increase of $5.0\%$ success rate on SimplerEnv WidowX Robot tasks, improves by an average of $8.6\%$ in variant aggregation settings, and by $1.7\%$ in visual matching settings for SimplerEnv Google Robot tasks. The source code will be publicly available.

- **[Genie Centurion: Accelerating Scalable Real-World Robot Training with Human Rewind-and-Refine Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18793)**  `arXiv:2505.18793`  `cs.RO`

  While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show strong generalizability in various tasks, real-world deployment of robotic policy still requires large-scale, high-quality human expert demonstrations. However, passive data collection via human teleoperation is costly, hard to scale, and often biased toward passive demonstrations with limited diversity. To address this, we propose Genie Centurion (GCENT), a scalable and general data collection paradigm based on human rewind-and-refine guidance. When the robot execution failures occur, GCENT enables the system revert to a previous state with a rewind mechanism, after which a teleoperator provides corrective demonstrations to refine the policy. This framework supports a one-human-to-many-robots supervision scheme with a Task Sentinel module, which autonomously predicts task success and solicits human intervention when necessary, enabling scalable supervision. Empirical results show that GCENT achieves up to 40% higher task success rates than state-of-the-art data collection methods, and reaches comparable performance using less than half the data. We also quantify the data yield-to-effort ratio under multi-robot scenarios, demonstrating GCENT's potential for scalable and cost-efficient robot policy training in real-world environments.

  Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization. The project page is atthis https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spike cameras offer unique sensing capabilities but their sparse, asynchronous output challenges semantic understanding, especially for Spike Video-Language Alignment (Spike-VLA) where models like CLIP underperform due to modality mismatch. We introduce SPKLIP, the first architecture specifically for Spike-VLA. SPKLIP employs a hierarchical spike feature extractor that adaptively models multi-scale temporal dynamics in event streams, and uses spike-text contrastive learning to directly align spike video with language, enabling effective few-shot learning. A full-spiking visual encoder variant, integrating SNN components into our pipeline, demonstrates enhanced energy efficiency. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on benchmark spike datasets and strong few-shot generalization on a newly contributed real-world dataset. SPKLIP's energy efficiency highlights its potential for neuromorphic deployment, advancing event-based multimodal research. The source code and dataset are available at [link removed for anonymity].

  Research interest in end-to-end autonomous driving has surged owing to its fully differentiable design integrating modular tasks, i.e. perception, prediction and planing, which enables optimization in pursuit of the ultimate goal. Despite the great potential of the end-to-end paradigm, existing methods suffer from several aspects including expensive BEV (bird's eye view) computation, action diversity, and sub-optimal decision in complex real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid sparse-dense diffusion policy, empowered by a Vision-Language Model (VLM), called Diff-VLA. We explore the sparse diffusion representation for efficient multi-modal driving behavior. Moreover, we rethink the effectiveness of VLM driving decision and improve the trajectory generation guidance through deep interaction across agent, map instances and VLM output. Our method shows superior performance in Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025 which contains challenging real and reactive synthetic scenarios. Our methods achieves 45.0 PDMS.
