  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a prominent research area, showcasing significant potential across a variety of applications. However, their performance in endoscopy robotics, particularly endoscopy capsule robots that perform actions within the digestive system, remains unexplored. The integration of VLA models into endoscopy robots allows more intuitive and efficient interactions between human operators and medical devices, improving both diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes. In this work, we design CapsDT, a Diffusion Transformer model for capsule robot manipulation in the stomach. By processing interleaved visual inputs, and textual instructions, CapsDT can infer corresponding robotic control signals to facilitate endoscopy tasks. In addition, we developed a capsule endoscopy robot system, a capsule robot controlled by a robotic arm-held magnet, addressing different levels of four endoscopy tasks and creating corresponding capsule robot datasets within the stomach simulator. Comprehensive evaluations on various robotic tasks indicate that CapsDT can serve as a robust vision-language generalist, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various levels of endoscopy tasks while achieving a 26.25% success rate in real-world simulation manipulation.

  Vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong semantic understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet most existing systems assume an accurate low-level controller with hand-crafted action "vocabulary" such as end-effector pose or root velocity. This assumption confines prior work to quasi-static tasks and precludes the agile, whole-body behaviors required by humanoid whole-body control (WBC) tasks. To capture this gap in the literature, we start by introducing the first sim-to-real-ready, vision-language, closed-loop benchmark for humanoid WBC, comprising over 150 tasks from 10 categories. We then propose LeVERB: Latent Vision-Language-Encoded Robot Behavior, a hierarchical latent instruction-following framework for humanoid vision-language WBC, the first of its kind. At the top level, a vision-language policy learns a latent action vocabulary from synthetically rendered kinematic demonstrations; at the low level, a reinforcement-learned WBC policy consumes these latent verbs to generate dynamics-level commands. In our benchmark, LeVERB can zero-shot attain a 80% success rate on simple visual navigation tasks, and 58.5% success rate overall, outperforming naive hierarchical whole-body VLA implementation by 7.8 times.

- **[ControlVLA: Few-shot Object-centric Adaptation for Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16211)**  `arXiv:2506.16211`  `cs.RO`

  Learning real-world robotic manipulation is challenging, particularly when limited demonstrations are available. Existing methods for few-shot manipulation often rely on simulation-augmented data or pre-built modules like grasping and pose estimation, which struggle with sim-to-real gaps and lack extensibility. While large-scale imitation pre-training shows promise, adapting these general-purpose policies to specific tasks in data-scarce settings remains unexplored. To achieve this, we propose ControlVLA, a novel framework that bridges pre-trained VLA models with object-centric representations via a ControlNet-style architecture for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, to introduce object-centric conditions without overwriting prior knowledge, ControlVLA zero-initializes a set of projection layers, allowing them to gradually adapt the pre-trained manipulation policies. In real-world experiments across 6 diverse tasks, including pouring cubes and folding clothes, our method achieves a 76.7% success rate while requiring only 10-20 demonstrations -- a significant improvement over traditional approaches that require more than 100 demonstrations to achieve comparable success. Additional experiments highlight ControlVLA's extensibility to long-horizon tasks and robustness to unseen objects and backgrounds.

- **[ClutterDexGrasp: A Sim-to-Real System for General Dexterous Grasping in Cluttered Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14317)**  `arXiv:2506.14317`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes presents significant challenges due to diverse object geometries, occlusions, and potential collisions. Existing methods primarily focus on single-object grasping or grasp-pose prediction without interaction, which are insufficient for complex, cluttered scenes. Recent vision-language-action models offer a potential solution but require extensive real-world demonstrations, making them costly and difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we revisit the sim-to-real transfer pipeline and develop key techniques that enable zero-shot deployment in reality while maintaining robust generalization. We propose ClutterDexGrasp, a two-stage teacher-student framework for closed-loop target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes. The framework features a teacher policy trained in simulation using clutter density curriculum learning, incorporating both a geometry and spatially-embedded scene representation and a novel comprehensive safety curriculum, enabling general, dynamic, and safe grasping behaviors. Through imitation learning, we distill the teacher's knowledge into a student 3D diffusion policy (DP3) that operates on partial point cloud observations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first zero-shot sim-to-real closed-loop system for target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes, demonstrating robust performance across diverse objects and layouts.

- **[An Iterative Task-Driven Framework for Resilient LiDAR Place Recognition in Adverse Weather](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14806)**  `arXiv:2504.14806`  `cs.RO`

  LiDAR place recognition (LPR) plays a vital role in autonomous navigation. However, existing LPR methods struggle to maintain robustness under adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, and fog, where weather-induced noise and point cloud degradation impair LiDAR reliability and perception accuracy. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Iterative Task-Driven Framework (ITDNet), which integrates a LiDAR Data Restoration (LDR) module and a LiDAR Place Recognition (LPR) module through an iterative learning strategy. These modules are jointly trained end-to-end, with alternating optimization to enhance performance. The core rationale of ITDNet is to leverage the LDR module to recover the corrupted point clouds while preserving structural consistency with clean data, thereby improving LPR accuracy in adverse weather. Simultaneously, the LPR task provides feature pseudo-labels to guide the LDR module's training, aligning it more effectively with the LPR task. To achieve this, we first design a task-driven LPR loss and a reconstruction loss to jointly supervise the optimization of the LDR module. Furthermore, for the LDR module, we propose a Dual-Domain Mixer (DDM) block for frequency-spatial feature fusion and a Semantic-Aware Generator (SAG) block for semantic-guided restoration. In addition, for the LPR module, we introduce a Multi-Frequency Transformer (MFT) block and a Wavelet Pyramid NetVLAD (WPN) block to aggregate multi-scale, robust global descriptors. Finally, extensive experiments on Weather-KITTI, Boreas, and our proposed Weather-Apollo datasets demonstrate that, ITDNet outperforms existing LPR methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in adverse weather.

- **[SP-VLA: A Joint Model Scheduling and Token Pruning Approach for VLA Model Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12723)**  `arXiv:2506.12723`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have attracted increasing attention for their strong control capabilities. However, their high computational cost and low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result, temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves up to 1.5$\times$ acceleration with less than 3% drop in accuracy, outperforming existing approaches in multiple tasks.
