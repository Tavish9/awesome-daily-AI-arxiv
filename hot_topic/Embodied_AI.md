  Simulation-based data synthesis has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing real-world robotic manipulation. However, existing synthetic datasets remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to two challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient, scalable data generation method for novel tasks, and (2) oversimplified simulation environments that fail to capture real-world complexity. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable simulation framework that enables automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, along with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. We first construct RoboTwin-OD, a large-scale object library comprising 731 instances across 147 categories, each annotated with semantic and manipulation-relevant labels. Building on this foundation, we develop an expert data synthesis pipeline that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with simulation-in-the-loop refinement to generate task-level execution code automatically. To improve sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 incorporates structured domain randomization along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height and language instructions, thereby enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. We instantiate this framework across 50 dual-arm tasks spanning five robot embodiments, and pre-collect over 100,000 domain-randomized expert trajectories. Empirical results show a 10.9% gain in code generation success and improved generalization to novel real-world scenarios. A VLA model fine-tuned on our dataset achieves a 367% relative improvement (42.0% vs. 9.0%) on unseen scene real-world tasks, while zero-shot models trained solely on our synthetic data achieve a 228% relative gain, highlighting strong generalization without real-world supervision. We release the data generator, benchmark, dataset, and code to support scalable research in robust bimanual manipulation.

- **[RLRC: Reinforcement Learning-based Recovery for Compressed Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17639)**  `arXiv:2506.17639`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities and promising potential in solving complex robotic manipulation tasks. However, their substantial parameter sizes and high inference latency pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, particularly on resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address this issue, we begin by conducting an extensive empirical study to explore the effectiveness of model compression techniques when applied to VLAs. Building on the insights gained from these preliminary experiments, we propose RLRC, a three-stage recovery method for compressed VLAs, including structured pruning, performance recovery based on SFT and RL, and further quantization. RLRC achieves up to an 8x reduction in memory usage and a 2.3x improvement in inference throughput, while maintaining or even surpassing the original VLA's task success rate. Extensive experiments show that RLRC consistently outperforms existing compression baselines, demonstrating strong potential for on-device deployment of VLAs. Project website:this https URL

- **[HybridVLA: Collaborative Diffusion and Autoregression in a Unified Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10631)**  `arXiv:2503.10631`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`

  A fundamental objective of manipulation policy design is to endow robots to comprehend human instructions, reason about scene cues, and execute generalized actions in dynamic environments. Recent autoregressive vision-language-action (VLA) methods inherit common-sense reasoning capabilities from vision-language models (VLMs) for next action-token prediction. However, these methods quantize actions into discrete bins, which disrupts the continuity required for precise control. In contrast, existing diffusion-based VLA methods incorporate an additional diffusion head to predict continuous actions solely conditioned on feature representations extracted by the VLM, without fully leveraging the VLM's pretrained reasoning capabilities through token-level generation. To address these limitations, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that absorbs the continuous nature of diffusion-based actions and the contextual reasoning of autoregression within a single large language model. To mitigate interference between the two generation paradigms, we propose a collaborative training recipe that seamlessly incorporates diffusion denoising into the next-token prediction process. With this recipe, we find these two action prediction methods not only reinforce each other but also exhibit varying strength across different tasks. Therefore, we design a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses both predictions, leading to more robust control. HybridVLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 14\% and 19\% in mean success rate on simulation and real-world tasks, respectively, while demonstrating stable manipulation in unseen configurations.

  Recent studies on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shifted from the end-to-end action-generation paradigm toward a pipeline involving task planning followed by action generation, demonstrating improved performance on various complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches vary significantly in terms of network architectures, planning paradigms, representations, and training data sources, making it challenging for researchers to identify the precise sources of performance gains and components to be further improved. To systematically investigate the impacts of different planning paradigms and representations isolating from network architectures and training data, in this paper, we introduce VLA-OS, a unified VLA architecture series capable of various task planning paradigms, and design a comprehensive suite of controlled experiments across diverse object categories (rigid and deformable), visual modalities (2D and 3D), environments (simulation and real-world), and end-effectors (grippers and dexterous hands). Our results demonstrate that: 1) visually grounded planning representations are generally better than language planning representations; 2) the Hierarchical-VLA paradigm generally achieves superior or comparable performance than other paradigms on task performance, pretraining, generalization ability, scalability, and continual learning ability, albeit at the cost of slower training and inference speeds.
