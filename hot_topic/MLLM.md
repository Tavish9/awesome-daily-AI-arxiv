- **[PASG: A Closed-Loop Framework for Automated Geometric Primitive Extraction and Semantic Anchoring in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05976)**  `arXiv:2508.05976`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`

  The fragmentation between high-level task semantics and low-level geometric features remains a persistent challenge in robotic manipulation. While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating affordance-aware visual representations, the lack of semantic grounding in canonical spaces and reliance on manual annotations severely limit their ability to capture dynamic semantic-affordance relationships. To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware Semantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1) Automatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling cross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic anchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional affordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning benchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's effectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios, achieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a finer-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a unified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in robotic manipulation.

- **[Effective Training Data Synthesis for Improving MLLM Chart Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06492)**  `arXiv:2508.06492`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`

  Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer (QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring 250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at:this https URL.

- **[INS-MMBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating LVLMs' Performance in Insurance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09105)**  `arXiv:2406.09105`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Chenwei Lin, Hanjia Lyu, Xian Xu, Jiebo Luo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various general multimodal applications and have shown increasing promise in specialized domains. However, their potential in the insurance domain-characterized by diverse application scenarios and rich multimodal data-remains largely underexplored. To date, there is no systematic review of multimodal tasks, nor a benchmark specifically designed to assess the capabilities of LVLMs in insurance. This gap hinders the development of LVLMs within the insurance industry. This study systematically reviews and categorizes multimodal tasks for 4 representative types of insurance: auto, property, health, and agricultural. We introduce INS-MMBench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for the insurance domain. INS-MMBench encompasses 22 fundamental tasks, 12 meta-tasks and 5 scenario tasks, enabling a comprehensive and progressive assessment from basic capabilities to real-world use cases. We benchmark 11 leading LVLMs, including closed-source models such as GPT-4o and open-source models like LLaVA. Our evaluation validates the effectiveness of INS-MMBench and offers detailed insights into the strengths and limitations of current LVLMs on a variety of insurance-related multimodal tasks. We hope that INS-MMBench will accelerate the integration of LVLMs into the insurance industry and foster interdisciplinary research. Our dataset and evaluation code are available atthis https URL.

- **[Bifrost-1: Bridging Multimodal LLMs and Diffusion Models with Patch-level CLIP Latents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05954)**  `arXiv:2508.05954`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder. These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our design choices.

- **[SIFThinker: Spatially-Aware Image Focus for Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06259)**  `arXiv:2508.06259`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however, they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

- **[LoRA in LoRA: Towards Parameter-Efficient Architecture Expansion for Continual Visual Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06202)**  `arXiv:2508.06202`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Chang Che, Ziqi Wang, Pengwan Yang, Qi Wang, Hui Ma, Zenglin Shi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual Visual Instruction Tuning (CVIT) enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks over time. However, this process is challenged by catastrophic forgetting, where performance on previously learned tasks deteriorates as the model adapts to new ones. A common approach to mitigate forgetting is architecture expansion, which introduces task-specific modules to prevent interference. Yet, existing methods often expand entire layers for each task, leading to significant parameter overhead and poor scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA (LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in MLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy, applies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize task-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss to preserve consistency in shared representations over time. Extensive experiments on a diverse CVIT benchmark show that LiLoRA consistently achieves superior performance in sequential task learning while significantly improving parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.

  Evaluating the abilities of large models and manifesting their gaps are challenging. Current benchmarks adopt either ground-truth-based score-form evaluation on static datasets or indistinct textual chatbot-style human preferences collection, which may not provide users with immediate, intuitive, and perceptible feedback on performance differences. In this paper, we introduce BioMotion Arena, a novel framework for evaluating large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via visual animation. Our methodology draws inspiration from the inherent visual perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms that utilizes point-light source imaging to amplify the performance discrepancies between models. Specifically, we employ a pairwise comparison evaluation and collect more than 45k votes for 53 mainstream LLMs and MLLMs on 90 biological motion variants. Data analyses show that the crowd-sourced human votes are in good agreement with those of expert raters, demonstrating the superiority of our BioMotion Arena in offering discriminative feedback. We also find that over 90\% of evaluated models, including the cutting-edge open-source InternVL3 and proprietary Claude-4 series, fail to produce fundamental humanoid point-light groups, much less smooth and biologically plausible motions. This enables BioMotion Arena to serve as a challenging benchmark for performance visualization and a flexible evaluation framework without restrictions on ground-truth.

- **[Fourier-VLM: Compressing Vision Tokens in the Frequency Domain for Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06038)**  `arXiv:2508.06038`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Huanyu Wang, Jushi Kai, Haoli Bai, Lu Hou, Bo Jiang, Ziwei He, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image placeholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM). However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$, minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2% compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.

- **[ART: Adaptive Relation Tuning for Generalized Relation Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23543)**  `arXiv:2507.23543`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Gopika Sudhakaran, Hikaru Shindo, Patrick Schramowski, Simone Schaub-Meyer, Kristian Kersting, Stefan Roth_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained. While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations. We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations for segmenting complex scenes.

- **[M$^2$IV: Towards Efficient and Fine-grained Multimodal In-Context Learning via Representation Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04633)**  `arXiv:2504.04633`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yanshu Li, Yi Cao, Hongyang He, Qisen Cheng, Xiang Fu, Xi Xiao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) equips Large Vision-language Models (LVLMs) with the ability to adapt to new tasks via multiple user-provided demonstrations, without requiring any model parameter updates. However, its effectiveness is constrained by the token-intensive nature of multimodal inputs and the complexity of cross-modal few-shot reasoning, which together hinder LVLMs from extracting useful patterns from demonstrations. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{M$^2$IV}, a novel representation engineering approach that replaces explicit token-level demonstrations with a set of learnable Multimodal In-context Vectors directly injected into the residual streams of LVLMs. By analyzing the distinct roles of multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) in the ICL process, we design a training strategy that enables M$^2$IV to perform fine-grained semantic distillation and robust cross-modal representation learning. M$^2$IV not only improves performance across diverse tasks and LVLMs but also significantly reduces token overhead, enabling graceful scaling to many-shot scenarios. To further enhance usability, we introduce \textbf{VLibrary}, a repository that stores trained M$^2$IVs for flexible retrieval and injection. With VLibrary, users can steer pre-trained LVLMs in a customized manner that meets diverse requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that M$^2$IV consistently outperforms vanilla ICL and prior representation engineering baselines, achieving an average accuracy gain of 3.74\% with substantial improvements in overall efficiency.

- **[Aligning Effective Tokens with Video Anomaly in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06350)**  `arXiv:2508.06350`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yingxian Chen, Jiahui Liu, Ruifan Di, Yanwei Li, Chirui Chang, Shizhen Zhao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding abnormal events in videos is a vital and challenging task that has garnered significant attention in a wide range of applications. Although current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.

- **[Uncertainty-quantified Rollout Policy Adaptation for Unlabelled Cross-domain Temporal Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06317)**  `arXiv:2508.06317`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jian Hu, Zixu Cheng, Shaogang Gong, Isabel Guan, Jianye Hao, Jun Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video Temporal Grounding (TG) aims to temporally locate video segments matching a natural language description (a query) in a long video. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are effective at holistic semantic matching, they often struggle with fine-grained temporal localisation. Recently, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) reformulates the inference process as a reinforcement learning task, enabling fine-grained grounding and achieving strong in-domain performance. However, GRPO relies on labelled data, making it unsuitable in unlabelled domains. Moreover, because videos are large and expensive to store and process, performing full-scale adaptation introduces prohibitive latency and computational overhead, making it impractical for real-time deployment. To overcome both problems, we introduce a Data-Efficient Unlabelled Cross-domain Temporal Grounding method, from which a model is first trained on a labelled source domain, then adapted to a target domain using only a small number of unlabelled videos from the target domain. This approach eliminates the need for target annotation and keeps both computational and storage overhead low enough to run in real time. Specifically, we introduce. Uncertainty-quantified Rollout Policy Adaptation (URPA) for cross-domain knowledge transfer in learning video temporal grounding without target labels. URPA generates multiple candidate predictions using GRPO rollouts, averages them to form a pseudo label, and estimates confidence from the variance across these rollouts. This confidence then weights the training rewards, guiding the model to focus on reliable supervision. Experiments on three datasets across six cross-domain settings show that URPA generalises well using only a few unlabelled target videos. Codes will be released once published.

  _Hanqing Wang, Yuan Tian, Mingyu Liu, Zhenhao Zhang, Xiangyang Zhu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the rapidly evolving landscape of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the safety concerns of their outputs have earned significant attention. Although numerous datasets have been proposed, they may become outdated with MLLM advancements and are susceptible to data contamination issues. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{SDEval}, the \textit{first} safety dynamic evaluation framework to controllably adjust the distribution and complexity of safety benchmarks. Specifically, SDEval mainly adopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to generate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual effects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that injecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely, injecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is general enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability benchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and capability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly influences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety limitations of MLLMs. Code is available atthis https URL

- **[Q-CLIP: Unleashing the Power of Vision-Language Models for Video Quality Assessment through Unified Cross-Modal Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06092)**  `arXiv:2508.06092`  `cs.CV`

  Accurate and efficient Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has long been a key research challenge. Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve performance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this strategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic knowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality depends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics); (2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational resources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training directly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and have begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this work, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP enhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal Adapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters and is the only component that requires training. This design significantly reduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable quality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality variations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies on VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to better generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.

- **[AdaptInfer: Adaptive Token Pruning for Vision-Language Model Inference with Dynamical Text Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06084)**  `arXiv:2508.06084`  `cs.CV`  
  _Weichen Zhang, Zhui Zhu, Ningbo Li, Kebin Liu, Yunhao Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on multimodal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA), but their inference cost remains a significant challenge due to the large number of vision tokens processed during the prefill stage. Existing pruning methods often rely on directly using the attention patterns or static text prompt guidance, failing to exploit the dynamic internal signals generated during inference. To address these issues, we propose AdaptInfer, a plug-and-play framework for adaptive vision token pruning in VLMs. First, we introduce a fine-grained, dynamic text-guided pruning mechanism that reuses layer-wise text-to-text attention maps to construct soft priors over text-token importance, allowing more informed scoring of vision tokens at each stage. Second, we perform an offline analysis of cross-modal attention shifts and identify consistent inflection locations in inference, which inspire us to propose a more principled and efficient pruning schedule. Our method is lightweight and plug-and-play, also generalizable across multi-modal tasks. Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, it reduces CUDA latency by 61.3\% while maintaining an average accuracy of 92.9\% on vanilla LLaVA-1.5-7B. Under the same token budget, AdaptInfer surpasses SOTA in accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present our solution for the semi-supervised learning track (MER-SEMI) in MER2025. We propose a comprehensive framework, grounded in the principle that "more is better," to construct a robust Mixture of Experts (MoE) emotion recognition system. Our approach integrates a diverse range of input modalities as independent experts, including novel signals such as knowledge from large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and temporal Action Unit (AU) information. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a consensus-based pseudo-labeling strategy, generating high-quality labels from the agreement between a baseline model and Gemini, which are then used in a two-stage training paradigm. Finally, we employ a multi-expert voting ensemble combined with a rule-based re-ranking process to correct prediction bias and better align the outputs with human preferences. Evaluated on the MER2025-SEMI challenge dataset, our method achieves an F1-score of 0.8772 on the test set, ranking 2nd in the track. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual mathematical reasoning across various existing benchmarks. However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or processed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by real-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address this gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising 2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in authentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text and visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three primary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and irrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14 subcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability categories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three difficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we design six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their performance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the problem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in realistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis of their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their recognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining directions for future improvements.

- **[ETTA: Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models through Dynamic Embedding Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05898)**  `arXiv:2508.05898`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hamidreza Dastmalchi, Aijun An, Ali cheraghian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot performance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test data in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning, training-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However, current cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence samples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the influence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that integrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision boundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating contextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and computational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to reduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting optimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores from both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary strengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses the state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy, setting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation. The code has been released atthis https URL.

- **[VISTA: Vision-Language Imitation of Situational Thinking and Attention for Human-Like Driver Focus in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05852)**  `arXiv:2508.05852`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kaiser Hamid, Khandakar Ashrafi Akbar, Nade Liang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Driver visual attention prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Most prior studies focus on estimating attention allocation at a single moment in time, typically using static RGB images such as driving scene pictures. In this work, we propose a vision-language framework that models the changing landscape of drivers' gaze through natural language, using few-shot and zero-shot learning on single RGB images. We curate and refine high-quality captions from the BDD-A dataset using human-in-the-loop feedback, then fine-tune LLaVA to align visual perception with attention-centric scene understanding. Our approach integrates both low-level cues and top-down context (e.g., route semantics, risk anticipation), enabling language-based descriptions of gaze behavior. We evaluate performance across training regimes (few shot, and one-shot) and introduce domain-specific metrics for semantic alignment and response diversity. Results show that our fine-tuned model outperforms general-purpose VLMs in attention shift detection and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to generate driver visual attention allocation and shifting predictions in natural language, offering a new direction for explainable AI in autonomous driving. Our approach provides a foundation for downstream tasks such as behavior forecasting, human-AI teaming, and multi-agent coordination.

- **[Your other Left! Vision-Language Models Fail to Identify Relative Positions in Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00549)**  `arXiv:2508.00549`  `cs.CV`  
  _Daniel Wolf, Heiko Hillenhagen, Billurvan Taskin, Alex B√§uerle, Meinrad Beer, Michael G√∂tz, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Clinical decision-making relies heavily on understanding relative positions of anatomical structures and anomalies. Therefore, for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately determine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite. Despite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To address this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o, Llama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this fundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we investigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers placed on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers provide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical images compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest that, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on actual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading to incorrect conclusions. To facilitate further research in this area, we introduce the MIRP , Medical Imaging Relative Positioning, benchmark dataset, designed to systematically evaluate the capability to identify relative positions in medical images.

  Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in perception and reasoning. However, the ability to perform causal inference -- a core aspect of human cognition -- remains underexplored, particularly in multimodal settings. In this study, we introduce InfoCausalQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate causal reasoning grounded in infographics that combine structured visual data with textual context. The benchmark comprises two tasks: Task 1 focuses on quantitative causal reasoning based on inferred numerical trends, while Task 2 targets semantic causal reasoning involving five types of causal relations: cause, effect, intervention, counterfactual, and temporal. We manually collected 494 infographic-text pairs from four public sources and used GPT-4o to generate 1,482 high-quality multiple-choice QA pairs. These questions were then carefully revised by humans to ensure they cannot be answered based on surface-level cues alone but instead require genuine visual grounding. Our experimental results reveal that current VLMs exhibit limited capability in computational reasoning and even more pronounced limitations in semantic causal reasoning. Their significantly lower performance compared to humans indicates a substantial gap in leveraging infographic-based information for causal inference. Through InfoCausalQA, we highlight the need for advancing the causal reasoning abilities of multimodal AI systems.

  The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has propelled the development of autonomous agents that operate on Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) using pure visual input. A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding natural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which accurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a correct semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally appropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these MLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment, which prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address this exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization (AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer generation strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a theoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from first principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B and InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative improvements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks designed to test generalization and semantic understanding.

  Geometry problem solving (GPS) requires models to master diagram comprehension, logical reasoning, knowledge application, numerical computation, and auxiliary line construction. This presents a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLM geometry skills overlook auxiliary line construction and lack fine-grained process evaluation, making them insufficient for assessing MLLMs' long-step reasoning abilities. To bridge these gaps, we present the GeoLaux benchmark, comprising 2,186 geometry problems, incorporating both calculation and proving questions. Notably, the problems require an average of 6.51 reasoning steps, with a maximum of 24 steps, and 41.8% of them need auxiliary line construction. Building on the dataset, we design a novel five-dimensional evaluation strategy assessing answer correctness, process correctness, process quality, auxiliary line impact, and error causes. Extensive experiments on 13 leading MLLMs (including thinking models and non-thinking models) yield three pivotal findings: First, models exhibit substantial performance degradation in extended reasoning steps (nine models demonstrate over 50% performance drop). Second, compared to calculation problems, MLLMs tend to take shortcuts when solving proving problems. Third, models lack auxiliary line awareness, and enhancing this capability proves particularly beneficial for overall geometry reasoning improvement. These findings establish GeoLaux as both a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' long-step geometric reasoning with auxiliary lines and a guide for capability advancement. Our dataset and code are included in supplementary materials and will be released.

  Complex medical decision-making involves cooperative workflows operated by different clinicians. Designing AI multi-agent systems can expedite and augment human-level clinical decision-making. Existing multi-agent researches primarily focus on language-only tasks, yet their extension to multimodal scenarios remains challenging. A blind combination of diverse vision-language models (VLMs) can amplify an erroneous outcome interpretation. VLMs in general are less capable in instruction following and importantly self-reflection, compared to large language models (LLMs) of comparable sizes. This disparity largely constrains VLMs' ability in cooperative workflows. In this study, we propose MedOrch, a mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration framework for medical multimodal decision-making. MedOrch employs an LLM-based mediator agent that enables multiple VLM-based expert agents to exchange and reflect on their outputs towards collaboration. We utilize multiple open-source general-purpose and domain-specific VLMs instead of costly GPT-series models, revealing the strength of heterogeneous models. We show that the collaboration within distinct VLM-based agents can surpass the capabilities of any individual agent. We validate our approach on five medical vision question answering benchmarks, demonstrating superior collaboration performance without model training. Our findings underscore the value of mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration in advancing medical multimodal intelligence. Our code will be made publicly available.
