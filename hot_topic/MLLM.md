- **[EdgeVLA: Efficient Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14049)**  `arXiv:2507.14049`  `cs.RO` `cs.CL`

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising approach to address the data scarcity challenge in robotics, enabling the development of generalizable visuomotor control policies. While models like OpenVLA showcase the potential of this paradigm, deploying large-scale VLMs on resource-constrained mobile manipulation systems remains a significant hurdle. This paper introduces Edge VLA (EVLA), a novel approach designed to significantly enhance the inference speed of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. EVLA maintains the representational power of these models while enabling real-time performance on edge devices. We achieve this through two key innovations: 1) Eliminating the autoregressive requirement for end-effector position prediction, leading to a 7x speedup in inference, and 2) Leveraging the efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs), demonstrating comparable training performance to larger models with significantly reduced computational demands. Our early results demonstrate that EVLA achieves comparable training characteristics to OpenVLA while offering substantial gains in inference speed and memory efficiency.

- **[COREVQA: A Crowd Observation and Reasoning Entailment Visual Question Answering Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13405)**  `arXiv:2507.13405`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, many benchmarks and datasets have been developed to evaluate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using visual question answering (VQA) pairs, and models have shown significant accuracy improvements. However, these benchmarks rarely test the model's ability to accurately complete visual entailment, for instance, accepting or refuting a hypothesis based on the image. To address this, we propose COREVQA (Crowd Observations and Reasoning Entailment), a benchmark of 5608 image and synthetically generated true/false statement pairs, with images derived from the CrowdHuman dataset, to provoke visual entailment reasoning on challenging crowded images. Our results show that even the top-performing VLMs achieve accuracy below 80%, with other models performing substantially worse (39.98%-69.95%). This significant performance gap reveals key limitations in VLMs' ability to reason over certain types of image-question pairs in crowded scenes.

- **[Teaching Vision-Language Models to Ask: Resolving Ambiguity in Visual Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13773)**  `arXiv:2507.13773`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Pu Jian, Donglei Yu, Wen Yang, Shuo Ren, Jiajun Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In visual question answering (VQA) context, users often pose ambiguous questions to visual language models (VLMs) due to varying expression habits. Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions. These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However, research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1) Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA scenarios.

- **[Enhancing Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompting and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13362)**  `arXiv:2507.13362`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Binbin Ji, Siddharth Agrawal, Qiance Tang, Yvonne Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study investigates the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement learning. We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies and find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step before the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's original performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning accuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and evaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates superior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular, we find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade performance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from "closer to" to "farther from"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable performance under such shifts. Our findings provide insights into how reinforcement learning and structured prompting improve the spatial reasoning capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. All code is open source at:this https URL

- **[On Pre-training of Multimodal Language Models Customized for Chart Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14506)**  `arXiv:2407.14506`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Wan-Cyuan Fan, Yen-Chun Chen, Mengchen Liu, Lu Yuan, Leonid Sigal_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies customizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for domain-specific tasks have yielded promising results, especially in the field of scientific chart comprehension. These studies generally utilize visual instruction tuning with specialized datasets to enhance question and answer (QA) accuracy within the chart domain. However, they often neglect the fundamental discrepancy between natural image-caption pre-training data and digital chart image-QA data, particularly in the models' capacity to extract underlying numeric values from charts. This paper tackles this oversight by exploring the training processes necessary to improve MLLMs' comprehension of charts. We present three key findings: (1) Incorporating raw data values in alignment pre-training markedly improves comprehension of chart data. (2) Replacing images with their textual representation randomly during end-to-end fine-tuning transfer the language reasoning capability to chart interpretation skills. (3) Requiring the model to first extract the underlying chart data and then answer the question in the fine-tuning can further improve the accuracy. Consequently, we introduce CHOPINLLM, an MLLM tailored for in-depth chart comprehension. CHOPINLLM effectively interprets various types of charts, including unannotated ones, while maintaining robust reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of different chart types across various comprehension levels. Experimental results show that CHOPINLLM exhibits strong performance in understanding both annotated and unannotated charts across a wide range of types.

- **[When Seeing Overrides Knowing: Disentangling Knowledge Conflicts in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13868)**  `arXiv:2507.13868`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Francesco Ortu, Zhijing Jin, Diego Doimo, Alberto Cazzaniga_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly leverage diverse knowledge sources to address complex tasks, often encountering conflicts between their internal parametric knowledge and external information. Knowledge conflicts can result in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual overrides, outperforming gradient-based attribution in precision.

- **[Team of One: Cracking Complex Video QA with Model Synergy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13820)**  `arXiv:2507.13820`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel framework for open-ended video question answering that enhances reasoning depth and robustness in complex real-world scenarios, as benchmarked on the CVRR-ES dataset. Existing Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs) often exhibit limited contextual understanding, weak temporal modeling, and poor generalization to ambiguous or compositional queries. To address these challenges, we introduce a prompting-and-response integration mechanism that coordinates multiple heterogeneous Video-Language Models (VLMs) via structured chains of thought, each tailored to distinct reasoning pathways. An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator, selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across all evaluation metrics, showcasing superior generalization and robustness. Our approach offers a lightweight, extensible strategy for advancing multimodal reasoning without requiring model retraining, setting a strong foundation for future Video-LMM development.

- **["PhyWorldBench": A Comprehensive Evaluation of Physical Realism in Text-to-Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13428)**  `arXiv:2507.13428`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in creating high-quality, photorealistic content. However, their ability to accurately simulate physical phenomena remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This paper presents PhyWorldBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion. Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency. Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050 curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles.

  _Shmuel Berman, Jia Deng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Language Models (VLMs) excel at complex visual tasks such as VQA and chart understanding, yet recent work suggests they struggle with simple perceptual tests. We present an evaluation that tests vision-language models' capacity for nonlocal visual reasoning -- reasoning that requires chaining evidence collected from multiple, possibly distant, regions of an image. We isolate three distinct forms of non-local vision: comparative perception, which demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves searching smoothly along a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini), even those that perform well on prior primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans. Our structured evaluation suite allows us to test if VLMs can perform similar visual algorithms to humans. Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities.

- **[ZonUI-3B: A Lightweight Vision-Language Model for Cross-Resolution GUI Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23491)**  `arXiv:2506.23491`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _ZongHan Hsieh, Tzer-Jen Wei, ShengJing Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present ZonUI-3B, a lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM) that can be fully trained on a single consumer-grade GPU (RTX 4090) while delivering performance comparable to significantly larger models on GUI grounding tasks. The model incorporates several key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset of 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies, demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding benchmarks, including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights ZonUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9% on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B parameters. Ablation studies validate the critical role of balanced sampling and two-stage fine-tuning in enhancing robustness, particularly in high-resolution desktop scenarios.

- **[Moodifier: MLLM-Enhanced Emotion-Driven Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14024)**  `arXiv:2507.14024`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jiarong Ye, Sharon X. Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bridging emotions and visual content for emotion-driven image editing holds great potential in creative industries, yet precise manipulation remains challenging due to the abstract nature of emotions and their varied manifestations across different contexts. We tackle this challenge with an integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes. Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry, and home d√©cor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications. We will release the MoodArchive dataset, MoodifyCLIP model, and make the Moodifier code and demo publicly available upon acceptance.

- **[LoRA-Loop: Closing the Synthetic Replay Cycle for Continual VLM Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13568)**  `arXiv:2507.13568`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kaihong Wang, Donghyun Kim, Margrit Betke_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However, real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage, confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning (MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.

- **[How Far Have Medical Vision-Language Models Come? A Comprehensive Benchmarking Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11200)**  `arXiv:2507.11200`  `cs.CV`  
  _Che Liu, Jiazhen Pan, Weixiang Shen, Wenjia Bai, Daniel Rueckert, Rossella Arcucci_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale corpora excel at natural image tasks and are increasingly repurposed for healthcare; however, their competence in medical tasks remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive evaluation of open-source general-purpose and medically specialised VLMs, ranging from 3B to 72B parameters, across eight benchmarks: MedXpert, OmniMedVQA, PMC-VQA, PathVQA, MMMU, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD. To observe model performance across different aspects, we first separate it into understanding and reasoning components. Three salient findings emerge. First, large general-purpose models already match or surpass medical-specific counterparts on several benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot transfer from natural to medical images. Second, reasoning performance is consistently lower than understanding, highlighting a critical barrier to safe decision support. Third, performance varies widely across benchmarks, reflecting differences in task design, annotation quality, and knowledge demands. No model yet reaches the reliability threshold for clinical deployment, underscoring the need for stronger multimodal alignment and more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation protocols.

- **[GeoMag: A Vision-Language Model for Pixel-level Fine-Grained Remote Sensing Image Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05887)**  `arXiv:2507.05887`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xianzhi Ma, Jianhui Li, Changhua Pei, Hao Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) image understanding has achieved notable progress, demonstrating the basic ability to recognize and describe geographical entities. However, existing RS-VLMs are mostly limited to image-level and region-level tasks, lacking the capability to handle pixel-level tasks and performing poorly in small-object recognition scenarios. Moreover, RS-VLMs consume significant computational resources when processing high-resolution RS images, further restricting their practical applicability. In this context, we propose GeoMag (Geographical Magnifier), an end-to-end general-purpose large model framework for RS. GeoMag dynamically focuses the attention scope based on prompt semantics to effectively perform remote sensing image parsing across multiple levels of granularity. This method introduces Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC), which adaptively reduce the spatial resolution of task-irrelevant regions while enhancing the visual representation of task-relevant areas. This approach improves the model's perception of critical target regions, suppresses background redundancy, and reduces the computational cost of interpreting high-resolution RS imagery. Extensive comparative experiments on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that GeoMag not only excels in handling pixel-level tasks but also maintains competitive performance across tasks of other granularities compared to existing RS-VLMs.

- **[VFaith: Do Large Multimodal Models Really Reason on Seen Images Rather than Previous Memories?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11571)**  `arXiv:2506.11571`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jiachen Yu, Yufei Zhan, Ziheng Wu, Yousong Zhu, Jinqiao Wang, Minghui Qiu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent extensive works have demonstrated that by introducing long CoT, the capabilities of MLLMs to solve complex problems can be effectively enhanced. However, the reasons for the effectiveness of such paradigms remain unclear. It is challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's specific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning during inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore, evaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is crucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and controllable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1. It enables the automatic and precise editing of specific visual cues based on the instruction. Furthermore, we introduce VFaith-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' visual reasoning capabilities and analyze the source of such capabilities with an emphasis on the visual faithfulness. Using the designed pipeline, we constructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in images that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby changing the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that have different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual reasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing the test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's reasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics to expose this relationship. VFaith-Bench includes 755 entries divided into five distinct subsets, along with an additional human-labeled perception task. We conducted in-depth testing and analysis of existing mainstream flagship models and prominent open-source model series/reasoning models on VFaith-Bench, further investigating the underlying factors of their reasoning capabilities.

- **[Innocence in the Crossfire: Roles of Skip Connections in Jailbreaking Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13761)**  `arXiv:2507.13761`  `cs.CL`  
  _Palash Nandi, Maithili Joshi, Tanmoy Chakraborty_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models are highly sensitive to prompt formulations - small changes in input can drastically alter their output. This raises a critical question: To what extent can prompt sensitivity be exploited to generate inapt content? In this paper, we investigate how discrete components of prompt design influence the generation of inappropriate content in Visual Language Models (VLMs). Specifically, we analyze the impact of three key factors on successful jailbreaks: (a) the inclusion of detailed visual information, (b) the presence of adversarial examples, and (c) the use of positively framed beginning phrases. Our findings reveal that while a VLM can reliably distinguish between benign and harmful inputs in unimodal settings (text-only or image-only), this ability significantly degrades in multimodal contexts. Each of the three factors is independently capable of triggering a jailbreak, and we show that even a small number of in-context examples (as few as three) can push the model toward generating inappropriate outputs. Furthermore, we propose a framework that utilizes a skip-connection between two internal layers of the VLM, which substantially increases jailbreak success rates, even when using benign images. Finally, we demonstrate that memes, often perceived as humorous or harmless, can be as effective as toxic visuals in eliciting harmful content, underscoring the subtle and complex vulnerabilities of VLMs.
