  Operating robots in open-ended scenarios with diverse tasks is a crucial research and application direction in robotics. While recent progress in natural language processing and large multimodal models has enhanced robots' ability to understand complex instructions, robot manipulation still faces the procedural skill dilemma and the declarative skill dilemma in open environments. Existing methods often compromise cognitive and executive capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose RoBridge, a hierarchical intelligent architecture for general robotic manipulation. It consists of a high-level cognitive planner (HCP) based on a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), an invariant operable representation (IOR) serving as a symbolic bridge, and a generalist embodied agent (GEA). RoBridge maintains the declarative skill of VLM and unleashes the procedural skill of reinforcement learning, effectively bridging the gap between cognition and execution. RoBridge demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines, achieving a 75% success rate on new tasks and an 83% average success rate in sim-to-real generalization using only five real-world data samples per task. This work represents a significant step towards integrating cognitive reasoning with physical execution in robotic systems, offering a new paradigm for general robotic manipulation.

- **[Towards Efficient Online Tuning of VLM Agents via Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03792)**  `arXiv:2505.03792`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  Online fine-tuning vision-language model (VLM) agents with reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise for equipping agents with multi-step, goal-oriented capabilities in dynamic environments. However, their open-ended textual action space and non-end-to-end nature of action generation present significant challenges to effective online exploration in RL, e.g., explosion of the exploration space. We propose a novel online fine-tuning method, Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning (CoSo), better suited to the textual output space of VLM agents. Compared to prior methods that assign uniform uncertainty to all tokens, CoSo leverages counterfactual reasoning to dynamically assess the causal influence of individual tokens on post-processed actions. By prioritizing the exploration of action-critical tokens while reducing the impact of semantically redundant or low-impact tokens, CoSo enables a more targeted and efficient online rollout process. We provide theoretical analysis proving CoSo's convergence and policy improvement guarantees, and extensive empirical evaluations supporting CoSo's effectiveness. Our results across a diverse set of agent tasks, including Android device control, card gaming, and embodied AI, highlight its remarkable ability to enhance exploration efficiency and deliver consistent performance gains.

- **[Vision-Language Model Selection and Reuse for Downstream Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18271)**  `arXiv:2501.18271`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Hao-Zhe Tan, Zhi Zhou, Yu-Feng Li, Lan-Zhe Guo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly popular across various visual tasks, and several open-sourced VLM variants have been released. However, selecting the best-performing pre-trained VLM for a specific downstream task is challenging since no single VLM can achieve promising performance on all downstream tasks, and evaluating all available VLMs is impossible due to time and data limitations. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel paradigm to select and reuse VLM for downstream tasks, called Model Label Learning (MLL). The proposal contains three key modules: \emph{model labeling}, which assigns labels to each VLM to describe their specialty and utility; \emph{model selection}, which matches the requirements of the target task with model labels; and \emph{model reuse}, which applies selected VLMs to the target task in an ensemble manner. The proposal is highly computationally efficient and growable since the model labeling process is completed target task independent and the ability could grow with the number of candidate VLMs. We also introduce a new benchmark for evaluating VLM selection methods, including 49 VLMs and 17 target task datasets. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for selecting and reusing VLMs.

- **[Vision-Language Models Create Cross-Modal Task Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22330)**  `arXiv:2410.22330`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Grace Luo, Trevor Darrell, Amir Bar_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive vision-language models (VLMs) can handle many tasks within a single model, yet the representations that enable this capability remain opaque. We find that VLMs align conceptually equivalent inputs into a shared task vector, which is invariant to modality (text, image) and format (examples, instruction), and may simplify VLM processing. We measure this alignment via cross-modal transfer -- the ability of a task vector derived in one modality to trigger the correct generation in another -- on a range of tasks and model architectures. Although the task vector is highly compressed, we find that this single vector outperforms prompting the model with the full task information, unique to this cross-modal case. Furthermore, we show that task vectors can be transferred from a base language model to its fine-tuned vision-language counterpart, and that they can be derived solely from instructions without the need for examples. Taken together, our findings shed light on how VLMs internally process task information, and how they map different modalities into common semantic representations. Project page:this https URL.

- **[LLM2CLIP: Powerful Language Model Unlocks Richer Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04997)**  `arXiv:2411.04997`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  CLIP is a foundational multimodal model that aligns image and text features into a shared representation space via contrastive learning on large-scale image-text pairs. Its effectiveness primarily stems from the use of natural language as rich supervision. Motivated by the remarkable advancements in large language models (LLMs), this work explores how LLMs' superior text understanding and extensive open-world knowledge can enhance CLIP's capability, especially for processing longer and more complex image captions. We propose an efficient post-training strategy that integrates LLMs into pretrained CLIP. To address the challenge posed by the autoregressive nature of LLMs, we introduce a caption-to-caption contrastive fine-tuning framework, significantly enhancing the discriminative quality of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms LoRA-based methods, achieving nearly fourfold faster training with superior performance. Furthermore, we validate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models such as CLIP, EVA02, and SigLip2 across various zero-shot multimodal retrieval tasks, cross-lingual retrieval tasks, and multimodal language model pretraining.

- **[Cyclic Vision-Language Manipulator: Towards Reliable and Fine-Grained Image Interpretation for Automated Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05261)**  `arXiv:2411.05261`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Yingying Fang, Zihao Jin, Shaojie Guo, Jinda Liu, Zhiling Yue, Yijian Gao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite significant advancements in automated report generation, the opaqueness of text interpretability continues to cast doubt on the reliability of the content produced. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify specific image features in X-ray images that influence the outputs of report generation models. Specifically, we propose Cyclic Vision-Language Manipulator CVLM, a module to generate a manipulated X-ray from an original X-ray and its report from a designated report generator. The essence of CVLM is that cycling manipulated X-rays to the report generator produces altered reports aligned with the alterations pre-injected into the reports for X-ray generation, achieving the term "cyclic manipulation". This process allows direct comparison between original and manipulated X-rays, clarifying the critical image features driving changes in reports and enabling model users to assess the reliability of the generated texts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CVLM can identify more precise and reliable features compared to existing explanation methods, significantly enhancing the transparency and applicability of AI-generated reports.

- **[R^3-VQA: "Read the Room" by Video Social Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04147)**  `arXiv:2505.04147`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Lixing Niu, Jiapeng Li, Xingping Yu, Shu Wang, Ruining Feng, Bo Wu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  "Read the room" is a significant social reasoning capability in human daily life. Humans can infer others' mental states from subtle social cues. Previous social reasoning tasks and datasets lack complexity (e.g., simple scenes, basic interactions, incomplete mental state variables, single-step reasoning, etc.) and fall far short of the challenges present in real-life social interactions. In this paper, we contribute a valuable, high-quality, and comprehensive video dataset named R^3-VQA with precise and fine-grained annotations of social events and mental states (i.e., belief, intent, desire, and emotion) as well as corresponding social causal chains in complex social scenarios. Moreover, we include human-annotated and model-generated QAs. Our task R^3-VQA includes three aspects: Social Event Understanding, Mental State Estimation, and Social Causal Reasoning. As a benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate the social reasoning capabilities and consistencies of current state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs). Comprehensive experiments show that (i) LVLMs are still far from human-level consistent social reasoning in complex social scenarios; (ii) Theory of Mind (ToM) prompting can help LVLMs perform better on social reasoning tasks. We provide some of our dataset and codes in supplementary material and will release our full dataset and codes upon acceptance.

- **[Beyond Recognition: Evaluating Visual Perspective Taking in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03821)**  `arXiv:2505.03821`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Gracjan G√≥ral, Alicja Ziarko, Piotr Mi≈Ço≈õ, Micha≈Ç Nauman, Maciej Wo≈Çczyk, Micha≈Ç Kosi≈Ñski_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate the ability of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to perform visual perspective taking using a novel set of visual tasks inspired by established human tests. Our approach leverages carefully controlled scenes, in which a single humanoid minifigure is paired with a single object. By systematically varying spatial configurations - such as object position relative to the humanoid minifigure and the humanoid minifigure's orientation - and using both bird's-eye and surface-level views, we created 144 unique visual tasks. Each visual task is paired with a series of 7 diagnostic questions designed to assess three levels of visual cognition: scene understanding, spatial reasoning, and visual perspective taking. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, and variants of Claude Sonnet, reveals that while they excel in scene understanding, the performance declines significantly on spatial reasoning and further deteriorates on perspective-taking. Our analysis suggests a gap between surface-level object recognition and the deeper spatial and perspective reasoning required for complex visual tasks, pointing to the need for integrating explicit geometric representations and tailored training protocols in future VLM development.

- **[On Path to Multimodal Generalist: General-Level and General-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04620)**  `arXiv:2505.04620`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hao Fei, Yuan Zhou, Juncheng Li, Xiangtai Li, Qingshan Xu, Bobo Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) is currently experiencing rapid growth, driven by the advanced capabilities of LLMs. Unlike earlier specialists, existing MLLMs are evolving towards a Multimodal Generalist paradigm. Initially limited to understanding multiple modalities, these models have advanced to not only comprehend but also generate across modalities. Their capabilities have expanded from coarse-grained to fine-grained multimodal understanding and from supporting limited modalities to arbitrary ones. While many benchmarks exist to assess MLLMs, a critical question arises: Can we simply assume that higher performance across tasks indicates a stronger MLLM capability, bringing us closer to human-level AI? We argue that the answer is not as straightforward as it seems. This project introduces General-Level, an evaluation framework that defines 5-scale levels of MLLM performance and generality, offering a methodology to compare MLLMs and gauge the progress of existing systems towards more robust multimodal generalists and, ultimately, towards AGI. At the core of the framework is the concept of Synergy, which measures whether models maintain consistent capabilities across comprehension and generation, and across multiple modalities. To support this evaluation, we present General-Bench, which encompasses a broader spectrum of skills, modalities, formats, and capabilities, including over 700 tasks and 325,800 instances. The evaluation results that involve over 100 existing state-of-the-art MLLMs uncover the capability rankings of generalists, highlighting the challenges in reaching genuine AI. We expect this project to pave the way for future research on next-generation multimodal foundation models, providing a robust infrastructure to accelerate the realization of AGI.

- **[DeCLIP: Decoupled Learning for Open-Vocabulary Dense Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04410)**  `arXiv:2505.04410`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dense visual prediction tasks have been constrained by their reliance on predefined categories, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where visual concepts are unbounded. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to dense prediction often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features respectively. The ``content'' features are aligned with image crop representations to improve local discriminability, while ``context'' features learn to retain the spatial correlations under the guidance of vision foundation models, such as DINO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks, including object detection and semantic segmentation.

- **[CM1 - A Dataset for Evaluating Few-Shot Information Extraction with Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04214)**  `arXiv:2505.04214`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The automatic extraction of key-value information from handwritten documents is a key challenge in document analysis. A reliable extraction is a prerequisite for the mass digitization efforts of many archives. Large Vision Language Models (LVLM) are a promising technology to tackle this problem especially in scenarios where little annotated training data is available. In this work, we present a novel dataset specifically designed to evaluate the few-shot capabilities of LVLMs. The CM1 documents are a historic collection of forms with handwritten entries created in Europe to administer the Care and Maintenance program after World War Two. The dataset establishes three benchmarks on extracting name and birthdate information and, furthermore, considers different training set sizes. We provide baseline results for two different LVLMs and compare performances to an established full-page extraction model. While the traditional full-page model achieves highly competitive performances, our experiments show that when only a few training samples are available the considered LVLMs benefit from their size and heavy pretraining and outperform the classical approach.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Ming-Lite-Uni, an open-source multimodal framework featuring a newly designed unified visual generator and a native multimodal autoregressive model tailored for unifying vision and language. Specifically, this project provides an open-source implementation of the integrated MetaQueries and M2-omni framework, while introducing the novel multi-scale learnable tokens and multi-scale representation alignment strategy. By leveraging a fixed MLLM and a learnable diffusion model, Ming-Lite-Uni enables native multimodal AR models to perform both text-to-image generation and instruction based image editing tasks, expanding their capabilities beyond pure visual understanding. Our experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of Ming-Lite-Uni and illustrate the impressive fluid nature of its interactive process. All code and model weights are open-sourced to foster further exploration within the community. Notably, this work aligns with concurrent multimodal AI milestones - such as ChatGPT-4o with native image generation updated in March 25, 2025 - underscoring the broader significance of unified models like Ming-Lite-Uni on the path toward AGI. Ming-Lite-Uni is in alpha stage and will soon be further refined.

- **[Antidote: A Unified Framework for Mitigating LVLM Hallucinations in Counterfactual Presupposition and Object Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20468)**  `arXiv:2504.20468`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yuanchen Wu, Lu Zhang, Hang Yao, Junlong Du, Ke Yan, Shouhong Ding, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results across various cross-modal tasks. However, hallucinations, i.e., the models generating counterfactual responses, remain a challenge. Though recent studies have attempted to alleviate object perception hallucinations, they focus on the models' response generation, and overlooking the task question itself. This paper discusses the vulnerability of LVLMs in solving counterfactual presupposition questions (CPQs), where the models are prone to accept the presuppositions of counterfactual objects and produce severe hallucinatory responses. To this end, we introduce "Antidote", a unified, synthetic data-driven post-training framework for mitigating both types of hallucination above. It leverages synthetic data to incorporate factual priors into questions to achieve self-correction, and decouple the mitigation process into a preference optimization problem. Furthermore, we construct "CP-Bench", a novel benchmark to evaluate LVLMs' ability to correctly handle CPQs and produce factual responses. Applied to the LLaVA series, Antidote can simultaneously enhance performance on CP-Bench by over 50%, POPE by 1.8-3.3%, and CHAIR & SHR by 30-50%, all without relying on external supervision from stronger LVLMs or human feedback and introducing noticeable catastrophic forgetting issues.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to integrate visual and linguistic information, achieving near-human proficiency in tasks like object recognition, captioning, and visual question answering. However, current benchmarks typically focus on knowledge-centric evaluations that assess domain-specific expertise, often neglecting the core ability to reason about fundamental mathematical elements and visual concepts. We identify a gap in evaluating elementary-level math problems, which rely on explicit visual dependencies-requiring models to discern, integrate, and reason across multiple images while incorporating commonsense knowledge, all of which are crucial for advancing toward broader AGI capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VCBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal mathematical reasoning with explicit visual dependencies. VCBENCH includes 1,720 problems across six cognitive domains, featuring 6,697 images (averaging 3.9 per question) to ensure multi-image reasoning. We evaluate 26 state-of-the-art LVLMs on VCBENCH, revealing substantial performance disparities, with even the top models unable to exceed 50% accuracy. Our findings highlight the ongoing challenges in visual-mathematical integration and suggest avenues for future LVLMthis http URLproject can be found atthis https URL.

- **[DynamicControl: Adaptive Condition Selection for Improved Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03255)**  `arXiv:2412.03255`  `cs.CV`  
  _Qingdong He, Jinlong Peng, Pengcheng Xu, Boyuan Jiang, Xiaobin Hu, Donghao Luo, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To enhance the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models, current ControlNet-like models have explored various control signals to dictate image attributes. However, existing methods either handle conditions inefficiently or use a fixed number of conditions, which does not fully address the complexity of multiple conditions and their potential conflicts. This underscores the need for innovative approaches to manage multiple conditions effectively for more reliable and detailed image synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, DynamicControl, which supports dynamic combinations of diverse control signals, allowing adaptive selection of different numbers and types of conditions. Our approach begins with a double-cycle controller that generates an initial real score sorting for all input conditions by leveraging pre-trained conditional generation models and discriminative models. This controller evaluates the similarity between extracted conditions and input conditions, as well as the pixel-level similarity with the source image. Then, we integrate a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to build an efficient condition evaluator. This evaluator optimizes the ordering of conditions based on the double-cycle controller's score ranking. Our method jointly optimizes MLLMs and diffusion models, utilizing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities to facilitate multi-condition text-to-image (T2I) tasks. The final sorted conditions are fed into a parallel multi-control adapter, which learns feature maps from dynamic visual conditions and integrates them to modulate ControlNet, thereby enhancing control over generated images. Through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, DynamicControl demonstrates its superiority over existing methods in terms of controllability, generation quality and composability under various conditional controls.

- **[Is What You Ask For What You Get? Investigating Concept Associations in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04634)**  `arXiv:2410.04634`  `cs.CV`  
  _Salma S. Abdel Magid, Weiwei Pan, Simon Warchol, Grace Guo, Junsik Kim, Mahia Rahman, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly used in impactful real-life applications. As such, there is a growing need to audit these models to ensure that they generate desirable, task-appropriate images. However, systematically inspecting the associations between prompts and generated content in a human-understandable way remains challenging. To address this, we propose Concept2Concept, a framework where we characterize conditional distributions of vision language models using interpretable concepts and metrics that can be defined in terms of these concepts. This characterization allows us to use our framework to audit models and prompt-datasets. To demonstrate, we investigate several case studies of conditional distributions of prompts, such as user-defined distributions or empirical, real-world distributions. Lastly, we implement Concept2Concept as an open-source interactive visualization tool to facilitate use by non-technical end-users. A demo is available atthis https URL.
