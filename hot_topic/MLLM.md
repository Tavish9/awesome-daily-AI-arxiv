- **[GenTe: Generative Real-world Terrains for General Legged Robot Locomotion Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09997)**  `arXiv:2504.09997`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Developing bipedal robots capable of traversing diverse real-world terrains presents a fundamental robotics challenge, as existing methods using predefined height maps and static environments fail to address the complexity of unstructured landscapes. To bridge this gap, we propose GenTe, a framework for generating physically realistic and adaptable terrains to train generalizable locomotion policies. GenTe constructs an atomic terrain library that includes both geometric and physical terrains, enabling curriculum training for reinforcement learning-based locomotion policies. By leveraging function-calling techniques and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), GenTe generates complex, contextually relevant terrains from textual and graphical inputs. The framework introduces realistic force modeling for terrain interactions, capturing effects such as soil sinkage and hydrodynamic resistance. To the best of our knowledge, GenTe is the first framework that systemically generates simulation environments for legged robot locomotion control. Additionally, we introduce a benchmark of 100 generated terrains. Experiments demonstrate improved generalization and robustness in bipedal robot locomotion.

- **[LangPert: Detecting and Handling Task-level Perturbations for Robust Object Rearrangement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09893)**  `arXiv:2504.09893`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Xu Yin, Min-Sung Yoon, Yuchi Huo, Kang Zhang, Sung-Eui Yoon_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Task execution for object rearrangement could be challenged by Task-Level Perturbations (TLP), i.e., unexpected object additions, removals, and displacements that can disrupt underlying visual policies and fundamentally compromise task feasibility and progress. To address these challenges, we present LangPert, a language-based framework designed to detect and mitigate TLP situations in tabletop rearrangement tasks. LangPert integrates a Visual Language Model (VLM) to comprehensively monitor policy's skill execution and environmental TLP, while leveraging the Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (HCoT) reasoning mechanism to enhance the Large Language Model (LLM)'s contextual understanding and generate adaptive, corrective skill-execution plans. Our experimental results demonstrate that LangPert handles diverse TLP situations more effectively than baseline methods, achieving higher task completion rates, improved execution efficiency, and potential generalization to unseen scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in understanding complex language and visual data, enabling generalist robotic systems to interpret instructions and perform embodied tasks. Nevertheless, their real-world deployment is hindered by substantial computational and storage demands. Recent insights into the homogeneous patterns in the LLM layer have inspired sparsification techniques to address these challenges, such as early exit and token pruning. However, these methods often neglect the critical role of the final layers that encode the semantic information most relevant to downstream robotic tasks. Aligning with the recent breakthrough of the Shallow Brain Hypothesis (SBH) in neuroscience and the mixture of experts in model sparsification, we conceptualize each LLM layer as an expert and propose a Mixture-of-Layers Vision-Language-Action model (MoLe-VLA, or simply MoLe) architecture for dynamic LLM layer activation. We introduce a Spatial-Temporal Aware Router (STAR) for MoLe to selectively activate only parts of the layers based on the robot's current state, mimicking the brain's distinct signal pathways specialized for cognition and causal reasoning. Additionally, to compensate for the cognitive ability of LLMs lost in MoLe, we devise a Cognition Self-Knowledge Distillation (CogKD) framework. CogKD enhances the understanding of task demands and improves the generation of task-relevant action sequences by leveraging cognitive features. Extensive experiments conducted in both RLBench simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the superiority of MoLe-VLA in both efficiency and performance. Specifically, MoLe-VLA achieves an 8% improvement in the mean success rate across ten tasks while reducing computational costs by up to x5.6 compared to standard LLMs.

- **[KeyMPs: One-Shot Vision-Language Guided Motion Generation by Sequencing DMPs for Occlusion-Rich Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10011)**  `arXiv:2504.10011`  `cs.RO`  
  _Edgar Anarossi, Yuhwan Kwon, Hirotaka Tahara, Shohei Tanaka, Keisuke Shirai, Masashi Hamaya, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) provide a flexible framework wherein smooth robotic motions are encoded into modular parameters. However, they face challenges in integrating multimodal inputs commonly used in robotics like vision and language into their framework. To fully maximize DMPs' potential, enabling them to handle multimodal inputs is essential. In addition, we also aim to extend DMPs' capability to handle object-focused tasks requiring one-shot complex motion generation, as observation occlusion could easily happen mid-execution in such tasks (e.g., knife occlusion in cake icing, hand occlusion in dough kneading, etc.). A promising approach is to leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which process multimodal data and can grasp high-level concepts. However, they typically lack enough knowledge and capabilities to directly infer low-level motion details and instead only serve as a bridge between high-level instructions and low-level control. To address this limitation, we propose Keyword Labeled Primitive Selection and Keypoint Pairs Generation Guided Movement Primitives (KeyMPs), a framework that combines VLMs with sequencing of DMPs. KeyMPs use VLMs' high-level reasoning capability to select a reference primitive through keyword labeled primitive selection and VLMs' spatial awareness to generate spatial scaling parameters used for sequencing DMPs by generalizing the overall motion through keypoint pairs generation, which together enable one-shot vision-language guided motion generation that aligns with the intent expressed in the multimodal input. We validate our approach through an occlusion-rich manipulation task, specifically object cutting experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, demonstrating superior performance over other DMP-based methods that integrate VLMs support.

- **[GeoNav: Empowering MLLMs with Explicit Geospatial Reasoning Abilities for Language-Goal Aerial Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09587)**  `arXiv:2504.09587`  `cs.RO`  
  _Haotian Xu, Yue Hu, Chen Gao, Zhengqiu Zhu, Yong Zhao, Yong Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language-goal aerial navigation is a critical challenge in embodied AI, requiring UAVs to localize targets in complex environments such as urban blocks based on textual specification. Existing methods, often adapted from indoor navigation, struggle to scale due to limited field of view, semantic ambiguity among objects, and lack of structured spatial reasoning. In this work, we propose GeoNav, a geospatially aware multimodal agent to enable long-range navigation. GeoNav operates in three phases-landmark navigation, target search, and precise localization-mimicking human coarse-to-fine spatial strategies. To support such reasoning, it dynamically builds two different types of spatial memory. The first is a global but schematic cognitive map, which fuses prior textual geographic knowledge and embodied visual cues into a top-down, annotated form for fast navigation to the landmark region. The second is a local but delicate scene graph representing hierarchical spatial relationships between blocks, landmarks, and objects, which is used for definite target localization. On top of this structured representation, GeoNav employs a spatially aware, multimodal chain-of-thought prompting mechanism to enable multimodal large language models with efficient and interpretable decision-making across stages. On the CityNav urban navigation benchmark, GeoNav surpasses the current state-of-the-art by up to 12.53% in success rate and significantly improves navigation efficiency, even in hard-level tasks. Ablation studies highlight the importance of each module, showcasing how geospatial representations and coarse-to-fine reasoning enhance UAV navigation.

- **[CL-CoTNav: Closed-Loop Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought for Zero-Shot Object-Goal Navigation with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09000)**  `arXiv:2504.09000`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yuxin Cai, Xiangkun He, Maonan Wang, Hongliang Guo, Wei-Yun Yau, Chen Lv_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) requires a robot to locate a target object in an unseen environment using egocentric observations. However, decision-making policies often struggle to transfer to unseen environments and novel target objects, which is the core generalization problem. Traditional end-to-end learning methods exacerbate this issue, as they rely on memorizing spatial patterns rather than employing structured reasoning, limiting their ability to generalize effectively. In this letter, we introduce Closed-Loop Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought Navigation (CL-CoTNav), a vision-language model (VLM)-driven ObjectNav framework that integrates structured reasoning and closed-loop feedback into navigation decision-making. To enhance generalization, we fine-tune a VLM using multi-turn question-answering (QA) data derived from human demonstration trajectories. This structured dataset enables hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (H-CoT) prompting, systematically extracting compositional knowledge to refine perception and decision-making, inspired by the human cognitive process of locating a target object through iterative reasoning steps. Additionally, we propose a Closed-Loop H-CoT mechanism that incorporates detection and reasoning confidence scores into training. This adaptive weighting strategy guides the model to prioritize high-confidence data pairs, mitigating the impact of noisy inputs and enhancing robustness against hallucinated or incorrect reasoning. Extensive experiments in the AI Habitat environment demonstrate CL-CoTNav's superior generalization to unseen scenes and novel object categories. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in navigation success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL) by 22.4\%. We release our datasets, models, and supplementary videos on our project page.

- **[Open-World Task and Motion Planning via Vision-Language Model Inferred Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08253)**  `arXiv:2411.08253`  `cs.RO`  
  _Nishanth Kumar, William Shen, Fabio Ramos, Dieter Fox, Tom√°s Lozano-P√©rez, Leslie Pack Kaelbling, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models trained on internet-scale data, such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), excel at performing a wide variety of common sense tasks like visual question answering. Despite their impressive capabilities, these models cannot currently be directly applied to challenging robot manipulation problems that require complex and precise continuous reasoning over long horizons. Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) systems can control high-dimensional continuous systems over long horizons via a hybrid search over traditional primitive robot skills. However, these systems require detailed models of how the robot can impact its environment, preventing them from directly interpreting and addressing novel human objectives, for example, an arbitrary natural language goal. We propose deploying VLMs within TAMP systems by having them generate discrete and continuous language-parameterized constraints that enable TAMP to reason about open-world concepts. Specifically, we propose algorithms for VLM partial planning that constrain a TAMP system's discrete temporal search and VLM continuous constraints interpretation to augment the traditional manipulation constraints that TAMP systems seek to satisfy. Experiments demonstrate that our approach -- OWL-TAMP -- outperforms several related baselines, including those that solely use TAMP or VLMs for planning, across several long-horizon manipulation tasks specified directly through natural language. We additionally demonstrate that our approach is compatible with a variety of TAMP systems and can be deployed to solve challenging manipulation tasks on real-world hardware.

- **[Reward Generation via Large Vision-Language Model in Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08772)**  `arXiv:2504.08772`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Younghwan Lee, Tung M. Luu, Donghoon Lee, Chang D. Yoo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In offline reinforcement learning (RL), learning from fixed datasets presents a promising solution for domains where real-time interaction with the environment is expensive or risky. However, designing dense reward signals for offline dataset requires significant human effort and domain expertise. Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as an alternative, but it remains costly due to the human-in-the-loop process, prompting interest in automated reward generation models. To address this, we propose Reward Generation via Large Vision-Language Models (RG-VLM), which leverages the reasoning capabilities of LVLMs to generate rewards from offline data without human involvement. RG-VLM improves generalization in long-horizon tasks and can be seamlessly integrated with the sparse reward signals to enhance task performance, demonstrating its potential as an auxiliary reward signal.

- **[Decoupling Contrastive Decoding: Robust Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08809)**  `arXiv:2504.08809`  `cs.LG`  
  _Wei Chen, Xin Yan, Bin Wen, Fan Yang, Tingting Gao, Di Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning capabilities on complex multimodal understanding tasks, they still suffer from the notorious hallucination issue: generating outputs misaligned with obvious visual or factual evidence. Currently, training-based solutions, like direct preference optimization (DPO), leverage paired preference data to suppress hallucinations. However, they risk sacrificing general reasoning capabilities due to the likelihood displacement. Meanwhile, training-free solutions, like contrastive decoding, achieve this goal by subtracting the estimated hallucination pattern from a distorted input. Yet, these handcrafted perturbations (e.g., add noise to images) may poorly capture authentic hallucination patterns. To avoid these weaknesses of existing methods, and realize robust hallucination mitigation (i.e., maintaining general reasoning performance), we propose a novel framework: Decoupling Contrastive Decoding (DCD). Specifically, DCD decouples the learning of positive and negative samples in preference datasets, and trains separate positive and negative image projections within the MLLM. The negative projection implicitly models real hallucination patterns, which enables vision-aware negative images in the contrastive decoding inference stage. Our DCD alleviates likelihood displacement by avoiding pairwise optimization and generalizes robustly without handcrafted degradation. Extensive ablations across hallucination benchmarks and general reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of DCD, i.e., it matches DPO's hallucination suppression while preserving general capabilities and outperforms the handcrafted contrastive decoding methods.

- **[Probing Visual Language Priors in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00569)**  `arXiv:2501.00569`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Tiange Luo, Ang Cao, Gunhee Lee, Justin Johnson, Honglak Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), they may over-rely on visual language priors existing in their training data rather than true visual reasoning. To investigate this, we introduce ViLP, a benchmark featuring deliberately out-of-distribution images synthesized via image generation models and out-of-distribution Q&A pairs. Each question in ViLP is coupled with three potential answers and three corresponding images: one that can be resolved by text priors alone and two that demand visual reasoning. Although, humans achieve near-perfect accuracy, modern VLMs falter; for instance, GPT-4 achieves only 66.17% on ViLP. To alleviate this, we propose a self-improving framework in which models generate new VQA data, then apply pixel-level and semantic corruptions to form "good-bad" image pairs for self-training. Our training objectives compel VLMs to focus more on the actual visual inputs, and we demonstrate their effectiveness in boosting the performance of open-source VLMs, including LLaVA-v1.5 and Cambrian.

  Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence. However, visual reasoning, reasoning involving both visual and textual inputs, remains underexplored. Recent advancements, including the reasoning models like OpenAI o1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, which incorporate image inputs, have opened this capability. In this ongoing work, we focus specifically on photography-related tasks because a photo is a visual snapshot of the physical world where the underlying physics (i.e., illumination, blur extent, etc.) interplay with the camera parameters. Successfully reasoning from the visual information of a photo to identify these numerical camera settings requires the MLLMs to have a deeper understanding of the underlying physics for precise visual comprehension, representing a challenging and intelligent capability essential for practical applications like photography assistant agents. We aim to evaluate MLLMs on their ability to distinguish visual differences related to numerical camera settings, extending a methodology previously proposed for vision-language models (VLMs). Our preliminary results demonstrate the importance of visual reasoning in photography-related tasks. Moreover, these results show that no single MLLM consistently dominates across all evaluation tasks, demonstrating ongoing challenges and opportunities in developing MLLMs with better visual reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process visual and textual information in multiple formats: texts, images, interleaved texts and images, or even hour-long videos. In this work, we conduct fine-grained quantitative and qualitative analyses of automatic summarization of multimodal presentations using VLMs with various representations as input. From these experiments, we suggest cost-effective strategies for generating summaries from text-heavy multimodal documents under different input-length budgets using VLMs. We show that slides extracted from the video stream can be beneficially used as input against the raw video, and that a structured representation from interleaved slides and transcript provides the best performance. Finally, we reflect and comment on the nature of cross-modal interactions in multimodal presentations and share suggestions to improve the capabilities of VLMs to understand documents of this nature.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently DeepSeek R1 has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a simple yet effective design. The core of R1 lies in its rule-based reward formulation, which leverages tasks with deterministic ground-truth answers to enable precise and stable reward computation. In the visual domain, we similarly observe that a wide range of visual understanding tasks are inherently equipped with well-defined ground-truth annotations. This property makes them naturally compatible with rule-based reward mechanisms. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the extension of R1-style reinforcement learning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their visual reasoning capabilities. To this end, we develop VLM-R1, a dedicated framework designed to harness RL for improving VLMs' performance on general vision-language tasks. Using this framework, we further explore the feasibility of applying RL to visual domain. Experimental results indicate that the RL-based model not only delivers competitive performance on visual understanding tasks but also surpasses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in generalization ability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies that uncover a series of noteworthy insights, including the presence of reward hacking in object detection, the emergence of the "OD aha moment", the impact of training data quality, and the scaling behavior of RL across different model sizes. Through these analyses, we aim to deepen the understanding of how reinforcement learning enhances the capabilities of vision-language models, and we hope our findings and open-source contributions will support continued progress in the vision-language RL community.

- **[Enhancing Multi-task Learning Capability of Medical Generalist Foundation Model via Image-centric Multi-annotation Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09967)**  `arXiv:2504.09967`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Xun Zhu, Fanbin Mo, Zheng Zhang, Jiaxi Wang, Yiming Shi, Ming Wu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of medical generalist foundation models has revolutionized conventional task-specific model development paradigms, aiming to better handle multiple tasks through joint training on large-scale medical datasets. However, recent advances prioritize simple data scaling or architectural component enhancement, while neglecting to re-examine multi-task learning from a data-centric perspective. Critically, simply aggregating existing data resources leads to decentralized image-task alignment, which fails to cultivate comprehensive image understanding or align with clinical needs for multi-dimensional image interpretation. In this paper, we introduce the image-centric multi-annotation X-ray dataset (IMAX), the first attempt to enhance the multi-task learning capabilities of medical multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) from the data construction level. To be specific, IMAX is featured from the following attributes: 1) High-quality data curation. A comprehensive collection of more than 354K entries applicable to seven different medical tasks. 2) Image-centric dense annotation. Each X-ray image is associated with an average of 4.10 tasks and 7.46 training entries, ensuring multi-task representation richness per image. Compared to the general decentralized multi-annotation X-ray dataset (DMAX), IMAX consistently demonstrates significant multi-task average performance gains ranging from 3.20% to 21.05% across seven open-source state-of-the-art medical MLLMs. Moreover, we investigate differences in statistical patterns exhibited by IMAX and DMAX training processes, exploring potential correlations between optimization dynamics and multi-task performance. Finally, leveraging the core concept of IMAX data construction, we propose an optimized DMAX-based training strategy to alleviate the dilemma of obtaining high-quality IMAX data in practical scenarios.

  Long-context video understanding in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) faces a critical challenge: balancing computational efficiency with the retention of fine-grained spatio-temporal patterns. Existing approaches (e.g., sparse sampling, dense sampling with low resolution, and token compression) suffer from significant information loss in temporal dynamics, spatial details, or subtle interactions, particularly in videos with complex motion or varying resolutions. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{Mavors}$, a novel framework that introduces $\mathbf{M}$ulti-gr$\mathbf{a}$nularity $\mathbf{v}$ide$\mathbf{o}$ $\mathbf{r}$epre$\mathbf{s}$entation for holistic long-video modeling. Specifically, Mavors directly encodes raw video content into latent representations through two core components: 1) an Intra-chunk Vision Encoder (IVE) that preserves high-resolution spatial features via 3D convolutions and Vision Transformers, and 2) an Inter-chunk Feature Aggregator (IFA) that establishes temporal coherence across chunks using transformer-based dependency modeling with chunk-level rotary position encodings. Moreover, the framework unifies image and video understanding by treating images as single-frame videos via sub-image decomposition. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate Mavors' superiority in maintaining both spatial fidelity and temporal continuity, significantly outperforming existing methods in tasks requiring fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning.

- **[BabyVLM: Data-Efficient Pretraining of VLMs Inspired by Infant Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09426)**  `arXiv:2504.09426`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Shengao Wang, Arjun Chandra, Aoming Liu, Venkatesh Saligrama, Boqing Gong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human infants rapidly develop visual reasoning skills from minimal input, suggesting that developmentally inspired pretraining could significantly enhance the efficiency of vision-language models (VLMs). Although recent efforts have leveraged infant-inspired datasets like SAYCam, existing evaluation benchmarks remain misaligned--they are either too simplistic, narrowly scoped, or tailored for large-scale pretrained models. Additionally, training exclusively on infant data overlooks the broader, diverse input from which infants naturally learn. To address these limitations, we propose BabyVLM, a novel framework comprising comprehensive in-domain evaluation benchmarks and a synthetic training dataset created via child-directed transformations of existing datasets. We demonstrate that VLMs trained with our synthetic dataset achieve superior performance on BabyVLM tasks compared to models trained solely on SAYCam or general-purpose data of the SAYCam size. BabyVLM thus provides a robust, developmentally aligned evaluation tool and illustrates how compact models trained on carefully curated data can generalize effectively, opening pathways toward data-efficient vision-language learning paradigms.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a range of multimodal tasks; however, their practical deployment is often constrained by high computational costs and prolonged inference times. Since the vision modality typically carries more information than the text modality, compressing visual prompts offers a promising solution to alleviate these challenges. Existing approaches predominantly focus on refining model architectures or directly reducing the number of visual tokens. However, these methods often compromise inference performance due to a lack of consideration for the unique spatial and temporal characteristics of visual data. In this work, we propose a token compression paradigm that operates on both spatial and temporal dimensions. Our approach includes a learning-free, plug-and-play compression pipeline that can be seamlessly integrated into most Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) frameworks. By leveraging this method, we enhance the model inference capability while simultaneously reducing its computational cost. Experimental results on the Video-QA task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing significant improvements in efficiency without sacrificing performance.

  _Rui Chen, Lei Sun, Jing Tang, Geng Li, Xiangxiang Chu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in video generation have posed great challenges in the assessment of AI-generated content, particularly with the emergence of increasingly sophisticated models. The various inconsistencies and defects observed in such videos are inherently complex, making overall scoring notoriously difficult. In this paper, we emphasize the critical importance of integrating fine-grained reasoning into video evaluation, and we propose $\textbf{F}$ing$\textbf{ER}$, a novel entity-level reasoning evaluation framework that first automatically generates $\textbf{F}$ine-grained $\textbf{E}$ntity-level questions, and then answers those questions by a $\textbf{R}$easoning model with scores, which can be subsequently weighted summed to an overall score for different applications. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to derive entity-level questions across five distinct perspectives, which (i) often focus on some specific entities of the content, thereby making answering or scoring much easier by MLLMs, and (ii) are more interpretable. Then we construct a FingER dataset, consisting of approximately 3.3k videos and corresponding 60k fine-grained QA annotations, each with detailed reasons. Based on that, we further investigate various training protocols to best incentivize the reasoning capability of MLLMs for correct answer prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a reasoning model trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a cold-start strategy achieves the best performance. Notably, our model surpasses existing methods by a relative margin of $11.8\%$ on GenAI-Bench and $5.5\%$ on MonetBench with only 3.3k training videos, which is at most one-tenth of the training samples utilized by other methods. Our code and dataset will be released soon.

- **[COUNTS: Benchmarking Object Detectors and Multimodal Large Language Models under Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10158)**  `arXiv:2504.10158`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current object detectors often suffer significant perfor-mance degradation in real-world applications when encountering distributional shifts. Consequently, the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capability of object detectors has garnered increasing attention from researchers. Despite this growing interest, there remains a lack of a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and evaluation benchmark with fine-grained annotations tailored to assess the OOD generalization on more intricate tasks like object detection and grounding. To address this gap, we introduce COUNTS, a large-scale OOD dataset with object-level annotations. COUNTS encompasses 14 natural distributional shifts, over 222K samples, and more than 1,196K labeled bounding boxes. Leveraging COUNTS, we introduce two novel benchmarks: O(OD)2 and OODG. O(OD)2 is designed to comprehensively evaluate the OOD generalization capabilities of object detectors by utilizing controlled distribution shifts between training and testing data. OODG, on the other hand, aims to assess the OOD generalization of grounding abilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our findings reveal that, while large models and extensive pre-training data substantially en hance performance in in-distribution (IID) scenarios, significant limitations and opportunities for improvement persist in OOD contexts for both object detectors and MLLMs. In visual grounding tasks, even the advanced GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 only achieve 56.7% and 28.0% accuracy, respectively. We hope COUNTS facilitates advancements in the development and assessment of robust object detectors and MLLMs capable of maintaining high performance under distributional shifts.

  Vision-Language Model (VLM) have gained widespread adoption in Open-Vocabulary (OV) object detection and segmentation tasks. Despite they have shown promise on OV-related tasks, their effectiveness in conventional vision tasks has thus far been unevaluated. In this work, we present the systematic review of VLM-based detection and segmentation, view VLM as the foundational model and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple downstream tasks for the first time: 1) The evaluation spans eight detection scenarios (closed-set detection, domain adaptation, crowded objects, etc.) and eight segmentation scenarios (few-shot, open-world, small object, etc.), revealing distinct performance advantages and limitations of various VLM architectures across tasks. 2) As for detection tasks, we evaluate VLMs under three finetuning granularities: \textit{zero prediction}, \textit{visual fine-tuning}, and \textit{text prompt}, and further analyze how different finetuning strategies impact performance under varied task. 3) Based on empirical findings, we provide in-depth analysis of the correlations between task characteristics, model architectures, and training methodologies, offering insights for future VLM design. 4) We believe that this work shall be valuable to the pattern recognition experts working in the fields of computer vision, multimodal learning, and vision foundation models by introducing them to the problem, and familiarizing them with the current status of the progress while providing promising directions for future research.

  Tracking multiple objects based on textual queries is a challenging task that requires linking language understanding with object association across frames. Previous works typically train the whole process end-to-end or integrate an additional referring text module into a multi-object tracker, but they both require supervised training and potentially struggle with generalization to open-set queries. In this work, we introduce ReferGPT, a novel zero-shot referring multi-object tracking framework. We provide a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with spatial knowledge enabling it to generate 3D-aware captions. This enhances its descriptive capabilities and supports a more flexible referring vocabulary without training. We also propose a robust query-matching strategy, leveraging CLIP-based semantic encoding and fuzzy matching to associate MLLM generated captions with user queries. Extensive experiments on Refer-KITTI, Refer-KITTIv2 and Refer-KITTI+ demonstrate that ReferGPT achieves competitive performance against trained methods, showcasing its robustness and zero-shot capabilities in autonomous driving.

  Understanding and addressing corner cases is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Vision-language models (VLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing scenario comprehension, yet they face significant challenges, such as hallucination and insufficient real-world grounding, which compromise their performance in critical driving scenarios. In this work, RAC3, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of VLMs in corner case comprehension, is proposed. RAC3 integrates a frequency-spatial fusion (FSF) image encoder, cross-modal alignment fine-tuning with hard and semi-hard negative mining, and a fast querying pipeline based on KMeans clustering and hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) indexing. A multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy to guide analogical reasoning and reduce hallucinations during inference is introduced. Moreover, an update mechanism is integrated into RAC3 to ensure continual learning within the framework. Extensive experiments on the CODA and NuScenes datasets demonstrate that RAC3 significantly improves corner case comprehension across multiple downstream tasks. Compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, RAC3 achieves the highest final score of 74.46 on the CODA-LM benchmark and shows consistent performance gains when integrated with end-to-end frameworks like DriveLM. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented strategies and cross-modal alignment for safer and more interpretable autonomous driving.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hallucinate, resulting in an emerging topic of visual hallucination evaluation (VHE). This paper contributes a ChatGPT-Prompted visual hallucination evaluation Dataset (PhD) for objective VHE at a large scale. The essence of VHE is to ask an MLLM questions about specific images to assess its susceptibility to hallucination. Depending on what to ask (objects, attributes, sentiment, etc.) and how the questions are asked, we structure PhD along two dimensions, i.e. task and mode. Five visual recognition tasks, ranging from low-level (object / attribute recognition) to middle-level (sentiment / position recognition and counting), are considered. Besides a normal visual QA mode, which we term PhD-base, PhD also asks questions with specious context (PhD-sec) or with incorrect context ({PhD-icc), or with AI-generated counter common sense images (PhD-ccs). We construct PhD by a ChatGPT-assisted semi-automated pipeline, encompassing four pivotal modules: task-specific hallucinatory item (hitem) selection, hitem-embedded question generation, specious / incorrect context generation, and counter-common-sense (CCS) image generation. With over 14k daily images, 750 CCS images and 102k VQA triplets in total, PhD reveals considerable variability in MLLMs' performance across various modes and tasks, offering valuable insights into the nature of hallucination. As such, PhD stands as a potent tool not only for VHE but may also play a significant role in the refinement of MLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce InternVL3, a significant advancement in the InternVL series featuring a native multimodal pre-training paradigm. Rather than adapting a text-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and linguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora during a single pre-training stage. This unified training paradigm effectively addresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in conventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve performance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position encoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed preference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies alongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of multi-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the MMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its capabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models, including ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also maintaining strong pure-language proficiency. In pursuit of open-science principles, we will publicly release both the training data and model weights to foster further research and development in next-generation MLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large-scale pre-trained image-to-3D generative models have exhibited remarkable capabilities in diverse shape generations. However, most of them struggle to synthesize plausible 3D assets when the reference image is flat-colored like hand drawings due to the lack of 3D illusion, which are often the most user-friendly input modalities in art content creation. To this end, we propose Art3D, a training-free method that can lift flat-colored 2D designs into 3D. By leveraging structural and semantic features with pre- trained 2D image generation models and a VLM-based realism evaluation, Art3D successfully enhances the three-dimensional illusion in reference images, thus simplifying the process of generating 3D from 2D, and proves adaptable to a wide range of painting styles. To benchmark the generalization performance of existing image-to-3D models on flat-colored images without 3D feeling, we collect a new dataset, Flat-2D, with over 100 samples. Experimental results demonstrate the performance and robustness of Art3D, exhibiting superior generalizable capacity and promising practical applicability.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve remarkable performance for fine-grained pixel-level understanding tasks. However, all the works rely heavily on extra components, such as vision encoder (CLIP), segmentation experts, leading to high system complexity and limiting model scaling. In this work, our goal is to explore a highly simplified MLLM without introducing extra components. Our work is motivated by the recent works on Single trAnsformer as a unified vIsion-Language Model (SAIL) design, where these works jointly learn vision tokens and text tokens in transformers. We present Pixel-SAIL, a single transformer for pixel-wise MLLM tasks. In particular, we present three technical improvements on the plain baseline. First, we design a learnable upsampling module to refine visual token features. Secondly, we propose a novel visual prompt injection strategy to enable the single transformer to understand visual prompt inputs and benefit from the early fusion of visual prompt embeddings and vision tokens. Thirdly, we introduce a vision expert distillation strategy to efficiently enhance the single transformer's fine-grained feature extraction capability. In addition, we have collected a comprehensive pixel understanding benchmark (PerBench), using a manual check. It includes three tasks: detailed object description, visual prompt-based question answering, and visual-text referring segmentation. Extensive experiments on four referring segmentation benchmarks, one visual prompt benchmark, and our PerBench show that our Pixel-SAIL achieves comparable or even better results with a much simpler pipeline. Code and model will be released atthis https URL.

  This paper introduces SAIL, a single transformer unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) that integrates raw pixel encoding and language decoding within a singular architecture. Unlike existing modular MLLMs, which rely on a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT), SAIL eliminates the need for a separate vision encoder, presenting a more minimalist architecture design. Instead of introducing novel architectural components, SAIL adapts mix-attention mechanisms and multimodal positional encodings to better align with the distinct characteristics of visual and textual modalities. We systematically compare SAIL's properties-including scalability, cross-modal information flow patterns, and visual representation capabilities-with those of modular MLLMs. By scaling both training data and model size, SAIL achieves performance comparable to modular MLLMs. Notably, the removal of pretrained ViT components enhances SAIL's scalability and results in significantly different cross-modal information flow patterns. Moreover, SAIL demonstrates strong visual representation capabilities, achieving results on par with ViT-22B in vision tasks such as semantic segmentation.

  _Zongcan Ding, Haodong Zhang, Peng Wu, Guansong Pang, Zhiwei Yang, Peng Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify unexpected events in videos and has wide applications in safety-critical domains. While semi-supervised methods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer from high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection. However, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder real-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways in human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that integrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these limitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly confidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than the entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM for elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to domain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal patterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs. During inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts for anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast and slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively combines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable detection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications with high reliability requirements.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-world 3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to generate a voxelized 3D representation from sensor inputs while recognizing both known and unknown objects. Transferring open-vocabulary knowledge from vision-language models (VLMs) offers a promising direction but remains challenging. However, methods based on VLM-derived 2D pseudo-labels with traditional supervision are limited by a predefined label space and lack general prediction capabilities. Direct alignment with pretrained image embeddings, on the other hand, fails to achieve reliable performance due to often inconsistent image and text representations in VLMs. To address these challenges, we propose AGO, a novel 3D occupancy prediction framework with adaptive grounding to handle diverse open-world scenarios. AGO first encodes surrounding images and class prompts into 3D and text embeddings, respectively, leveraging similarity-based grounding training with 3D pseudo-labels. Additionally, a modality adapter maps 3D embeddings into a space aligned with VLM-derived image embeddings, reducing modality gaps. Experiments on Occ3D-nuScenes show that AGO improves unknown object prediction in zero-shot and few-shot transfer while achieving state-of-the-art closed-world self-supervised performance, surpassing prior methods by 4.09 mIoU.

  We propose an efficient evaluation protocol for large vision-language models (VLMs). Given their broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities, multiple benchmarks are needed for comprehensive assessment, making evaluation computationally expensive. To improve efficiency, we construct a subset that yields results comparable to full benchmark evaluations. Our benchmark classification experiments reveal that no single benchmark fully covers all challenges. We then introduce a subset construction method using farthest point sampling (FPS). Our experiments show that FPS-based benchmarks maintain a strong correlation (> 0.96) with full evaluations while using only ~1\% of the data. Additionally, applying FPS to an existing benchmark improves correlation with overall evaluation results, suggesting its potential to reduce unintended dataset biases.

  We introduce FUSION, a family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with a fully vision-language alignment and integration paradigm. Unlike existing methods that primarily rely on late-stage modality interaction during LLM decoding, our approach achieves deep, dynamic integration throughout the entire processing pipeline. To this end, we propose Text-Guided Unified Vision Encoding, incorporating textual information in vision encoding to achieve pixel-level integration. We further design Context-Aware Recursive Alignment Decoding that recursively aggregates visual features conditioned on textual context during decoding, enabling fine-grained, question-level semantic integration. To guide feature mapping and mitigate modality discrepancies, we develop Dual-Supervised Semantic Mapping Loss. Additionally, we construct a Synthesized Language-Driven Question-Answer (QA) dataset through a new data synthesis method, prioritizing high-quality QA pairs to optimize text-guided feature integration. Building on these foundations, we train FUSION at two scales-3B, 8B-and demonstrate that our full-modality integration approach significantly outperforms existing methods with only 630 vision tokens. Notably, FUSION 3B surpasses Cambrian-1 8B and Florence-VL 8B on most benchmarks. FUSION 3B continues to outperform Cambrian-1 8B even when limited to 300 vision tokens. Our ablation studies show that FUSION outperforms LLaVA-NeXT on over half of the benchmarks under same configuration without dynamic resolution, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable versatility in understanding diverse multimodal data and tasks. However, these capabilities come with an increased model scale. While post-training pruning reduces model size in unimodal models, its application to MLLMs often yields limited success. Our analysis discovers that conventional methods fail to account for the unique token attributes across layers and modalities inherent to MLLMs. Inspired by this observation, we propose TAMP, a simple yet effective pruning framework tailored for MLLMs, featuring two key components: (1) Diversity-Aware Sparsity, which adjusts sparsity ratio per layer based on diversities among multimodal output tokens, preserving more parameters in high-diversity layers; and (2) Adaptive Multimodal Input Activation, which identifies representative multimodal input tokens using attention scores to guide unstructured weight pruning. We validate our method on two state-of-the-art MLLMs: LLaVA-NeXT, designed for vision-language tasks, and VideoLLaMA2, capable of processing audio, visual, and language modalities. Empirical experiments across various multimodal evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that each component of our approach substantially outperforms existing pruning techniques.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable versatility but face challenges in demonstrating true visual understanding, particularly in chart reasoning tasks. Existing benchmarks like ChartQA reveal significant reliance on text-based shortcuts and probabilistic pattern-matching rather than genuine visual reasoning. To rigorously evaluate visual reasoning, we introduce a more challenging test scenario by removing textual labels and introducing chart perturbations in the ChartQA dataset. Under these conditions, models like GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0 Pro experience up to a 30% performance drop, underscoring their limitations. To address these challenges, we propose Socratic Chart, a new framework that transforms chart images into Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) representations, enabling MLLMs to integrate textual and visual modalities for enhanced chart understanding. Socratic Chart employs a multi-agent pipeline with specialized agent-generators to extract primitive chart attributes (e.g., bar heights, line coordinates) and an agent-critic to validate results, ensuring high-fidelity symbolic representations. Our framework surpasses state-of-the-art models in accurately capturing chart primitives and improving reasoning performance, establishing a robust pathway for advancing MLLM visual understanding.

  Medical image captioning via vision-language models has shown promising potential for clinical diagnosis assistance. However, generating contextually relevant descriptions with accurate modality recognition remains challenging. We present DualPrompt-MedCap, a novel dual-prompt enhancement framework that augments Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) through two specialized components: (1) a modality-aware prompt derived from a semi-supervised classification model pretrained on medical question-answer pairs, and (2) a question-guided prompt leveraging biomedical language model embeddings. To address the lack of captioning ground truth, we also propose an evaluation framework that jointly considers spatial-semantic relevance and medical narrative quality. Experiments on multiple medical datasets demonstrate that DualPrompt-MedCap outperforms the baseline BLIP-3 by achieving a 22% improvement in modality recognition accuracy while generating more comprehensive and question-aligned descriptions. Our method enables the generation of clinically accurate reports that can serve as medical experts' prior knowledge and automatic annotations for downstream vision-language tasks.

  Advertisement videos serve as a rich and valuable source of purpose-driven information, encompassing high-quality visual, textual, and contextual cues designed to engage viewers. They are often more complex than general videos of similar duration due to their structured narratives and rapid scene transitions, posing significant challenges to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we introduce VideoAds, the first dataset tailored for benchmarking the performance of MLLMs on advertisement videos. VideoAds comprises well-curated advertisement videos with complex temporal structures, accompanied by \textbf{manually} annotated diverse questions across three core tasks: visual finding, video summary, and visual reasoning. We propose a quantitative measure to compare VideoAds against existing benchmarks in terms of video complexity. Through extensive experiments, we find that Qwen2.5-VL-72B, an opensource MLLM, achieves 73.35\% accuracy on VideoAds, outperforming GPT-4o (66.82\%) and Gemini-1.5 Pro (69.66\%); the two proprietary models especially fall behind the opensource model in video summarization and reasoning, but perform the best in visual finding. Notably, human experts easily achieve a remarkable accuracy of 94.27\%. These results underscore the necessity of advancing MLLMs' temporal modeling capabilities and highlight VideoAds as a potentially pivotal benchmark for future research in understanding video that requires high FPS sampling.

  Safety hazard identification and prevention are the key elements of proactive safety management. Previous research has extensively explored the applications of computer vision to automatically identify hazards from image clips collected from construction sites. However, these methods struggle to identify context-specific hazards, as they focus on detecting predefined individual entities without understanding their spatial relationships and interactions. Furthermore, their limited adaptability to varying construction site guidelines and conditions hinders their generalization across different projects. These limitations reduce their ability to assess hazards in complex construction environments and adaptability to unseen risks, leading to potential safety gaps. To address these challenges, we proposed and experimentally validated a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based framework for the identification of construction hazards. The framework incorporates a prompt engineering module that structures safety guidelines into contextual queries, allowing VLM to process visual information and generate hazard assessments aligned with the regulation guide. Within this framework, we evaluated state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini, Llama 3.2, and InternVL2, using a custom dataset of 1100 construction site images. Experimental results show that GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro outperformed alternatives and displayed promising BERTScore of 0.906 and 0.888 respectively, highlighting their ability to identify both general and context-specific hazards. However, processing times remain a significant challenge, impacting real-time feasibility. These findings offer insights into the practical deployment of VLMs for construction site hazard detection, thereby contributing to the enhancement of proactive safety management.

  Recent advancements in reinforcement learning have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.

  Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved performance on computer vision tasks. Previous image classification methods primarily modify model architectures or add features, and they optimize models using cross-entropy loss on class logits. Since they focus on classifying images with considering class labels, these methods may struggle to learn various \emph{aspects} of classes (e.g., natural positions and shape changes). Rethinking the previous approach from a novel view, we propose a multi-aspect knowledge distillation method using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our approach involves: 1) querying Large Language Model with multi-aspect questions relevant to the knowledge we want to transfer to the model, 2) extracting corresponding logits from MLLM, and 3) expanding the model's output dimensions to distill these multi-aspect logits. We then apply cross-entropy loss to class logits and binary cross-entropy loss to multi-aspect logits. Through our method, the model can learn not only the knowledge about visual aspects but also the abstract and complex aspects that require a deeper understanding. We primarily apply our method to image classification, and to explore the potential for extending our model, such as object detection. In all experimental results, our method improves the performance of the baselines. Additionally, we analyze the effect of multi-aspect knowledge distillation. These results demonstrate that our method can transfer knowledge about various aspects to the model and the aspect knowledge can enhance model performance in computer vision tasks.

  Vision Language Models (VLMs) can be trained more efficiently if training sets can be reduced in size. Recent work has shown the benefits of masking text during VLM training using a variety of approaches: truncation, random masking, block masking and syntax masking. In this paper, we show that the best masking strategy changes over training epochs and that, given sufficient training epochs. We analyze existing text masking approaches including syntax masking, which is currently the state of the art, and identify the word frequency distribution as important in determining their success. Experiments on a large range of data sets demonstrate that syntax masking is outperformed by other approaches, given sufficient epochs, and that our proposed frequency-based approach, called Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training with Word Frequency Masking (CLIPF) has numerous advantages. The benefits are particularly evident as the number of input tokens decreases.

Although the initial results are promising, the dense prediction capabilities of VLMs still require further improvement. In this study, we enhance the semantic segmentation performance of CLIP by introducing new modules and modifications: 1) architectural changes in the last layer of ViT and the incorporation of attention maps from the middle layers with the last layer, 2) Image Engineering: applying data augmentations to enrich input image representations, and 3) using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate definitions and synonyms for each class name to leverage CLIP's open-vocabulary capabilities. Our training-free method, ITACLIP, outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on segmentation benchmarks such as COCO-Stuff, COCO-Object, Pascal Context, and Pascal VOC.

  Vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) in the medical field utilizes contrastive learning on image-text pairs to achieve effective transfer across tasks. Yet, current VLP approaches with the masked modeling strategy face two challenges when applied to the medical domain. First, current models struggle to accurately reconstruct key pathological features due to the scarcity of medical data. Second, most methods only adopt either paired image-text or image-only data, failing to exploit the combination of both paired and unpaired data. To this end, this paper proposes the MMCLIP (Masked Medical Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) framework to enhance pathological learning and feature learning via unpaired data. First, we introduce the attention-masked image modeling (AttMIM) and entity-driven masked language modeling module (EntMLM), which learns to reconstruct pathological visual and textual tokens via multi-modal feature interaction, thus improving medical-enhanced features. The AttMIM module masks a portion of the image features that are highly responsive to textual features. This allows MMCLIP to improve the reconstruction of highly similar image data in medicine efficiency. Second, our MMCLIP capitalizes unpaired data to enhance multimodal learning by introducing disease-kind prompts. The experimental results show that MMCLIP achieves SOTA for zero-shot and fine-tuning classification performance on five datasets. Our code will be available atthis https URL.

  Textual adversarial examples pose serious threats to the reliability of natural language processing systems. Recent studies suggest that adversarial examples tend to deviate from the underlying manifold of normal texts, whereas pre-trained masked language models can approximate the manifold of normal data. These findings inspire the exploration of masked language models for detecting textual adversarial attacks. We first introduce Masked Language Model-based Detection (MLMD), leveraging the mask and unmask operations of the masked language modeling (MLM) objective to induce the difference in manifold changes between normal and adversarial texts. Although MLMD achieves competitive detection performance, its exhaustive one-by-one masking strategy introduces significant computational overhead. Our posterior analysis reveals that a significant number of non-keywords in the input are not important for detection but consume resources. Building on this, we introduce Gradient-guided MLMD (GradMLMD), which leverages gradient information to identify and skip non-keywords during detection, significantly reducing resource consumption without compromising detection performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose the Metropolis-Hastings Captioning Game (MHCG), a method to fuse knowledge of multiple vision-language models (VLMs) by learning from each other. Although existing methods that combine multiple models suffer from inference costs and architectural constraints, MHCG avoids these problems by performing decentralized Bayesian inference through a process resembling a language game. The knowledge fusion process establishes communication between two VLM agents alternately captioning images and learning from each other. We conduct two image-captioning experiments with two VLMs, each pre-trained on a different dataset. The first experiment demonstrates that MHCG achieves consistent improvement in reference-free evaluation metrics. The second experiment investigates how MHCG contributes to sharing VLMs' category-level vocabulary by observing the occurrence of the vocabulary in the generated captions.

  Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to reduce hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). These methods work by constructing contrastive samples to induce hallucinations and then suppressing them in the output distribution. However, this paper demonstrates that such approaches fail to effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. The performance improvements observed on POPE Benchmark are largely driven by two misleading factors: (1) crude, unidirectional adjustments to the model's output distribution and (2) the adaptive plausibility constraint, which reduces the sampling strategy to greedy search. To further illustrate these issues, we introduce a series of spurious improvement methods and evaluate their performance against contrastive decoding techniques. Experimental results reveal that the observed performance gains in contrastive decoding are entirely unrelated to its intended goal of mitigating hallucinations. Our findings challenge common assumptions about the effectiveness of contrastive decoding strategies and pave the way for developing genuinely effective solutions to hallucinations in MLLMs.

  Pretrained masked language models (MLMs) have demonstrated an impressive capability to comprehend and encode conceptual knowledge, revealing a lattice structure among concepts. This raises a critical question: how does this conceptualization emerge from MLM pretraining? In this paper, we explore this problem from the perspective of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), a mathematical framework that derives concept lattices from the observations of object-attribute relationships. We show that the MLM's objective implicitly learns a \emph{formal context} that describes objects, attributes, and their dependencies, which enables the reconstruction of a concept lattice through FCA. We propose a novel framework for concept lattice construction from pretrained MLMs and investigate the origin of the inductive biases of MLMs in lattice structure learning. Our framework differs from previous work because it does not rely on human-defined concepts and allows for discovering "latent" concepts that extend beyond human definitions. We create three datasets for evaluation, and the empirical results verify our hypothesis.

  Transformer-based language models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). However, using these models often involves navigating multiple frameworks and tools, as well as writing repetitive boilerplate code. This complexity can discourage non-programmers and beginners, and even slow down prototyping for experienced developers. To address these challenges, we introduce Langformers, an open-source Python library designed to streamline NLP pipelines through a unified, factory-based interface for large language model (LLM) and masked language model (MLM) tasks. Langformers integrates conversational AI, MLM pretraining, text classification, sentence embedding/reranking, data labelling, semantic search, and knowledge distillation into a cohesive API, supporting popular platforms such as Hugging Face and Ollama. Key innovations include: (1) task-specific factories that abstract training, inference, and deployment complexities; (2) built-in memory and streaming for conversational agents; and (3) lightweight, modular design that prioritizes ease of use.

  Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models have showcased remarkable capabilities. However, they often falter when confronted with complex reasoning tasks that humans typically address through visual aids and deliberate, step-by-step thinking. While existing methods have explored text-based slow thinking or rudimentary visual assistance, they fall short of capturing the intricate, interleaved nature of human visual-verbal reasoning processes. To overcome these limitations and inspired by the mechanisms of slow thinking in human cognition, we introduce VisuoThink, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates visuospatial and linguistic domains. VisuoThink facilitates multimodal slow thinking by enabling progressive visual-textual reasoning and incorporates test-time scaling through look-ahead tree search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VisuoThink significantly enhances reasoning capabilities via inference-time scaling, even without fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks involving geometry and spatial reasoning.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance by effectively integrating visual and textual information to solve complex tasks. However, it is not clear how these models reason over the visual and textual data together, nor how the flow of information between modalities is structured. In this paper, we examine how VLMs reason by analyzing their biases when confronted with scenarios that present conflicting image and text cues, a common occurrence in real-world applications. To uncover the extent and nature of these biases, we build upon existing benchmarks to create five datasets containing mismatched image-text pairs, covering topics in mathematics, science, and visual descriptions. Our analysis shows that VLMs favor text in simpler queries but shift toward images as query complexity increases. This bias correlates with model scale, with the difference between the percentage of image- and text-preferred responses ranging from +56.8% (image favored) to -74.4% (text favored), depending on the task and model. In addition, we explore three mitigation strategies: simple prompt modifications, modifications that explicitly instruct models on how to handle conflicting information (akin to chain-of-thought prompting), and a task decomposition strategy that analyzes each modality separately before combining their results. Our findings indicate that the effectiveness of these strategies in identifying and mitigating bias varies significantly and is closely linked to the model's overall performance on the task and the specific modality in question.

  Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents offer cross-platform solutions for automating complex digital tasks, with significant potential to transform productivity workflows. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity of high-quality trajectory data. To address this limitation, we propose training Vision Language Models (VLMs) on data-rich, reasoning-intensive tasks during a dedicated mid-training stage, and then examine how incorporating these tasks facilitates generalization to GUI planning scenarios. Specifically, we explore a range of tasks with readily available instruction-tuning data, including GUI perception, multimodal reasoning, and textual reasoning. Through extensive experiments across 11 mid-training tasks, we demonstrate that: (1) Task generalization proves highly effective, yielding substantial improvements across most settings. For instance, multimodal mathematical reasoning enhances performance on AndroidWorld by an absolute 6.3%. Remarkably, text-only mathematical data significantly boosts GUI web agent performance, achieving a 5.6% improvement on WebArena and 5.4% improvement on AndroidWorld, underscoring notable cross-modal generalization from text-based to visual domains; (2) Contrary to prior assumptions, GUI perception data - previously considered closely aligned with GUI agent tasks and widely utilized for training - has a comparatively limited impact on final performance; (3) Building on these insights, we identify the most effective mid-training tasks and curate optimized mixture datasets, resulting in absolute performance gains of 8.0% on WebArena and 12.2% on AndroidWorld. Our work provides valuable insights into cross-domain knowledge transfer for GUI agents and offers a practical approach to addressing data scarcity challenges in this emerging field.

  Scientific diagrams are vital tools for communicating structured knowledge across disciplines. However, they are often published as static raster images, losing symbolic semantics and limiting reuse. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a pathway to bridging vision and structure, existing methods lack semantic control and structural interpretability, especially on complex diagrams. We propose Draw with Thought (DwT), a training-free framework that guides MLLMs to reconstruct diagrams into editable mxGraph XML code through cognitively-grounded Chain-of-Thought reasoning. DwT enables interpretable and controllable outputs without model fine-tuning by dividing the task into two stages: Coarse-to-Fine Planning, which handles perceptual structuring and semantic specification, and Structure-Aware Code Generation, enhanced by format-guided refinement. To support evaluation, we release Plot2XML, a benchmark of 247 real-world scientific diagrams with gold-standard XML annotations. Extensive experiments across eight MLLMs show that our approach yields high-fidelity, semantically aligned, and structurally valid reconstructions, with human evaluations confirming strong alignment in both accuracy and visual aesthetics, offering a scalable solution for converting static visuals into executable representations and advancing machine understanding of scientific graphics.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs have been remarkable. However, these models still rely solely on their parametric knowledge, which limits their ability to generate up-to-date information and increases the risk of producing erroneous content. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially mitigates these challenges by incorporating external data sources, yet the reliance on databases and retrieval systems can introduce irrelevant or inaccurate documents, ultimately undermining both performance and reasoning quality. In this paper, we propose Multi-Modal Knowledge-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMKB-RAG), a novel multi-modal RAG framework that leverages the inherent knowledge boundaries of models to dynamically generate semantic tags for the retrieval process. This strategy enables the joint filtering of retrieved documents, retaining only the most relevant and accurate references. Extensive experiments on knowledge-based visual question-answering tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach: on the E-VQA dataset, our method improves performance by +4.2\% on the Single-Hop subset and +0.4\% on the full dataset, while on the InfoSeek dataset, it achieves gains of +7.8\% on the Unseen-Q subset, +8.2\% on the Unseen-E subset, and +8.1\% on the full dataset. These results highlight significant enhancements in both accuracy and robustness over the current state-of-the-art MLLM and RAG frameworks.

  Knowing others' intentions and taking others' perspectives are two core components of human intelligence that are considered to be instantiations of theory-of-mind. Infiltrating machines with these abilities is an important step towards building human-level artificial intelligence. Here, to investigate intentionality understanding and level-2 perspective-taking in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we constructed the IntentBench and PerspectBench, which together contains over 300 cognitive experiments grounded in real-world scenarios and classic cognitive tasks. We found VLMs achieving high performance on intentionality understanding but low performance on level-2 perspective-taking. This suggests a potential dissociation between simulation-based and theory-based theory-of-mind abilities in VLMs, highlighting the concern that they are not capable of using model-based reasoning to infer others' mental states.
