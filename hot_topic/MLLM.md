- **[HomeEmergency -- Using Audio to Find and Respond to Emergencies in the Home](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01089)**  `arXiv:2504.01089`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _James F. Mullen Jr, Dhruva Kumar, Xuewei Qi, Rajasimman Madhivanan, Arnie Sen, Dinesh Manocha, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the United States alone accidental home deaths exceed 128,000 per year. Our work aims to enable home robots who respond to emergency scenarios in the home, preventing injuries and deaths. We introduce a new dataset of household emergencies based in the ThreeDWorld simulator. Each scenario in our dataset begins with an instantaneous or periodic sound which may or may not be an emergency. The agent must navigate the multi-room home scene using prior observations, alongside audio signals and images from the simulator, to determine if there is an emergency or not.In addition to our new dataset, we present a modular approach for localizing and identifying potential home emergencies. Underpinning our approach is a novel probabilistic dynamic scene graph (P-DSG), where our key insight is that graph nodes corresponding to agents can be represented with a probabilistic edge. This edge, when refined using Bayesian inference, enables efficient and effective localization of agents in the scene. We also utilize multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs) as a component in our approach, determining object traits (e.g. flammability) and identifying emergencies. We present a demonstration of our method completing a real-world version of our task on a consumer robot, showing the transferability of both our task and our method. Our dataset will be released to the public upon this papers publication.

- **[BIOMEDICA: An Open Biomedical Image-Caption Archive, Dataset, and Vision-Language Models Derived from Scientific Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07171)**  `arXiv:2501.07171`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The development of vision-language models (VLMs) is driven by large-scale and diverse multimodal datasets. However, progress toward generalist biomedical VLMs is limited by the lack of annotated, publicly accessible datasets across biology and medicine. Existing efforts are restricted to narrow domains, missing the full diversity of biomedical knowledge encoded in scientific literature. To address this gap, we introduce BIOMEDICA, a scalable, open-source framework to extract, annotate, and serialize the entirety of the PubMed Central Open Access subset into an easy-to-use, publicly accessible dataset. Our framework produces a comprehensive archive with over 24 million unique image-text pairs from over 6 million articles. Metadata and expert-guided annotations are also provided. We demonstrate the utility and accessibility of our resource by releasing BMCA-CLIP, a suite of CLIP-style models continuously pre-trained on the BIOMEDICA dataset via streaming, eliminating the need to download 27 TB of data locally. On average, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across 40 tasks - spanning pathology, radiology, ophthalmology, dermatology, surgery, molecular biology, parasitology, and cell biology - excelling in zero-shot classification with a 6.56% average improvement (as high as 29.8% and 17.5% in dermatology and ophthalmology, respectively), and stronger image-text retrieval, all while using 10x less compute. To foster reproducibility and collaboration, we release our codebase and dataset for the broader research community.

- **[On Data Synthesis and Post-training for Visual Abstract Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01324)**  `arXiv:2504.01324`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Ke Zhu, Yu Wang, Jiangjiang Liu, Qunyi Xie, Shanshan Liu, Gang Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper is a pioneering work attempting to address abstract visual reasoning (AVR) problems for large vision-language models (VLMs). We make a common LLaVA-NeXT 7B model capable of perceiving and reasoning about specific AVR problems, surpassing both open-sourced (e.g., Qwen-2-VL-72B) and closed-sourced powerful VLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) with significant margin. This is a great breakthrough since almost all previous VLMs fail or show nearly random performance on representative AVR benchmarks. Our key success is our innovative data synthesis and post-training process, aiming to fully relieve the task difficulty and elicit the model to learn, step by step. Our 7B model is also shown to be behave well on AVR without sacrificing common multimodal comprehension abilities. We hope our paper could serve as an early effort in this area and would inspire further research in abstract visual reasoning.

- **[Olympus: A Universal Task Router for Computer Vision Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09612)**  `arXiv:2412.09612`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Yuanze Lin, Yunsheng Li, Dongdong Chen, Weijian Xu, Ronald Clark, Philip H. S. Torr_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Olympus, a new approach that transforms Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into a unified framework capable of handling a wide array of computer vision tasks. Utilizing a controller MLLM, Olympus delegates over 20 specialized tasks across images, videos, and 3D objects to dedicated modules. This instruction-based routing enables complex workflows through chained actions without the need for training heavy generative models. Olympus easily integrates with existing MLLMs, expanding their capabilities with comparable performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Olympus achieves an average routing accuracy of 94.75% across 20 tasks and precision of 91.82% in chained action scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness as a universal task router that can solve a diverse range of computer vision tasks.

- **[AdPO: Enhancing the Adversarial Robustness of Large Vision-Language Models with Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01735)**  `arXiv:2504.01735`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Chaohu Liu, Tianyi Gui, Yu Liu, Linli Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4o and LLaVA, have recently witnessed remarkable advancements and are increasingly being deployed in real-world applications. However, inheriting the sensitivity of visual neural networks, LVLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can result in erroneous or malicious outputs. While existing efforts utilize adversarial fine-tuning to enhance robustness, they often suffer from performance degradation on clean inputs. In this paper, we proposes AdPO, a novel adversarial defense strategy for LVLMs based on preference optimization. For the first time, we reframe adversarial training as a preference optimization problem, aiming to enhance the model's preference for generating normal outputs on clean inputs while rejecting the potential misleading outputs for adversarial examples. Notably, AdPO achieves this by solely modifying the image encoder, e.g., CLIP ViT, resulting in superior clean and adversarial performance in a variety of downsream tasks. Considering that training involves large language models (LLMs), the computational cost increases significantly. We validate that training on smaller LVLMs and subsequently transferring to larger models can achieve competitive performance while maintaining efficiency comparable to baseline methods. Our comprehensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed AdPO, which provides a novel perspective for future adversarial defense research.

- **[Text Speaks Louder than Vision: ASCII Art Reveals Textual Biases in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01589)**  `arXiv:2504.01589`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhaochen Wang, Yujun Cai, Zi Huang, Bryan Hooi, Yiwei Wang, Ming-Hsuan Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly in processing multimodal information, but their ability to reconcile conflicting signals across modalities remains underexplored. This work investigates how VLMs process ASCII art, a unique medium where textual elements collectively form visual patterns, potentially creating semantic-visual conflicts. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that systematically challenges five state-of-the-art models (including GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini) using adversarial ASCII art, where character-level semantics deliberately contradict global visual patterns. Our experiments reveal a strong text-priority bias: VLMs consistently prioritize textual information over visual patterns, with visual recognition ability declining dramatically as semantic complexity increases. Various mitigation attempts through visual parameter tuning and prompt engineering yielded only modest improvements, suggesting that this limitation requires architectural-level solutions. These findings uncover fundamental flaws in how current VLMs integrate multimodal information, providing important guidance for future model development while highlighting significant implications for content moderation systems vulnerable to adversarial examples.

- **[TimeSearch: Hierarchical Video Search with Spotlight and Reflection for Human-like Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01407)**  `arXiv:2504.01407`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Junwen Pan, Rui Zhang, Xin Wan, Yuan Zhang, Ming Lu, Qi She_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large video-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various video-language tasks. However, they encounter significant challenges when processing long videos because of the large number of video frames involved. Downsampling long videos in either space or time can lead to visual hallucinations, making it difficult to accurately interpret long videos. Motivated by human hierarchical temporal search strategies, we propose \textbf{TimeSearch}, a novel framework enabling LVLMs to understand long videos in a human-like manner. TimeSearch integrates two human-like primitives into a unified autoregressive LVLM: 1) \textbf{Spotlight} efficiently identifies relevant temporal events through a Temporal-Augmented Frame Representation (TAFR), explicitly binding visual features with timestamps; 2) \textbf{Reflection} evaluates the correctness of the identified events, leveraging the inherent temporal self-reflection capabilities of LVLMs. TimeSearch progressively explores key events and prioritizes temporal search based on reflection confidence. Extensive experiments on challenging long-video benchmarks confirm that TimeSearch substantially surpasses previous state-of-the-art, improving the accuracy from 41.8\% to 51.5\% on the LVBench. Additionally, experiments on temporal grounding demonstrate that appropriate TAFR is adequate to effectively stimulate the surprising temporal grounding ability of LVLMs in a simpler yet versatile manner, which improves mIoU on Charades-STA by 11.8\%. The code will be released.

- **[Towards Physically Plausible Video Generation via VLM Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23368)**  `arXiv:2503.23368`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Xindi Yang, Baolu Li, Yiming Zhang, Zhenfei Yin, Lei Bai, Liqian Ma, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video diffusion models (VDMs) have advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the generation of highly realistic videos and drawing the attention of the community in their potential as world simulators. However, despite their capabilities, VDMs often fail to produce physically plausible videos due to an inherent lack of understanding of physics, resulting in incorrect dynamics and event sequences. To address this limitation, we propose a novel two-stage image-to-video generation framework that explicitly incorporates physics. In the first stage, we employ a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a coarse-grained motion planner, integrating chain-of-thought and physics-aware reasoning to predict a rough motion trajectories/changes that approximate real-world physical dynamics while ensuring the inter-frame consistency. In the second stage, we use the predicted motion trajectories/changes to guide the video generation of a VDM. As the predicted motion trajectories/changes are rough, noise is added during inference to provide freedom to the VDM in generating motion with more fine details. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can produce physically plausible motion, and comparative evaluations highlight the notable superiority of our approach over existing methods.

- **[ILLUME+: Illuminating Unified MLLM with Dual Visual Tokenization and Diffusion Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01934)**  `arXiv:2504.01934`  `cs.CV`  
  _Runhui Huang, Chunwei Wang, Junwei Yang, Guansong Lu, Yunlong Yuan, Jianhua Han, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present ILLUME+ that leverages dual visual tokenization and a diffusion decoder to improve both deep semantic understanding and high-fidelity image generation. Existing unified models have struggled to simultaneously handle the three fundamental capabilities in a unified model: understanding, generation, and editing. Models like Chameleon and EMU3 utilize VQGAN for image discretization, due to the lack of deep semantic interaction, they lag behind specialist models like LLaVA in visual understanding tasks. To mitigate this, LaViT and ILLUME employ semantic encoders for tokenization, but they struggle with image editing due to poor texture preservation. Meanwhile, Janus series decouples the input and output image representation, limiting their abilities to seamlessly handle interleaved image-text understanding and generation. In contrast, ILLUME+ introduces a unified dual visual tokenizer, DualViTok, which preserves both fine-grained textures and text-aligned semantics while enabling a coarse-to-fine image representation strategy for multimodal understanding and generation. Additionally, we employ a diffusion model as the image detokenizer for enhanced generation quality and efficient super-resolution. ILLUME+ follows a continuous-input, discrete-output scheme within the unified MLLM and adopts a progressive training procedure that supports dynamic resolution across the vision tokenizer, MLLM, and diffusion decoder. This design allows for flexible and efficient context-aware image editing and generation across diverse tasks. ILLUME+ (3B) exhibits competitive performance against existing unified MLLMs and specialized models across multimodal understanding, generation, and editing benchmarks. With its strong performance, ILLUME+ provides a scalable and versatile foundation for future multimodal applications. Project Page:this https URL.

- **[Prompting Medical Vision-Language Models to Mitigate Diagnosis Bias by Generating Realistic Dermoscopic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01838)**  `arXiv:2504.01838`  `cs.CV`  
  _Nusrat Munia, Abdullah-Al-Zubaer Imran_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) in skin disease diagnosis has improved significantly, but a major concern is that these models frequently show biased performance across subgroups, especially regarding sensitive attributes such as skin color. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative AI-based framework, namely, Dermatology Diffusion Transformer (DermDiT), which leverages text prompts generated via Vision Language Models and multimodal text-image learning to generate new dermoscopic images. We utilize large vision language models to generate accurate and proper prompts for each dermoscopic image which helps to generate synthetic images to improve the representation of underrepresented groups (patient, disease, etc.) in highly imbalanced datasets for clinical diagnoses. Our extensive experimentation showcases the large vision language models providing much more insightful representations, that enable DermDiT to generate high-quality images.

- **[Spatial-R1: Enhancing MLLMs in Video Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01805)**  `arXiv:2504.01805`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kun Ouyang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Enhancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for video understanding is crucial yet challenging. We present Spatial-R1, a targeted approach involving two key contributions: the curation of SR, a new video spatial reasoning dataset from ScanNet with automatically generated QA pairs across seven task types, and the application of Task-Specific Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for fine-tuning. By training the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct model on SR using GRPO, Spatial-R1 significantly advances performance on the VSI-Bench benchmark, achieving a 7.4\% gain over the baseline and outperforming strong contemporary models. This work validates the effectiveness of specialized data curation and optimization techniques for improving complex spatial reasoning in video MLLMs.

- **[Slow-Fast Architecture for Video Multi-Modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01328)**  `arXiv:2504.01328`  `cs.CV`  
  _Min Shi, Shihao Wang, Chieh-Yun Chen, Jitesh Jain, Kai Wang, Junjun Xiong, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Balancing temporal resolution and spatial detail under limited compute budget remains a key challenge for video-based multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Existing methods typically compress video representations using predefined rules before feeding them into the LLM, resulting in irreversible information loss and often ignoring input instructions. To address this, we propose a novel slow-fast architecture that naturally circumvents this trade-off, enabling the use of more input frames while preserving spatial details. Inspired by how humans first skim a video before focusing on relevant parts, our slow-fast design employs a dual-token strategy: 1) "fast" visual tokens -- a compact set of compressed video features -- are fed into the LLM alongside text embeddings to provide a quick overview; 2) "slow" visual tokens -- uncompressed video features -- are cross-attended by text embeddings through specially designed hybrid decoder layers, enabling instruction-aware extraction of relevant visual details with linear complexity. We conduct systematic exploration to optimize both the overall architecture and key components. Experiments show that our model significantly outperforms self-attention-only baselines, extending the input capacity from 16 to 128 frames with just a 3% increase in computation, and achieving a 16% average performance improvement across five video understanding benchmarks. Our 7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of similar size. Furthermore, our slow-fast architecture is a plug-and-play design that can be integrated into other video MLLMs to improve efficiency and scalability.

- **[Safeguarding Vision-Language Models: Mitigating Vulnerabilities to Gaussian Noise in Perturbation-based Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01308)**  `arXiv:2504.01308`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jiawei Wang, Yushen Zuo, Yuanjun Chai, Zhendong Liu, Yichen Fu, Yichun Feng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating visual information, yet they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, especially when processing noisy or corrupted images. Although existing VLMs adopt security measures during training to mitigate such attacks, vulnerabilities associated with noise-augmented visual inputs are overlooked. In this work, we identify that missing noise-augmented training causes critical security gaps: many VLMs are susceptible to even simple perturbations such as Gaussian noise. To address this challenge, we propose Robust-VLGuard, a multimodal safety dataset with aligned / misaligned image-text pairs, combined with noise-augmented fine-tuning that reduces attack success rates while preserving functionality of VLM. For stronger optimization-based visual perturbation attacks, we propose DiffPure-VLM, leveraging diffusion models to convert adversarial perturbations into Gaussian-like noise, which can be defended by VLMs with noise-augmented safety fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the distribution-shifting property of diffusion model aligns well with our fine-tuned VLMs, significantly mitigating adversarial perturbations across varying intensities. The dataset and code are available atthis https URL.

- **[VGRP-Bench: Visual Grid Reasoning Puzzle Benchmark for Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23064)**  `arXiv:2503.23064`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) struggle with puzzles, which require precise perception, rule comprehension, and logical reasoning. Assessing and enhancing their performance in this domain is crucial, as it reflects their ability to engage in structured reasoning - an essential skill for real-world problem-solving. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate pre-trained models without additional training or fine-tuning, often lack a dedicated focus on reasoning, and fail to establish a systematic evaluation framework. To address these limitations, we introduce VGRP-Bench, a Visual Grid Reasoning Puzzle Benchmark featuring 20 diverse puzzles. VGRP-Bench spans multiple difficulty levels, and includes extensive experiments not only on existing chat LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), but also on reasoning LVLMs (e.g., Gemini-Thinking). Our results reveal that even the state-of-the-art LVLMs struggle with these puzzles, highlighting fundamental limitations in their puzzle-solving capabilities. Most importantly, through systematic experiments, we identify and analyze key factors influencing LVLMs' puzzle-solving performance, including the number of clues, grid size, and rule complexity. Furthermore, we explore two Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies that can be used in post-training: SFT on solutions (S-SFT) and SFT on synthetic reasoning processes (R-SFT). While both methods significantly improve performance on trained puzzles, they exhibit limited generalization to unseen ones. We will release VGRP-Bench to facilitate further research on LVLMs for complex, real-world problem-solving. Project page:this https URL.

- **[Cyclic Contrastive Knowledge Transfer for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11005)**  `arXiv:2503.11005`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chuhan Zhang, Chaoyang Zhu, Pingcheng Dong, Long Chen, Dong Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In pursuit of detecting unstinted objects that extend beyond predefined categories, prior arts of open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) typically resort to pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) for base-to-novel category generalization. However, to mitigate the misalignment between upstream image-text pretraining and downstream region-level perception, additional supervisions are indispensable, eg, image-text pairs or pseudo annotations generated via self-training strategies. In this work, we propose CCKT-Det trained without any extra supervision. The proposed framework constructs a cyclic and dynamic knowledge transfer from language queries and visual region features extracted from VLMs, which forces the detector to closely align with the visual-semantic space of VLMs. Specifically, 1) we prefilter and inject semantic priors to guide the learning of queries, and 2) introduce a regional contrastive loss to improve the awareness of queries on novel objects. CCKT-Det can consistently improve performance as the scale of VLMs increases, all while requiring the detector at a moderate level of computation overhead. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance gain of +2.9% and +10.2% AP50 over previous state-of-the-arts on the challenging COCO benchmark, both without and with a stronger teacher model.

- **[CoMM: A Coherent Interleaved Image-Text Dataset for Multimodal Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10462)**  `arXiv:2406.10462`  `cs.CV`  
  _Wei Chen, Lin Li, Yongqi Yang, Bin Wen, Fan Yang, Tingting Gao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Interleaved image-text generation has emerged as a crucial multimodal task, aiming at creating sequences of interleaved visual and textual content given a query. Despite notable advancements in recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs), generating integrated image-text sequences that exhibit narrative coherence and entity and style consistency remains challenging due to poor training data quality. To address this gap, we introduce CoMM, a high-quality Coherent interleaved image-text MultiModal dataset designed to enhance the coherence, consistency, and alignment of generated multimodal content. Initially, CoMM harnesses raw data from diverse sources, focusing on instructional content and visual storytelling, establishing a foundation for coherent and consistent content. To further refine the data quality, we devise a multi-perspective filter strategy that leverages advanced pre-trained models to ensure the development of sentences, consistency of inserted images, and semantic alignment between them. Various quality evaluation metrics are designed to prove the high quality of the filtered dataset. Meanwhile, extensive few-shot experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate CoMM's effectiveness in significantly enhancing the in-context learning capabilities of MLLMs. Moreover, we propose four new tasks to evaluate MLLMs' interleaved generation abilities, supported by a comprehensive evaluation framework. We believe CoMM opens a new avenue for advanced MLLMs with superior multimodal in-context learning and understanding ability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This survey presents a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenon of hallucination in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), also known as Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which have demonstrated significant advancements and remarkable abilities in multimodal tasks. Despite these promising developments, MLLMs often generate outputs that are inconsistent with the visual content, a challenge known as hallucination, which poses substantial obstacles to their practical deployment and raises concerns regarding their reliability in real-world applications. This problem has attracted increasing attention, prompting efforts to detect and mitigate such inaccuracies. We review recent advances in identifying, evaluating, and mitigating these hallucinations, offering a detailed overview of the underlying causes, evaluation benchmarks, metrics, and strategies developed to address this issue. Additionally, we analyze the current challenges and limitations, formulating open questions that delineate potential pathways for future research. By drawing the granular classification and landscapes of hallucination causes, evaluation benchmarks, and mitigation methods, this survey aims to deepen the understanding of hallucinations in MLLMs and inspire further advancements in the field. Through our thorough and in-depth review, we contribute to the ongoing dialogue on enhancing the robustness and reliability of MLLMs, providing valuable insights and resources for researchers and practitioners alike.

  _Weizhi Wang, Yu Tian, Linjie Yang, Heng Wang, Xifeng Yan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The reproduction of state-of-the-art multimodal LLM pre-training faces barriers at every stage of the pipeline, including high-quality data filtering, multimodal data mixture strategies, sequence packing techniques, and training frameworks. We introduce Open-Qwen2VL, a fully open-source 2B-parameter Multimodal Large Language Model pre-trained efficiently on 29M image-text pairs using only 220 A100-40G GPU hours. Our approach employs low-to-high dynamic image resolution and multimodal sequence packing to significantly enhance pre-training efficiency. The training dataset was carefully curated using both MLLM-based filtering techniques (e.g., MLM-Filter) and conventional CLIP-based filtering methods, substantially improving data quality and training efficiency. The Open-Qwen2VL pre-training is conducted on academic level 8xA100-40G GPUs at UCSB on 5B packed multimodal tokens, which is 0.36% of 1.4T multimodal pre-training tokens of Qwen2-VL. The final instruction-tuned Open-Qwen2VL outperforms partially-open state-of-the-art MLLM Qwen2-VL-2B on various multimodal benchmarks of MMBench, SEEDBench, MMstar, and MathVista, indicating the remarkable training efficiency of Open-Qwen2VL. We open-source all aspects of our work, including compute-efficient and data-efficient training details, data filtering methods, sequence packing scripts, pre-training data in WebDataset format, FSDP-based training codebase, and both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints. We redefine "fully open" for multimodal LLMs as the complete release of: 1) the training codebase, 2) detailed data filtering techniques, and 3) all pre-training and supervised fine-tuning data used to develop the model.

- **[Grounding Multimodal LLMs to Embodied Agents that Ask for Help with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00907)**  `arXiv:2504.00907`  `cs.AI`  
  _Ram Ramrakhya, Matthew Chang, Xavier Puig, Ruta Desai, Zsolt Kira, Roozbeh Mottaghi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Embodied agents operating in real-world environments must interpret ambiguous and under-specified human instructions. A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent must fetch a specific object instance given an ambiguous instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines, including GPT-4o, and supervised fine-tuned MLLMs, on our task. Our results demonstrate that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin ($19.1$-$40.3\%$), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.
