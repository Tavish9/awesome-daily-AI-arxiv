- **[Multi-modal Synthetic Data Training and Model Collapse: Insights from VLMs and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08803)**  `arXiv:2505.08803`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  Recent research has highlighted the risk of generative model collapse, where performance progressively degrades when continually trained on self-generated data. However, existing exploration on model collapse is limited to single, unimodal models, limiting our understanding in more realistic scenarios, such as diverse multi-modal AI agents interacting autonomously through synthetic data and continually evolving. We expand the synthetic data training and model collapse study to multi-modal vision-language generative systems, such as vision-language models (VLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models, as well as recursive generate-train loops with multiple models. We find that model collapse, previously observed in single-modality generative models, exhibits distinct characteristics in the multi-modal context, such as improved vision-language alignment and increased variance in VLM image-captioning task. Additionally, we find that general approaches such as increased decoding budgets, greater model diversity, and relabeling with frozen models can effectively mitigate model collapse. Our findings provide initial insights and practical guidelines for reducing the risk of model collapse in self-improving multi-agent AI systems and curating robust multi-modal synthetic datasets.

  In the domain of text-to-image generative models, biases inherent in training datasets often propagate into generated content, posing significant ethical challenges, particularly in socially sensitive contexts. We introduce FairCoT, a novel framework that enhances fairness in text-to-image models through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning within multimodal generative large language models. FairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement to systematically mitigate biases, and dynamically adjusts textual prompts in real time, ensuring diverse and equitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative reasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero-shot CoT in sensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility. Experimental evaluations across popular text-to-image systems--including DALL-E and various Stable Diffusion variants--demonstrate that FairCoT significantly enhances fairness and diversity without sacrificing image quality or semantic fidelity. By combining robust reasoning, lightweight deployment, and extensibility to multiple models, FairCoT represents a promising step toward more socially responsible and transparent AI-driven content generation.

  Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) is widely adopted in modern vehicles, yet its real-world performance remains underexplored due to proprietary systems and limited data access. This paper presents OpenLKA, the first open, large-scale dataset for LKA evaluation and improvement. It includes 400 hours of driving data from 50+ production vehicle models, collected through extensive road testing in Tampa, Florida and global contributions from thethis http URLdriving community. The dataset spans a wide range of challenging scenarios, including complex road geometries, degraded lane markings, adverse weather, lighting conditions and surrounding traffic. The dataset is multimodal, comprising: i) full CAN bus streams, decoded using custom reverse-engineered DBC files to extract key LKA events (e.g., system disengagements, lane detection failures); ii) synchronized high-resolution dash-cam video; iii) real-time outputs from Openpilot, providing accurate estimates of road curvature and lane positioning; iv) enhanced scene annotations generated by Vision Language Models, describing lane visibility, pavement quality, weather, lighting, and traffic conditions. By integrating vehicle-internal signals with high-fidelity perception and rich semantic context, OpenLKA provides a comprehensive platform for benchmarking the real-world performance of production LKA systems, identifying safety-critical operational scenarios, and assessing the readiness of current road infrastructure for autonomous driving. The dataset is publicly available at:this https URL.

- **[Prioritizing Image-Related Tokens Enhances Vision-Language Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08971)**  `arXiv:2505.08971`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Yangyi Chen, Hao Peng, Tong Zhang, Heng Ji_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In standard large vision-language models (LVLMs) pre-training, the model typically maximizes the joint probability of the caption conditioned on the image via next-token prediction (NTP); however, since only a small subset of caption tokens directly relates to the visual content, this naive NTP unintentionally fits the model to noise and increases the risk of hallucination. We present PRIOR, a simple vision-language pre-training approach that addresses this issue by prioritizing image-related tokens through differential weighting in the NTP loss, drawing from the importance sampling framework. PRIOR introduces a reference model-a text-only large language model (LLM) trained on the captions without image inputs, to weight each token based on its probability for LVLMs training. Intuitively, tokens that are directly related to the visual inputs are harder to predict without the image and thus receive lower probabilities from the text-only reference LLM. During training, we implement a token-specific re-weighting term based on the importance scores to adjust each token's loss. We implement PRIOR in two distinct settings: LVLMs with visual encoders and LVLMs without visual encoders. We observe 19% and 8% average relative improvement, respectively, on several vision-language benchmarks compared to NTP. In addition, PRIOR exhibits superior scaling properties, as demonstrated by significantly higher scaling coefficients, indicating greater potential for performance gains compared to NTP given increasing compute and data.

- **[Behind Maya: Building a Multilingual Vision Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08910)**  `arXiv:2505.08910`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Nahid Alam, Karthik Reddy Kanjula, Surya Guthikonda, Timothy Chung, Bala Krishna S Vegesna, Abhipsha Das, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent times, we have seen a rapid development of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). They have shown impressive results on academic benchmarks, primarily in widely spoken languages but lack performance on low-resource languages and varied cultural contexts. To address these limitations, we introduce Maya, an open-source Multilingual VLM. Our contributions are: 1) a multilingual image-text pretraining dataset in eight languages, based on the LLaVA pretraining dataset; and 2) a multilingual image-text model supporting these languages, enhancing cultural and linguistic comprehension in vision-language tasks.

  _Bo Zhang, Shuo Li, Runhe Tian, Yang Yang, Jixin Tang, Jinhao Zhou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce Flash-VL 2B, a novel approach to optimizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for real-time applications, targeting ultra-low latency and high throughput without sacrificing accuracy. Leveraging advanced architectural enhancements and efficient computational strategies, Flash-VL 2B is designed to maximize throughput by reducing processing time while maintaining competitive performance across multiple vision-language benchmarks. Our approach includes tailored architectural choices, token compression mechanisms, data curation, training schemes, and a novel image processing technique called implicit semantic stitching that effectively balances computational load and model performance. Through extensive evaluations on 11 standard VLM benchmarks, we demonstrate that Flash-VL 2B achieves state-of-the-art results in both speed and accuracy, making it a promising solution for deployment in resource-constrained environments and large-scale real-time applications.

- **[Towards Autonomous UAV Visual Object Search in City Space: Benchmark and Agentic Methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08765)**  `arXiv:2505.08765`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yatai Ji, Zhengqiu Zhu, Yong Zhao, Beidan Liu, Chen Gao, Yihao Zhao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aerial Visual Object Search (AVOS) tasks in urban environments require Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to autonomously search for and identify target objects using visual and textual cues without external guidance. Existing approaches struggle in complex urban environments due to redundant semantic processing, similar object distinction, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To bridge this gap and support the AVOS task, we introduce CityAVOS, the first benchmark dataset for autonomous search of common urban objects. This dataset comprises 2,420 tasks across six object categories with varying difficulty levels, enabling comprehensive evaluation of UAV agents' search capabilities. To solve the AVOS tasks, we also propose PRPSearcher (Perception-Reasoning-Planning Searcher), a novel agentic method powered by multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that mimics human three-tier cognition. Specifically, PRPSearcher constructs three specialized maps: an object-centric dynamic semantic map enhancing spatial perception, a 3D cognitive map based on semantic attraction values for target reasoning, and a 3D uncertainty map for balanced exploration-exploitation search. Also, our approach incorporates a denoising mechanism to mitigate interference from similar objects and utilizes an Inspiration Promote Thought (IPT) prompting mechanism for adaptive action planning. Experimental results on CityAVOS demonstrate that PRPSearcher surpasses existing baselines in both success rate and search efficiency (on average: +37.69% SR, +28.96% SPL, -30.69% MSS, and -46.40% NE). While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights the need for better semantic reasoning and spatial exploration capabilities in AVOS tasks. This work establishes a foundation for future advances in embodied target search. Dataset and source code are available atthis https URL.

- **[FaceShield: Explainable Face Anti-Spoofing with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09415)**  `arXiv:2505.09415`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hongyang Wang, Yichen Shi, Zhuofu Tao, Yuhao Gao, Liepiao Zhang, Xun Lin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for protecting facial recognition systems from presentation attacks. Previous methods approached this task as a classification problem, lacking interpretability and reasoning behind the predicted results. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and decision-making in visual tasks. However, there is currently no universal and comprehensive MLLM and dataset specifically designed for FAS task. To address this gap, we propose FaceShield, a MLLM for FAS, along with the corresponding pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, FaceShield-pre10K and FaceShield-sft45K. FaceShield is capable of determining the authenticity of faces, identifying types of spoofing attacks, providing reasoning for its judgments, and detecting attack areas. Specifically, we employ spoof-aware vision perception (SAVP) that incorporates both the original image and auxiliary information based on prior knowledge. We then use an prompt-guided vision token masking (PVTM) strategy to random mask vision tokens, thereby improving the model's generalization ability. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating that FaceShield significantly outperforms previous deep learning models and general MLLMs on four FAS tasks, i.e., coarse-grained classification, fine-grained classification, reasoning, and attack localization. Our instruction datasets, protocols, and codes will be released soon.

- **[Unsupervised Multiview Contrastive Language-Image Joint Learning with Pseudo-Labeled Prompts Via Vision-Language Model for 3D/4D Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09336)**  `arXiv:2505.09336`  `cs.CV`  
  _Muzammil Behzad_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce MultiviewVLM, a vision-language model designed for unsupervised contrastive multiview representation learning of facial emotions from 3D/4D data. Our architecture integrates pseudo-labels derived from generated textual prompts to guide implicit alignment of emotional semantics. To capture shared information across multi-views, we propose a joint embedding space that aligns multiview representations without requiring explicit supervision. We further enhance the discriminability of our model through a novel multiview contrastive learning strategy that leverages stable positive-negative pair sampling. A gradient-friendly loss function is introduced to promote smoother and more stable convergence, and the model is optimized for distributed training to ensure scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiviewVLM outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and can be easily adapted to various real-world applications with minimal modifications.

- **[Zero-Shot Multi-modal Large Language Model v.s. Supervised Deep Learning: A Comparative Study on CT-Based Intracranial Hemorrhage Subtyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09252)**  `arXiv:2505.09252`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Introduction: Timely identification of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) subtypes on non-contrast computed tomography is critical for prognosis prediction and therapeutic decision-making, yet remains challenging due to low contrast and blurring boundaries. This study evaluates the performance of zero-shot multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) compared to traditional deep learning methods in ICH binary classification and subtyping. Methods: We utilized a dataset provided by RSNA, comprising 192 NCCT volumes. The study compares various MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2, with conventional deep learning models, including ResNet50 and Vision Transformer. Carefully crafted prompts were used to guide MLLMs in tasks such as ICH presence, subtype classification, localization, and volume estimation. Results: The results indicate that in the ICH binary classification task, traditional deep learning models outperform MLLMs comprehensively. For subtype classification, MLLMs also exhibit inferior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, with Gemini 2.0 Flash achieving an macro-averaged precision of 0.41 and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.31. Conclusion: While MLLMs excel in interactive capabilities, their overall accuracy in ICH subtyping is inferior to deep networks. However, MLLMs enhance interpretability through language interactions, indicating potential in medical imaging analysis. Future efforts will focus on model refinement and developing more precise MLLMs to improve performance in three-dimensional medical image processing.

- **[AMSnet 2.0: A Large AMS Database with AI Segmentation for Net Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09155)**  `arXiv:2505.09155`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yichen Shi, Zhuofu Tao, Yuhao Gao, Li Huang, Hongyang Wang, Zhiping Yu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to understand circuit schematics due to their limited recognition capabilities. This could be attributed to the lack of high-quality schematic-netlist training data. Existing work such as AMSnet applies schematic parsing to generate netlists. However, these methods rely on hard-coded heuristics and are difficult to apply to complex or noisy schematics in this paper. We therefore propose a novel net detection mechanism based on segmentation with high robustness. The proposed method also recovers positional information, allowing digital reconstruction of schematics. We then expand AMSnet dataset with schematic images from various sources and create AMSnet 2.0. AMSnet 2.0 contains 2,686 circuits with schematic images, Spectre-formatted netlists, OpenAccess digital schematics, and positional information for circuit components and nets, whereas AMSnet only includes 792 circuits with SPICE netlists but no digital schematics.

- **[Beyond General Prompts: Automated Prompt Refinement using Contrastive Class Alignment Scores for Disambiguating Objects in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09139)**  `arXiv:2505.09139`  `cs.CV`  
  _Lucas Choi, Ross Greer_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) offer flexible object detection through natural language prompts but suffer from performance variability depending on prompt phrasing. In this paper, we introduce a method for automated prompt refinement using a novel metric called the Contrastive Class Alignment Score (CCAS), which ranks prompts based on their semantic alignment with a target object class while penalizing similarity to confounding classes. Our method generates diverse prompt candidates via a large language model and filters them through CCAS, computed using prompt embeddings from a sentence transformer. We evaluate our approach on challenging object categories, demonstrating that our automatic selection of high-precision prompts improves object detection accuracy without the need for additional model training or labeled data. This scalable and model-agnostic pipeline offers a principled alternative to manual prompt engineering for VLM-based detection systems.

- **[Seeing Beyond the Scene: Enhancing Vision-Language Models with Interactional Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09118)**  `arXiv:2505.09118`  `cs.CV`  
  _Dayong Liang, Changmeng Zheng, Zhiyuan Wen, Yi Cai, Xiao-Yong Wei, Qing Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional scene graphs primarily focus on spatial relationships, limiting vision-language models' (VLMs) ability to reason about complex interactions in visual scenes. This paper addresses two key challenges: (1) conventional detection-to-construction methods produce unfocused, contextually irrelevant relationship sets, and (2) existing approaches fail to form persistent memories for generalizing interaction reasoning to new scenes. We propose Interaction-augmented Scene Graph Reasoning (ISGR), a framework that enhances VLMs' interactional reasoning through three complementary components. First, our dual-stream graph constructor combines SAM-powered spatial relation extraction with interaction-aware captioning to generate functionally salient scene graphs with spatial grounding. Second, we employ targeted interaction queries to activate VLMs' latent knowledge of object functionalities, converting passive recognition into active reasoning about how objects work together. Finally, we introduce a lone-term memory reinforcement learning strategy with a specialized interaction-focused reward function that transforms transient patterns into long-term reasoning heuristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods on interaction-heavy reasoning benchmarks, with particularly strong improvements on complex scene understanding tasks.

- **[Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models on Fine-Grained Image Tasks: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14988)**  `arXiv:2504.14988`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hong-Tao Yu, Xiu-Shen Wei, Yuxin Peng, Serge Belongie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal perception capabilities, garnering significant attention. While numerous evaluation studies have emerged, assessing LVLMs both holistically and on specialized tasks, fine-grained image tasks-fundamental to computer vision-remain largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce a comprehensive fine-grained evaluation benchmark, i.e., FG-BMK, comprising 1.01 million questions and 0.33 million images. Our evaluation systematically examines LVLMs from both human-oriented and machine-oriented perspectives, focusing on their semantic recognition and fine-grained feature representation capabilities. Through extensive experiments on twelve representative LVLMs/VLMs, we uncover key findings regarding the influence of training paradigms, modality alignment, perturbation susceptibility, and fine-grained category reasoning on task performance. This work provides critical insights into the limitations of current LVLMs and offers guidance for future data construction and model design in the development of more advanced LVLMs. Our code is open-source and available atthis https URL.

- **[Video-R1: Reinforcing Video Reasoning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21776)**  `arXiv:2503.21776`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kaituo Feng, Kaixiong Gong, Bohao Li, Zonghao Guo, Yibing Wang, Tianshuo Peng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success in eliciting reasoning abilities through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce Video-R1 as the first attempt to systematically explore the R1 paradigm for incentivizing video reasoning within multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, directly applying RL training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-CoT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 37.1% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o.

- **[UI-R1: Enhancing Efficient Action Prediction of GUI Agents by Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21620)**  `arXiv:2503.21620`  `cs.AI`  
  _Zhengxi Lu, Yuxiang Chai, Yaxuan Guo, Xi Yin, Liang Liu, Hao Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent DeepSeek-R1 has showcased the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards. Despite its success in language models, its application in multi-modal domains, particularly in graphic user interface (GUI) agent tasks, remains under-explored. To address this issue, we propose UI-R1, the first framework to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI action prediction tasks. Specifically, UI-R1 introduces a novel rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). For efficient training, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed UI-R1-3B achieves significant improvements over the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks, with average accuracy gains of 22.1% on ScreenSpot, 6.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, and 12.7% on ANDROIDCONTROL. Furthermore, UI-R1-3B delivers competitive performance compared to larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B) trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K samples. We additionally develop an optimized version, UI-R1-E-3B, which significantly improves both grounding efficiency and accuracy. These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain. Code website:this https URL.
