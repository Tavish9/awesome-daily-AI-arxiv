- **[Structured Task Solving via Modular Embodied Intelligence: A Case Study on Rubik's Cube](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05607)**  `arXiv:2507.05607`  `cs.RO`  
  _Chongshan Fan, Shenghai Yuan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents Auto-RubikAI, a modular autonomous planning framework that integrates a symbolic Knowledge Base (KB), a vision-language model (VLM), and a large language model (LLM) to solve structured manipulation tasks exemplified by Rubik's Cube restoration. Unlike traditional robot systems based on predefined scripts, or modern approaches relying on pretrained networks and large-scale demonstration data, Auto-RubikAI enables interpretable, multi-step task execution with minimal data requirements and no prior demonstrations. The proposed system employs a KB module to solve group-theoretic restoration steps, overcoming LLMs' limitations in symbolic reasoning. A VLM parses RGB-D input to construct a semantic 3D scene representation, while the LLM generates structured robotic control code via prompt chaining. This tri-module architecture enables robust performance under spatial uncertainty. We deploy Auto-RubikAI in both simulation and real-world settings using a 7-DOF robotic arm, demonstrating effective Sim-to-Real adaptation without retraining. Experiments show a 79% end-to-end task success rate across randomized configurations. Compared to CFOP, DeepCubeA, and Two-Phase baselines, our KB-enhanced method reduces average solution steps while maintaining interpretability and safety. Auto-RubikAI provides a cost-efficient, modular foundation for embodied task planning in smart manufacturing, robotics education, and autonomous execution scenarios. Code, prompts, and hardware modules will be released upon publication.

  Enabling humanoid robots to reliably execute complex multi-step manipulation tasks is crucial for their effective deployment in industrial and household environments. This paper presents a hierarchical planning and control framework designed to achieve reliable multi-step humanoid manipulation. The proposed system comprises three layers: (1) a low-level RL-based controller responsible for tracking whole-body motion targets; (2) a mid-level set of skill policies trained via imitation learning that produce motion targets for different steps of a task; and (3) a high-level vision-language planning module that determines which skills should be executed and also monitors their completion in real-time using pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). Experimental validation is performed on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot executing a non-prehensile pick-and-place task. Over 40 real-world trials, the hierarchical system achieved a 73% success rate in completing the full manipulation sequence. These experiments confirm the feasibility of the proposed hierarchical system, highlighting the benefits of VLM-based skill planning and monitoring for multi-step manipulation scenarios.

- **[Towards General Continuous Memory for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17670)**  `arXiv:2505.17670`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Wenyi Wu, Zixuan Song, Kun Zhou, Yifei Shao, Zhiting Hu, Biwei Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models (LMs) and their extension, vision-language models (VLMs), have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. However, they still struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require multimodal or multilingual real-world knowledge. To support such capabilities, an external memory system that can efficiently provide relevant multimodal information is essential. Existing approaches generally concatenate image and text tokens into a long sequence as memory, which, however, may drastically increase context length and even degrade performance. In contrast, we propose using continuous memory, a compact set of dense embeddings to more effectively and efficiently represent multimodal and multilingual knowledge. Our key insight is that a VLM can serve as its own continuous memory encoder. We empirically show that this design improves performance on complex multimodal reasoning tasks. Building on this, we introduce a data-efficient and parameter-efficient method to fine-tune the VLM into a memory encoder, requiring only 1.2% of the model's parameters and a small corpus of 15.6K self-synthesized samples. Our approach CoMEM utilizes VLM's original capabilities to encode arbitrary multimodal and multilingual knowledge into just 8 continuous embeddings. Since the inference-time VLM remains frozen, our memory module is plug-and-play and can be flexibly integrated as needed. Extensive experiments across eight multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **[Beyond Communication Overhead: A Multilevel Monte Carlo Approach for Mitigating Compression Bias in Distributed Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05508)**  `arXiv:2507.05508`  `cs.LG`  
  _Ze'ev Zukerman, Bassel Hamoud, Kfir Y. Levy_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Distributed learning methods have gained substantial momentum in recent years, with communication overhead often emerging as a critical bottleneck. Gradient compression techniques alleviate communication costs but involve an inherent trade-off between the empirical efficiency of biased compressors and the theoretical guarantees of unbiased compressors. In this work, we introduce a novel Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) compression scheme that leverages biased compressors to construct statistically unbiased estimates. This approach effectively bridges the gap between biased and unbiased methods, combining the strengths of both. To showcase the versatility of our method, we apply it to popular compressors, like Top-$k$ and bit-wise compressors, resulting in enhanced variants. Furthermore, we derive an adaptive version of our approach to further improve its performance. We validate our method empirically on distributed deep learning tasks.

- **[pFedMMA: Personalized Federated Fine-Tuning with Multi-Modal Adapter for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05394)**  `arXiv:2507.05394`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Sajjad Ghiasvand, Mahnoosh Alizadeh, Ramtin Pedarsani_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our asymmetric optimization strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared component is exchanged during rounds. Through extensive experiments across eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods. The code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Visual Adaptive Prompting for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20292)**  `arXiv:2502.20292`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Kyle Stein, Arash Mahyari, Guillermo Francia, Eman El-Sheikh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal capabilities in learning joint representations of visual and textual data, making them powerful tools for tasks such as Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL). CZSL requires models to generalize to novel combinations of visual primitives--such as attributes and objects--that were not explicitly encountered during training. Recent works in prompting for CZSL have focused on modifying inputs for the text encoder, often using static prompts that do not change across varying visual contexts. However, these approaches struggle to fully capture varying visual contexts, as they focus on text adaptation rather than leveraging visual features for compositional reasoning. To address this, we propose a Visual Adaptive Prompting System (VAPS) that leverages a learnable visual prompt repository and similarity-based retrieval mechanism within the framework of VLMs to bridge the gap between semantic and visual features. Our method introduces a dynamic visual prompt repository mechanism that selects the most relevant attribute and object prompts based on the visual features of the image. Our proposed system includes a visual prompt adapter that encourages the model to learn a more generalizable embedding space. Experiments on three CZSL benchmarks, across both closed and open-world scenarios, demonstrate state-of-the-art results.

- **[CultureCLIP: Empowering CLIP with Cultural Awareness through Synthetic Images and Contextualized Captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06210)**  `arXiv:2507.06210`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Yuchen Huang, Zhiyuan Fan, Zhitao He, Sandeep Polisetty, Wenyan Li, Yi R. Fung_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in multimodal understanding but struggle with contextually relevant fine-grained visual features, making it difficult to distinguish visually similar yet culturally distinct concepts. This limitation stems from the scarcity of high-quality culture-specific datasets, the lack of integrated contextual knowledge, and the absence of hard negatives highlighting subtle distinctions. To address these challenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but represent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to create CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced captions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling finer cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities. Experiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained concept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.

- **[Llama Nemoretriever Colembed: Top-Performing Text-Image Retrieval Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05513)**  `arXiv:2507.05513`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Mengyao Xu, Gabriel Moreira, Ronay Ak, Radek Osmulski, Yauhen Babakhin, Zhiding Yu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Motivated by the growing demand for retrieval systems that operate across modalities, we introduce llama-nemoretriever-colembed, a unified text-image retrieval model that delivers state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. We release two model variants, 1B and 3B. The 3B model achieves state of the art performance, scoring NDCG@5 91.0 on ViDoRe V1 and 63.5 on ViDoRe V2, placing first on both leaderboards as of June 27, 2025.Our approach leverages the NVIDIA Eagle2 Vision-Language model (VLM), modifies its architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional attention, and integrates a ColBERT-style late interaction mechanism to enable fine-grained multimodal retrieval in a shared embedding space. While this mechanism delivers superior retrieval accuracy, it introduces trade-offs in storage and efficiency. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these trade-offs. Additionally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the model's retrieval capabilities.

- **[Fine-Grained Knowledge Structuring and Retrieval for Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20964)**  `arXiv:2502.20964`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhengxuan Zhang, Yin Wu, Yuyu Luo, Nan Tang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Question Answering (VQA) focuses on providing answers to natural language questions by utilizing information from images. Although cutting-edge multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o achieve strong performance on VQA tasks, they frequently fall short in accessing domain-specific or the latest knowledge. To mitigate this issue, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) leveraging external knowledge bases (KBs), referred to as KB-VQA, emerges as a promising approach. Nevertheless, conventional unimodal retrieval techniques, which translate images into textual descriptions, often result in the loss of critical visual details. To address these challenges, this study presents two key innovations. First, we introduce fine-grained knowledge units that consist of multimodal data fragments (e.g. text fragments, entity images, and so on) in a structured manner. Rather than merely refining retrieval mechanisms, we prioritize the systematic organization and management of these knowledge units, ensuring that the structuring process itself enhances retrieval quality. Second, we propose a knowledge unit retrieval-augmented generation framework (KU-RAG) that seamlessly integrates fine-grained retrieval with MLLMs. Our KU-RAG framework not only ensures precise retrieval of relevant knowledge but also enhances reasoning capabilities through a knowledge correction chain. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing KB-VQA methods across four benchmarks, achieving an average improvement of approximately 3% and up to 11% in the best case.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Technical reports and articles often contain valuable information in the form of semi-structured data like charts, and figures. Interpreting these and using the information from them is essential for downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Current approaches to visual question answering often struggle with the precision required for scientific data interpretation, particularly in handling numerical values, multi-step reasoning over visual elements, and maintaining consistency between visual observation and textual reasoning. We present our approach to the SciVQA 2025 shared task, focusing on answering visual and non-visual questions grounded in scientific figures from scholarly articles.We conducted a series of experiments using models with 5B to 8B parameters. Our strongest individual model, InternVL3, achieved ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L F1 scores of \textbf{0.740} and a BERTScore of \textbf{0.983} on the SciVQA test split. We also developed an ensemble model with multiple vision language models (VLMs). Through error analysis on the validation split, our ensemble approach improved performance compared to most individual models, though InternVL3 remained the strongest standalone performer. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of prompt optimization, chain-of-thought reasoning and ensemble modeling in improving the model's ability in visual question answering.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Notable breakthroughs in unified understanding and generation modeling have led to remarkable advancements in image understanding, reasoning, production and editing, yet current foundational models predominantly focus on processing images, creating a gap in the development of unified models for video understanding and generation. This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.

- **[GeoMag: A Vision-Language Model for Pixel-level Fine-Grained Remote Sensing Image Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05887)**  `arXiv:2507.05887`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xianzhi Ma, Jianhui Li, Changhua Pei, Hao Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) image understanding has achieved notable progress, demonstrating the basic ability to recognize and describe geographical entities. However, existing RS-VLMs are mostly limited to image-level and region-level tasks, lacking the capability to handle pixel-level tasks and performing poorly in small-object recognition scenarios. Moreover, RS-VLMs consume significant computational resources when processing high-resolution RS images, further restricting their practical applicability. In this context, we propose GeoMag (Geographical Magnifier), an end-to-end general-purpose large model framework for RS. GeoMag dynamically focuses the attention scope based on prompt semantics to effectively perform remote sensing image parsing across multiple levels of granularity. This method introduces Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC), which adaptively reduce the spatial resolution of task-irrelevant regions while enhancing the visual representation of task-relevant areas. This approach improves the model's perception of critical target regions, suppresses background redundancy, and reduces the computational cost of interpreting high-resolution RS imagery. Extensive comparative experiments on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that GeoMag not only excels in handling pixel-level tasks but also maintains competitive performance across tasks of other granularities compared to existing RS-VLMs.

- **[SPADE: Spatial-Aware Denoising Network for Open-vocabulary Panoptic Scene Graph Generation with Long- and Local-range Context Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05798)**  `arXiv:2507.05798`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xin Hu, Ke Qin, Guiduo Duan, Ming Li, Yuan-Fang Li, Tao He_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) integrates instance segmentation with relation understanding to capture pixel-level structural relationships in complex scenes. Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork) framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2) spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries. Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.

- **[Integrated Structural Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05677)**  `arXiv:2507.05677`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jiahui Wang, Qin Xu, Bo Jiang, Bin Luo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt learning methods have significantly extended the transferability of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide text or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works ignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within and between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new classes remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of information representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural relationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across modalities. This enables efficient information transfer while preserving feature stability. Additionally, we propose a sample probing module that dynamically adjusts loss coefficients based on sample difficulty, preventing the mode from overfitting to simple samples and improving generalization ability to new classes. Extensive experiments on three widely used settings: base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization demonstrate that the proposed ISP achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.

- **[R-VLM: Region-Aware Vision Language Model for Precise GUI Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05673)**  `arXiv:2507.05673`  `cs.CV`  
  _Joonhyung Park, Peng Tang, Sagnik Das, Srikar Appalaraju, Kunwar Yashraj Singh, R. Manmatha, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual agent models for automating human activities on Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) have emerged as a promising research direction, driven by advances in large Vision Language Models (VLMs). A critical challenge in GUI automation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse platforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large and cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant information that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches typically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives, which fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established object detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these issues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages zoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an IoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU predictions. Our approach bridges the gap between VLMs and conventional object detection techniques, improving the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy by 13% across diverse GUI platforms on the GUI grounding benchmarks ScreenSpot and AgentStudio. In addition, our R-VLM approach shows 3.2-9.7% absolute accuracy improvements in GUI navigation tasks on the AITW and Mind2Web benchmarks.

- **[Dynamic Rank Adaptation for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05668)**  `arXiv:2507.05668`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jiahui Wang, Qin Xu, Bo Jiang, Bin Luo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP demonstrate impressive generalization ability. Existing prompt-based and adapter-based works have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the challenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards unseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating all tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting on less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and degrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept recognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a novel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class generalization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the importance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first employs token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and group tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to the importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature ranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response mechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels identified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1 regularization term is introduced to stabilize the training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DRA over existing works, especially on enhancing the performance of new classes on various benchmarks, including base-new classes, cross-datasets evaluation and domain generalization. The source code will be published after the paper is received.

  Graphic design is crucial for conveying ideas and messages. Designers usually organize their work into objects, backgrounds, and vectorized text layers to simplify editing. However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With the rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in pixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack editability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers, influencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the creation of layered designs. Motivated by this observation, we propose Accordion, a graphic design generation framework taking the first attempt to convert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs, meanwhile refining nonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user prompts. It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct roles in three curated stages. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the VLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods (e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered designs, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually harmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer. Additionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element removal models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers. We train our method using the in-house graphic design dataset Design39K, augmented with AI-generated design images coupled with refined ground truth created by a customized inpainting model. Experimental results and user studies by designers show that Accordion generates favorable results on the DesignIntention benchmark, including tasks such as text-to-template, adding text to background, and text de-rendering, and also excels in creating design variations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to segment objects based on open-ended language prompts remains a critical challenge, requiring models to ground textual semantics into precise spatial masks while handling diverse and unseen categories. We present OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks. ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances. iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities, generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks, including ADE20k, PASCAL, ScanNet, and SUN-RGBD.

  Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced out-of-distribution (OOD) detection recently. However, existing CLIP-based methods often focus on learning OOD-related knowledge to improve OOD detection, showing limited generalization or reliance on external large-scale auxiliary datasets. In this study, instead of delving into the intricate OOD-related knowledge, we propose an innovative CLIP-based framework based on Forced prompt leArning (FA), designed to make full use of the In-Distribution (ID) knowledge and ultimately boost the effectiveness of OOD detection. Our key insight is to learn a prompt (i.e., forced prompt) that contains more diversified and richer descriptions of the ID classes beyond the textual semantics of class labels. Specifically, it promotes better discernment for ID images, by forcing more notable semantic similarity between ID images and the learnable forced prompt. Moreover, we introduce a forced coefficient, encouraging the forced prompt to learn more comprehensive and nuanced descriptions of the ID classes. In this way, FA is capable of achieving notable improvements in OOD detection, even when trained without any external auxiliary datasets, while maintaining an identical number of trainable parameters as CoOp. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm our method consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Code is available atthis https URL.

  While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions: (1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3) How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context? Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique challenges posed by surgery.

  Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive performance on VAD benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the UBnormal dataset and outperforming other methods in generalization across all datasets.

  We introduce Skywork-R1V3, an advanced, open-source vision-language model (VLM) that pioneers a new approach to visual reasoning. Its key innovation lies in effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language Models (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily stems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively activates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for additional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover the fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal alignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique indicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens, which has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training. Skywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving from 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities. Remarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B parameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation successfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related reasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and reinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on multimodal reasoning. Skywork-R1V3 represents a significant leap in multimodal reasoning, showcasing RL as a powerful engine for advancing open-source VLM capabilities.

  Integrating structured graph data with rich textual information from nodes poses a significant challenge, particularly for heterophilic node classification. Current approaches often struggle with computational costs or effective fusion of disparate modalities. We propose \textbf{Graph Masked Language Model (GMLM)}, a novel architecture efficiently combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). GMLM introduces three key innovations: (i) a \textbf{dynamic active node selection} strategy for scalable PLM text processing; (ii) a GNN-specific \textbf{contrastive pretraining stage} using soft masking with a learnable graph \texttt{[MASK]} token for robust structural representations; and (iii) a \textbf{dedicated fusion module} integrating RGCN-based GNN embeddings with PLM (GTE-Small \& DistilBERT) embeddings. Extensive experiments on heterophilic benchmarks (Cornell, Wisconsin, Texas) demonstrate GMLM's superiority. Notably, GMLM(DistilBERT) achieves significant performance gains, improving accuracy by over \textbf{4.7\%} on Cornell and over \textbf{2.0\%} on Texas compared to the previous best-performing baselines. This work underscores the benefits of targeted PLM engagement and modality-specific pretraining for improved, efficient learning on text-rich graphs.

  One of the main objectives in developing large vision-language models (LVLMs) is to engineer systems that can assist humans with multimodal tasks, including interpreting descriptions of perceptual experiences. A central phenomenon in this context is amodal completion, in which people perceive objects even when parts of those objects are hidden. Although numerous studies have assessed whether computer-vision algorithms can detect or reconstruct occluded regions, the inferential abilities of LVLMs on texts related to amodal completion remain unexplored. To address this gap, we constructed a benchmark grounded in Basic Formal Ontology to achieve a systematic classification of amodal completion. Our results indicate that while many LVLMs achieve human-comparable performance overall, their accuracy diverges for certain types of objects being completed. Notably, in certain categories, some LLaVA-NeXT variants and Claude 3.5 Sonnet exhibit lower accuracy on original images compared to blank stimuli lacking visual content. Intriguingly, this disparity emerges only under Japanese prompting, suggesting a deficiency in Japanese-specific linguistic competence among these models.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for enabling AI-powered smart assistants to interpret and reason in multimodal environments. However, their application in augmented reality (AR) training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive dataset tailored for AR training, featuring systematized vision-language tasks, and evaluate nine state-of-the-art VLMs on it. Our results reveal that even advanced models, including GPT-4o, struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, achieving a maximum F1 score of just 40.54% on state detection. These findings highlight the demand for enhanced datasets, benchmarks, and further research to improve fine-grained vision-language alignment. Beyond technical contributions, our work has broader social implications, particularly in empowering blind and visually impaired users with equitable access to AI-driven learning opportunities. We provide all related resources, including the dataset, source code, and evaluation results, to support the research community.

  We present BlueLM-2.5-3B, a compact and unified dense Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed for efficient edge-device deployment, offering strong general-purpose and reasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 3B-scale MLLM to support both thinking and non-thinking modes, while also enabling explicit control over thinking token budget. BlueLM-2.5-3B is developed through diversified data curation, key data resampling, hybrid heterogeneous reinforcement learning, and a high-performance training infrastructure. Our model achieves superior multimodal capacity while preserving competitive pure-text performance with only 2.9 billion parameters. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a broad range of multimodal and text-only benchmarks. In thinking mode, BlueLM-2.5-3B achieves comparable performance to Qwen3-4B on text-only benchmarks, and trails the larger Kimi-VL-A3B-16B by only about 5% on average across multimodal evaluations. In non-thinking mode, it outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B on the majority of multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, BlueLM-2.5-3B exhibits exceptional data efficiency. All of the aforementioned performance is achieved with substantially less total training data than Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen3-4B. We hope our work contributes to the advancement of high-performance, on-device MLLMs and provides meaningful insights to the research community.

  Automated depression diagnosis aims to analyze multimodal information from interview videos to predict participants' depression scores. Previous studies often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former). Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.
