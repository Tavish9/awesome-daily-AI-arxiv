- **[Enhancing Generalization in Vision-Language-Action Models by Preserving Pretrained Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11417)**  `arXiv:2509.11417`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  Vision-language-action (VLA) models finetuned from vision-language models (VLMs) hold the promise of leveraging rich pretrained representations to build generalist robots across diverse tasks and environments. However, direct fine-tuning on robot data often disrupts these representations and limits generalization. We present a framework that better preserves pretrained features while adapting them for robot manipulation. Our approach introduces three components: (i) a dual-encoder design with one frozen vision encoder to retain pretrained features and another trainable for task adaptation, (ii) a string-based action tokenizer that casts continuous actions into character sequences aligned with the model's pretraining domain, and (iii) a co-training strategy that combines robot demonstrations with vision-language datasets emphasizing spatial reasoning and affordances. Evaluations in simulation and on real robots show that our method improves robustness to visual perturbations, generalization to novel instructions and environments, and overall task success compared to baselines.

- **[Large Foundation Models for Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10570)**  `arXiv:2509.10570`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Trajectory prediction serves as a critical functionality in autonomous driving, enabling the anticipation of future motion paths for traffic participants such as vehicles and pedestrians, which is essential for driving safety. Although conventional deep learning methods have improved accuracy, they remain hindered by inherent limitations, including lack of interpretability, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated data, and weak generalization in long-tail scenarios. The rise of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) is transforming the research paradigm of trajectory prediction. This survey offers a systematic review of recent advances in LFMs, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for trajectory prediction. By integrating linguistic and scene semantics, LFMs facilitate interpretable contextual reasoning, significantly enhancing prediction safety and generalization in complex environments. The article highlights three core methodologies: trajectory-language mapping, multimodal fusion, and constraint-based reasoning. It covers prediction tasks for both vehicles and pedestrians, evaluation metrics, and dataset analyses. Key challenges such as computational latency, data scarcity, and real-world robustness are discussed, along with future research directions including low-latency inference, causality-aware modeling, and motion foundation models.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for end-to-end autonomous driving. However, the field still lacks a practical platform that enables dynamic model updates, rapid validation, fair comparison, and intuitive performance assessment. To that end, we introduce LightEMMA, a Lightweight End-to-End Multimodal Model for Autonomous driving. LightEMMA provides a unified, VLM-based autonomous driving framework without ad hoc customizations, enabling easy integration with evolving state-of-the-art commercial and open-source models. We construct twelve autonomous driving agents using various VLMs and evaluate their performance on the challenging nuScenes prediction task, comprehensively assessing computational metrics and providing critical insights. Illustrative examples show that, although VLMs exhibit strong scenario interpretation capabilities, their practical performance in autonomous driving tasks remains a concern. Additionally, increased model complexity and extended reasoning do not necessarily lead to better performance, emphasizing the need for further improvements and task-specific designs.

- **[Embodied Navigation Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12129)**  `arXiv:2509.12129`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Navigation is a fundamental capability in embodied AI, representing the intelligence required to perceive and interact within physical environments following language instructions. Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While foundation models show remarkable progress in language and vision, existing vision-language models (VLMs) still have limited spatial and embodiment understanding. Transferring VLMs to embodied domains reveals fundamental mismatches between modalities, pretraining distributions, and training objectives, leaving action comprehension and generation as a central bottleneck on the path to AGI.We introduce WALL-OSS, an end-to-end embodied foundation model that leverages large-scale multimodal pretraining to achieve (1) embodiment-aware vision-language understanding, (2) strong language-action association, and (3) robust manipulation capability.Our approach employs a tightly coupled architecture and multi-strategies training curriculum that enables Unified Cross-Level CoT-seamlessly unifying instruction reasoning, subgoal decomposition, and fine-grained action synthesis within a single differentiable framework.Our results show that WALL-OSS attains high success on complex long-horizon manipulations, demonstrates strong instruction-following capabilities, complex understanding and reasoning, and outperforms strong baselines, thereby providing a reliable and scalable path from VLMs to embodied foundation models.

- **[ActivePose: Active 6D Object Pose Estimation and Tracking for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11364)**  `arXiv:2509.11364`  `cs.RO`  
  _Sheng Liu, Zhe Li, Weiheng Wang, Han Sun, Heng Zhang, Hongpeng Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate 6-DoF object pose estimation and tracking are critical for reliable robotic manipulation. However, zero-shot methods often fail under viewpoint-induced ambiguities and fixed-camera setups struggle when objects move or become self-occluded. To address these challenges, we propose an active pose estimation pipeline that combines a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with "robotic imagination" to dynamically detect and resolve ambiguities in real time. In an offline stage, we render a dense set of views of the CAD model, compute the FoundationPose entropy for each view, and construct a geometric-aware prompt that includes low-entropy (unambiguous) and high-entropy (ambiguous) examples. At runtime, the system: (1) queries the VLM on the live image for an ambiguity score; (2) if ambiguity is detected, imagines a discrete set of candidate camera poses by rendering virtual views, scores each based on a weighted combination of VLM ambiguity probability and FoundationPose entropy, and then moves the camera to the Next-Best-View (NBV) to obtain a disambiguated pose estimation. Furthermore, since moving objects may leave the camera's field of view, we introduce an active pose tracking module: a diffusion-policy trained via imitation learning, which generates camera trajectories that preserve object visibility and minimize pose ambiguity. Experiments in simulation and real-world show that our approach significantly outperforms classical baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To perform outdoor autonomous visual navigation and search, a robot may leverage satellite imagery as a prior map. This can help inform high-level search and exploration strategies, even when such images lack sufficient resolution to allow for visual recognition of targets. However, there are limited training datasets of satellite images with annotated targets that are not directly visible. Furthermore, approaches which leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs) for generalization may yield inaccurate outputs due to hallucination, leading to inefficient search. To address these challenges, we introduce Search-TTA, a multimodal test-time adaptation framework with a flexible plug-and-play interface compatible with various input modalities (e.g. image, text, sound) and planning methods. First, we pretrain a satellite image encoder to align with CLIP's visual encoder to output probability distributions of target presence used for visual search. Second, our framework dynamically refines CLIP's predictions during search using a test-time adaptation mechanism. Through a novel feedback loop inspired by Spatial Poisson Point Processes, uncertainty-weighted gradient updates are used to correct potentially inaccurate predictions and improve search performance. To train and evaluate Search-TTA, we curate AVS-Bench, a visual search dataset based on internet-scale ecological data that contains up to 380k training and 8k validation images (in- and out-domain). We find that Search-TTA improves planner performance by up to 30.0%, particularly in cases with poor initial CLIP predictions due to limited training data. It also performs comparably with significantly larger VLMs, and achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen modalities. Finally, we deploy Search-TTA on a real UAV via hardware-in-the-loop testing, by simulating its operation within a large-scale simulation that provides onboard sensing.

- **[Training-free Task-oriented Grasp Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04873)**  `arXiv:2502.04873`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a training-free pipeline for task-oriented grasp generation that combines pre-trained grasp generation models with vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional approaches that focus solely on stable grasps, our method incorporates task-specific requirements by leveraging the semantic reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We evaluate five querying strategies, each utilizing different visual representations of candidate grasps, and demonstrate significant improvements over a baseline method in both grasp success and task compliance rates, with absolute gains of up to 36.9\% in overall success rate. Our results underline the potential of VLMs to enhance task-oriented manipulation, providing insights for future research in robotic grasping and human-robot interaction.

  _Suhang Hu, Wei Hu, Yuhang Su, Fan Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks, such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training. We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations, achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring manually annotatedthis http URLand resources are available at:this https URL.

- **[Measuring Visual Understanding in Telecom domain: Performance Metrics for Image-to-UML conversion using VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11667)**  `arXiv:2509.11667`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _HG Ranjani, Rutuja Prabhudesai_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Telecom domain 3GPP documents are replete with images containing sequence diagrams. Advances in Vision-Language Large Models (VLMs) have eased conversion of such images to machine-readable PlantUML (puml) formats. However, there is a gap in evaluation of such conversions - existing works do not compare puml scripts for various components. In this work, we propose performance metrics to measure the effectiveness of such conversions. A dataset of sequence diagrams from 3GPP documents is chosen to be representative of domain-specific actual scenarios. We compare puml outputs from two VLMs - Claude Sonnet and GPT-4V - against manually created ground truth representations. We use version control tools to capture differences and introduce standard performance metrics to measure accuracies along various components: participant identification, message flow accuracy, sequence ordering, and grouping construct preservation. We demonstrate effectiveness of proposed metrics in quantifying conversion errors across various components of puml scripts. The results show that nodes, edges and messages are accurately captured. However, we observe that VLMs do not necessarily perform well on complex structures such as notes, box, groups. Our experiments and performance metrics indicates a need for better representation of these components in training data for fine-tuned VLMs.

- **[Rethinking Sparse Autoencoders: Select-and-Project for Fairness and Control from Encoder Features Alone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10809)**  `arXiv:2509.10809`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven valuable due to their ability to provide interpretable and steerable representations. Current debiasing methods based on SAEs manipulate these sparse activations presuming that feature representations are housed within decoder weights. We challenge this fundamental assumption and introduce an encoder-focused alternative for representation debiasing, contributing three key findings: (i) we highlight an unconventional SAE feature selection strategy, (ii) we propose a novel SAE debiasing methodology that orthogonalizes input embeddings against encoder weights, and (iii) we establish a performance-preserving mechanism during debiasing through encoder weight interpolation. Our Selection and Projection framework, termed S\&P TopK, surpasses conventional SAE usage in fairness metrics by a factor of up to 3.2 and advances state-of-the-art test-time VLM debiasing results by a factor of up to 1.8 while maintaining downstream performance.

- **[Test-Time Warmup for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10641)**  `arXiv:2509.10641`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Nikita Rajaneesh, Thomas Zollo, Richard Zemel_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder, and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up' before inference can enhance MLLMs' robustness across diverse reasoning tasks.

  _Pu Jian, Junhong Wu, Wei Sun, Chen Wang, Shuo Ren, Jiajun Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in text-only "slow-thinking" reasoning have prompted efforts to transfer this capability to vision-language models (VLMs), for training visual reasoning models (\textbf{VRMs}). owever, such transfer faces critical challenges: Effective "slow thinking" in VRMs requires \textbf{visual reflection}, the ability to check the reasoning process based on visual information. Through quantitative analysis, we observe that current VRMs exhibit limited visual reflection, as their attention to visual information diminishes rapidly with longer generated responses. To address this challenge, we propose a new VRM \textbf{Reflection-V}, which enhances visual reflection based on reasoning data construction for cold-start and reward design for reinforcement learning (RL). Firstly, we construct vision-centered reasoning data by leveraging an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs, enabling cold-start learning of visual reflection patterns. Secondly, a visual attention based reward model is employed during RL to encourage reasoning based on visual information. Therefore, \textbf{Reflection-V} demonstrates significant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, \textbf{Reflection-V} maintains a stronger and more consistent reliance on visual information during visual reasoning, indicating effective enhancement in visual reflection capabilities.

- **[Lost in Embeddings: Information Loss in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11986)**  `arXiv:2509.11986`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Wenyan Li, Raphael Tang, Chengzu Li, Caiqi Zhang, Ivan Vuliƒá, Anders S√∏gaard_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision--language models (VLMs) often process visual inputs through a pretrained vision encoder, followed by a projection into the language model's embedding space via a connector component. While crucial for modality fusion, the potential information loss induced by this projection step and its direct impact on model capabilities remain understudied. We introduce two complementary approaches to examine and quantify this loss by analyzing the latent representation space. First, we evaluate semantic information preservation by analyzing changes in k-nearest neighbor relationships between image representations, before and after projection. Second, we directly measure information loss by reconstructing visual embeddings from the projected representation, localizing loss at an image patch level. Experiments reveal that connectors substantially distort the local geometry of visual representations, with k-nearest neighbors diverging by 40--60\% post-projection, correlating with degradation in retrieval performance. The patch-level embedding reconstruction provides interpretable insights for model behavior on visually grounded question-answering tasks, finding that areas of high information loss reliably predict instances where models struggle.

- **[Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by Self-Injecting Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11287)**  `arXiv:2509.11287`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Yifan Lu, Ziqi Zhang, Chunfeng Yuan, Jun Gao, Congxuan Zhang, Xiaojuan Qi, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from serious hallucination problems, where the model-generated responses are inconsistent with the visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on preference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models for preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable improvement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference Alignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that mitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a pair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection process, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key observations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination patterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination mitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training strategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the preference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous enhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that APASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models but also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based methods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization capability.

- **[Bridging Vision Language Models and Symbolic Grounding for Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11862)**  `arXiv:2509.11862`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video Question Answering (VQA) requires models to reason over spatial, temporal, and causal cues in videos. Recent vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong results but often rely on shallow correlations, leading to weak temporal grounding and limited interpretability. We study symbolic scene graphs (SGs) as intermediate grounding signals for VQA. SGs provide structured object-relation representations that complement VLMs holistic reasoning. We introduce SG-VLM, a modular framework that integrates frozen VLMs with scene graph grounding via prompting and visual localization. Across three benchmarks (NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), SG-VLM improves causal and temporal reasoning and outperforms prior baselines, though gains over strong VLMs are limited. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of symbolic grounding, and offer guidance for future hybrid VLM-symbolic approaches in video understanding.

  _Rynaa Grover, Jayant Sravan Tamarapalli, Sahiti Yerramilli, Nilay Pande_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on multimodal tasks. However, they still suffer from hallucinations, generating text inconsistent with visual input, posing significant risks in real-world applications. Existing approaches to address this issue focus on incorporating external knowledge bases, alignment training, or decoding strategies, all of which require substantial computational cost and time. Recent works try to explore more efficient alternatives by adjusting LVLMs' internal representations. Although promising, these methods may cause hallucinations to be insufficiently suppressed or lead to excessive interventions that negatively affect normal semantics. In this work, we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify semantic directions closely associated with faithfulness or hallucination, extracting more precise and disentangled hallucination-related representations. Our analysis demonstrates that interventions along the identified faithful direction can mitigate hallucinations, while those along the hallucinatory direction can exacerbate them. Building on these insights, we propose Steering LVLMs via SAE Latent Directions (SSL), a plug-and-play method based on SAE-derived latent directions to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSL significantly outperforms existing decoding approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining transferability across different model architectures with negligible additional time overhead.

  This report outlines our approach using vision language model systems for the Driving with Language track of the CVPR 2024 Autonomous Grand Challenge. We have exclusively utilized the DriveLM-nuScenes dataset for training our models. Our systems are built on the LLaVA models, which we enhanced through fine-tuning with the LoRA and DoRA methods. Additionally, we have integrated depth information from open-source depth estimation models to enrich the training and inference processes. For inference, particularly with multiple-choice and yes/no questions, we adopted a Chain-of-Thought reasoning approach to improve the accuracy of the results. This comprehensive methodology enabled us to achieve a top score of 0.7799 on the validation set leaderboard, ranking 1st on the leaderboard.

- **[SpecVLM: Fast Speculative Decoding in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11815)**  `arXiv:2509.11815`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Haiduo Huang, Fuwei Yang, Zhenhua Liu, Xuanwu Yin, Dong Li, Pengju Ren, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative decoding is a powerful way to accelerate autoregressive large language models (LLMs), but directly porting it to vision-language models (VLMs) faces unique systems constraints: the prefill stage is dominated by visual tokens whose count scales with image resolution and video length, inflating both compute and memory, especially the key-value (KV) cache. We study speculative decoding for VLMs and introduce SpecVLM, a practical system that (1) establishes a strong EAGLE-2-style baseline, EagleVLM, delivering 1.5--2.3x end-to-end speedups over full autoregressive inference, and (2) further accelerates VLM inference with an elastic visual compressor that adaptively selects among pruning, pooling, convolution, and resampler primitives to balance FLOPs/parameters and accuracy per input. To avoid costly offline distillation corpora, we propose an online-logit distillation protocol that trains the draft model with on-the-fly teacher logits and penultimate features using a combined cross-entropy and Smooth L1 objective, eliminating storage and preprocessing while remaining compute-efficient. This protocol reveals a training-time scaling effect: longer online training monotonically increases the draft model's average accepted length, improving speculative efficiency. Empirically, SpecVLM achieves additional acceleration, culminating in 2.5--2.9x end-to-end speedups within 5 epochs across LLaVA and MMMU, consistently over resolutions and task difficulties, while preserving the target model's output distribution (lossless decoding).

- **[Towards Understanding Visual Grounding in Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10345)**  `arXiv:2509.10345`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Georgios Pantazopoulos, Eda B. √ñzyiƒüit_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual grounding refers to the ability of a model to identify a region within some visual input that matches a textual description. Consequently, a model equipped with visual grounding capabilities can target a wide range of applications in various domains, including referring expression comprehension, answering questions pertinent to fine-grained details in images or videos, caption visual context by explicitly referring to entities, as well as low and high-level control in simulated and real environments. In this survey paper, we review representative works across the key areas of research on modern general-purpose vision language models (VLMs). We first outline the importance of grounding in VLMs, then delineate the core components of the contemporary paradigm for developing grounded models, and examine their practical applications, including benchmarks and evaluation metrics for grounded multimodal generation. We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among visual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally, we analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising directions for future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal vision-language tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to visual adversarial attacks, which can substantially compromise their performance. In this paper, we introduce F3, a novel adversarial purification framework that employs a counterintuitive ``fighting fire with fire'' strategy: intentionally introducing simple perturbations to adversarial examples to mitigate their harmful effects. Specifically, F3 leverages cross-modal attentions derived from randomly perturbed adversary examples as reference targets. By injecting noise into these adversarial examples, F3 effectively refines their attention, resulting in cleaner and more reliable model outputs. Remarkably, this seemingly paradoxical approach of employing noise to counteract adversarial attacks yields impressive purification results. Furthermore, F3 offers several distinct advantages: it is training-free and straightforward to implement, and exhibits significant computational efficiency improvements compared to existing purification methods. These attributes render F3 particularly suitable for large-scale industrial applications where both robust performance and operational efficiency are critical priorities.

  For individuals with blindness or low vision (BLV), navigating complex environments can pose serious risks. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for generating scene descriptions, but their effectiveness for BLV users remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a user study with eight BLV participants to systematically evaluate preferences for six types of LVLM descriptions. While they helped to reduce fear and improve actionability, user ratings showed wide variation in sufficiency and conciseness. Furthermore, GPT-4o--despite its strong potential to refine descriptions--was not consistently preferred by participants. We use the insights obtained from the user study to build training data for building our new automatic evaluation metric that can capture BLV preferences effectively. Our findings underscore the urgent need for BLV-centered evaluation metrics and human-in-the-loop feedback to advance LVLM description quality for accessibility.

  Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in language-guided perceptual tasks such as recognition, segmentation, and object detection. However, their effectiveness in addressing visual cognition problems that require high-level multi-image reasoning and visual working memory is not well-established. One such challenge is matrix reasoning - the cognitive ability to discern relationships among patterns in a set of images and extrapolate to predict subsequent patterns. This skill is crucial during the early neurodevelopmental stages of children. Inspired by the matrix reasoning tasks in Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), we propose a new dataset MaRs-VQA to evaluate the visual cognition capability of MLLMs and compare their performance with existing human visual cognition studies. Based on the training data of MaRs-VQA, we also finetune a baseline model Qwen2-VCog with multi-stage cognition reasoning annotations. Our comparative experiments with different baselines reveal a gap between MLLMs and human intelligence, highlighting the visual cognitive limitations of current MLLMs. We believe that the public release of MaRs-VQA and the Qwen2-VCog baseline model will drive progress toward the next generation of MLLMs with human-like visual cognition abilities. MaRs-VQA is available atthis http URL. The training code of Qwen2-VCog is available atthis http URL.

  We introduce Hierarchical Streaming Video Understanding, a task that combines online temporal action localization with free-form description generation. Given the scarcity of datasets with hierarchical and fine-grained temporal annotations, we demonstrate that LLMs can effectively group atomic actions into higher-level events, enriching existing datasets. We then propose OpenHOUSE (Open-ended Hierarchical Online Understanding System for Events), which extends streaming action perception beyond action classification. OpenHOUSE features a specialized streaming module that accurately detects boundaries between closely adjacent actions, nearly doubling the performance of direct extensions of existing methods. We envision the future of streaming action perception in the integration of powerful generative models, with OpenHOUSE representing a key step in that direction.

  Generative vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong high-level image understanding but lack spatially dense alignment between vision and language modalities, as our findings indicate. Orthogonal to advancements in generative VLMs, another line of research has focused on representation learning for vision-language alignment, targeting zero-shot inference for dense tasks like segmentation. In this work, we bridge these two directions by densely aligning images with synthetic descriptions generated by VLMs. Synthetic captions are inexpensive, scalable, and easy to generate, making them an excellent source of high-level semantic understanding for dense alignment methods. Empirically, our approach outperforms prior work on standard zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks/datasets, while also being more data-efficient.

  With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Sora, video quality assessment (VQA) is becoming increasingly crucial for selecting high-quality videos from large-scale datasets used in pre-training. Traditional VQA methods, typically producing single numerical scores, often lack comprehensiveness and interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce MVQA-68K, a novel multi-dimensional VQA dataset comprising over 68,000 carefully annotated videos, covering seven essential quality dimensions: overall aesthetics, camera movement, dynamic degree, texture detail, composition, visual quality, and factual consistency. Each annotation includes detailed chain-of-thought reasoning to facilitate interpretability and comprehensive understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVQA-68K significantly enhances the performance of various multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on the VQA task, achieving state-of-the-art results not only on our internal test set (Fig.1) but also on public benchmarks including LSVQ-test, LSVQ-1080p, and LIVE-VQC. Meantime, incorporating explicit reasoning process during VQA training substantially boosts the zero-shot generalization. Code and dataset will be available at github:this https URL

  Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding is a fundamental task for building GUI agents. However, general vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with this task due to a lack of specific optimization. We identify a key gap in this paper: while VLMs exhibit significant latent grounding potential, as demonstrated by their performance measured by Pointing Game, they underperform when tasked with outputting explicit coordinates. To address this discrepancy, and bypass the high data and annotation costs of current fine-tuning approaches, we propose three zero-shot auxiliary reasoning methods. By providing explicit spatial cues such as axes, grids and labeled intersections as part of the input image, these methods enable VLMs to articulate their implicit spatial understanding capabilities. We evaluate these methods on four GUI grounding benchmarks across seven open-source and proprietary VLMs. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed methods substantially improve the performance of GUI grounding.

  As intelligent transportation systems advance, traffic video understanding plays an increasingly pivotal role in comprehensive scene perception and causal analysis. Yet, existing approaches face notable challenges in accurately modeling spatiotemporal causality and integrating domain-specific knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Traffic-MLLM, a multimodal large language model tailored for fine-grained traffic analysis. Built on the Qwen2.5-VL backbone, our model leverages high-quality traffic-specific multimodal datasets and uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for lightweight fine-tuning, significantly enhancing its capacity to model continuous spatiotemporal features in video sequences. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative knowledge prompting module fusing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling precise injection of detailed traffic regulations and domain knowledge into the inference process. This design markedly boosts the model's logical reasoning and knowledge adaptation capabilities. Experimental results on TrafficQA and DriveQA benchmarks show Traffic-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its superior ability to process multimodal traffic data. It also exhibits remarkable zero-shot reasoning and cross-scenario generalization capabilities.

  Our objective is the automatic generation of Audio Descriptions (ADs) for edited video material, such as movies and TV series. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage framework that leverages "shots" as the fundamental units of video understanding. This includes extending temporal context to neighbouring shots and incorporating film grammar devices, such as shot scales and thread structures, to guide AD generation. Our method is compatible with both open-source and proprietary Visual-Language Models (VLMs), integrating expert knowledge from add-on modules without requiring additional training of the VLMs. We achieve state-of-the-art performance among all prior training-free approaches and even surpass fine-tuned methods on several benchmarks. To evaluate the quality of predicted ADs, we introduce a new evaluation measure -- an action score -- specifically targeted to assessing this important aspect of AD. Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation protocol that treats automatic frameworks as AD generation assistants and asks them to generate multiple candidate ADs for selection.

  The interpretation of multi-temporal remote sensing imagery is critical for monitoring Earth's dynamic processes-yet previous change detection methods, which produce binary or semantic masks, fall short of providing human-readable insights into changes. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have opened a new frontier by fusing visual and linguistic modalities, enabling spatio-temporal vision-language understanding: models that not only capture spatial and temporal dependencies to recognize changes but also provide a richer interactive semantic analysis of temporal images (e.g., generate descriptive captions and answer natural-language queries). In this survey, we present the first comprehensive review of RS-STVLMs. The survey covers the evolution of models from early task-specific models to recent general foundation models that leverage powerful large language models. We discuss progress in representative tasks, such as change captioning, change question answering, and change grounding. Moreover, we systematically dissect the fundamental components and key technologies underlying these models, and review the datasets and evaluation metrics that have driven the field. By synthesizing task-level insights with a deep dive into shared architectural patterns, we aim to illuminate current achievements and chart promising directions for future research in spatio-temporal vision-language understanding for remote sensing.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image classification by leveraging predefined sets of labels to construct text prompts for zero-shot reasoning. However, these approaches face significant limitations in undefined domains, where the label space is vocabulary-unknown and composite. We thus introduce Generative Semantic Labels (GSLs), a novel task that aims to predict a comprehensive set of semantic labels for an image without being constrained by a predefined labels set. Unlike traditional zero-shot classification, GSLs generates multiple semantic-level labels, encompassing objects, scenes, attributes, and relationships, thereby providing a richer and more accurate representation of image content. In this paper, we propose Chain-of-Action (CoA), an innovative method designed to tackle the GSLs task. CoA is motivated by the observation that enriched contextual information significantly improves generative performance during inference. Specifically, CoA decomposes the GSLs task into a sequence of detailed actions. Each action extracts and merges key information from the previous step, passing enriched context to the next, ultimately guiding the VLM to generate comprehensive and accurate semantic labels. We evaluate the effectiveness of CoA through extensive experiments on widely-used benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate significant improvements across key performance metrics, validating the capability of CoA to generate accurate and contextually rich semantic labels. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in generative semantic labels but also opens new avenues for applying VLMs in open-ended and dynamic real-world scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce CEMTM, a context-enhanced multimodal topic model designed to infer coherent and interpretable topic structures from both short and long documents containing text and images. CEMTM builds on fine-tuned large vision language models (LVLMs) to obtain contextualized embeddings, and employs a distributional attention mechanism to weight token-level contributions to topic inference. A reconstruction objective aligns topic-based representations with the document embedding, encouraging semantic consistency across modalities. Unlike existing approaches, CEMTM can process multiple images per document without repeated encoding and maintains interpretability through explicit word-topic and document-topic distributions. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarks show that CEMTM consistently outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines, achieving a remarkable average LLM score of 2.61. Further analysis shows its effectiveness in downstream few-shot retrieval and its ability to capture visually grounded semantics in complex domains such as scientific articles.

  Multimodal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to predict missing links in multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) by leveraging information from various modalities alongside structural data. Existing MMKGC approaches primarily extend traditional knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models, which often require creating an embedding for every entity. This results in large model sizes and inefficiencies in integrating multimodal information, particularly for real-world graphs. Meanwhile, Transformer-based models have demonstrated competitive performance in knowledge graph completion (KGC). However, their focus on single-modal knowledge limits their capacity to utilize cross-modal information. Recently, Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in cross-modal tasks but are constrained by the high cost of training. In this work, we propose a novel approach that integrates Transformer-based KGE models with cross-modal context generated by pre-trained VLMs, thereby extending their applicability to MMKGC. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained VLM to transform relevant visual information from entities and their neighbors into textual sequences. We then frame KGC as a sequence-to-sequence task, fine-tuning the model with the generated cross-modal context. This simple yet effective method significantly reduces model size compared to traditional KGE approaches while achieving competitive performance across multiple large-scale datasets with minimal hyperparameter tuning.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable powerful multimodal reasoning but suffer from slow autoregressive inference, limiting their deployment in real-time applications. We introduce Spec-LLaVA, a system that applies speculative decoding to accelerate VLMs without sacrificing output quality. Spec-LLaVA pairs a lightweight draft VLM with a large target model: the draft speculates future tokens, which the target verifies in parallel, allowing multiple tokens to be generated per step. To maximize efficiency, we design a dynamic tree-based verification algorithm that adaptively expands and prunes speculative branches using draft model confidence. On MS COCO out-of-domain images, Spec-LLaVA achieves up to 3.28$\times$ faster decoding on LLaVA-1.5 (7B, 13B) with no loss in generation quality. This work presents a lossless acceleration framework for VLMs using dynamic tree-structured speculative decoding, opening a path toward practical real-time multimodal assistants. Importantly, the lightweight draft model design makes the framework amenable to resource-constrained or on-device deployment settings.

  During spontaneous conversations, speakers collaborate on novel referring expressions, which they can then re-use in subsequent conversations. Understanding such referring expressions is an important ability for an embodied agent, so that it can carry out tasks in the real world. This requires integrating and understanding language, vision, and conversational interaction. We study the capabilities of seven state-of-the-art Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) as overhearers to a corpus of spontaneous conversations between pairs of human discourse participants engaged in a collaborative object-matching task. We find that such a task remains challenging for current LVLMs and they all fail to show a consistent performance improvement as they overhear more conversations from the same discourse participants repeating the same task for multiple rounds. We release our corpus and code for reproducibility and to facilitate future research.

  With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a variety of vision-language tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on objective visual question answering or captioning, inadequately assessing the models' ability to understand complex and subjective human emotions. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmoBench-Reddit, a novel, hierarchical benchmark for multimodal emotion understanding. The dataset comprises 350 meticulously curated samples from the social media platform Reddit, each containing an image, associated user-provided text, and an emotion category (sad, humor, sarcasm, happy) confirmed by user flairs. We designed a hierarchical task framework that progresses from basic perception to advanced cognition, with each data point featuring six multiple-choice questions and one open-ended question of increasing difficulty. Perception tasks evaluate the model's ability to identify basic visual elements (e.g., colors, objects), while cognition tasks require scene reasoning, intent understanding, and deep empathy integrating textual context. We ensured annotation quality through a combination of AI assistance (Claude 4) and manual verification.

  Text-to-image (T2I) models, while offering immense creative potential, are highly reliant on human intervention, posing significant usability challenges that often necessitate manual, iterative prompt engineering over often underspecified prompts. This paper introduces Maestro, a novel self-evolving image generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously self-improve generated images through iterative evolution of prompts, using only an initial prompt. Maestro incorporates two key innovations: 1) self-critique, where specialized multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents act as 'critics' to identify weaknesses in generated images, correct for under-specification, and provide interpretable edit signals, which are then integrated by a 'verifier' agent while preserving user intent; and 2) self-evolution, utilizing MLLM-as-a-judge for head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images, eschewing problematic images, and evolving creative prompt candidates that align with user intents. Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models demonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with more advanced MLLM components. This work presents a robust, interpretable, and effective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are susceptible to the implicit reasoning risk, wherein innocuous unimodal inputs synergistically assemble into risky multimodal data that produce harmful outputs. We attribute this vulnerability to the difficulty of MLLMs maintaining safety alignment through long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce Safe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI), the first dataset featuring interpretable reasoning paths tailored for such a cross-modal challenge. A novel training framework, Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO), is also designed based on the SSUI dataset to align the MLLM's internal reasoning process with human safety values. Experimental results show that our SRPO-trained models achieve state-of-the-art results on key safety benchmarks, including the proposed Reasoning Path Benchmark (RSBench), significantly outperforming both open-source and top-tier commercial MLLMs.

  Healthcare and medicine are multimodal disciplines that deal with multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. Although some multimodal reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed preliminary approach.

  This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) self-management. We constructed a database of approximately 3,000 anteroposterior X-rays with diagnostic texts and evaluated five MLLMs through a `Divide and Conquer' framework consisting of a visual question-answering task, a domain knowledge assessment task, and a patient education counseling assessment task. Our investigation revealed limitations of MLLMs' ability in interpreting complex spinal radiographs and comprehending AIS care knowledge. To address these, we pioneered enhancing MLLMs with spinal keypoint prompting and compiled an AIS knowledge base for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), respectively. Results showed varying effectiveness of visual prompting across different architectures, while RAG substantially improved models' performances on the knowledge assessment task. Our findings indicate current MLLMs are far from capable in realizing personalized assistant in AIS care. The greatest challenge lies in their abilities to obtain accurate detections of spinal deformity locations (best accuracy: 0.55) and directions (best accuracy: 0.13).

  Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps: they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1) Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025, spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2) Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3) Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30 state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress with multiple golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These results highlight the performance gap between open-source models and top students, the strong reasoning abilities of closed-source models, and the remaining room for improvement.
