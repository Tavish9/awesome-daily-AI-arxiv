  Exploration is essential for general-purpose robotic learning, especially in open-ended environments where dense rewards, explicit goals, or task-specific supervision are scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic reasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a compelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However, their outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute), an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration is often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to deepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes, predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop environments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful exploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the entropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports downstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the performance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations.

  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding, reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making. Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid but practicallythis http URLaddress these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks, including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile planning capabilities. Project page:this https URL

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically bridge the gap between perceptual and action spaces by pre-training a large-scale Vision-Language Model (VLM) on robotic data. While this approach greatly enhances performance, it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model.

- **[Kinetostatics and Particle-Swarm Optimization of Vehicle-Mounted Underactuated Metamorphic Loading Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09093)**  `arXiv:2509.09093`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fixed degree-of-freedom (DoF) loading mechanisms often suffer from excessive actuators, complex control, and limited adaptability to dynamic tasks. This study proposes an innovative mechanism of underactuated metamorphic loading manipulators (UMLM), integrating a metamorphic arm with a passively adaptive gripper. The metamorphic arm exploits geometric constraints, enabling the topology reconfiguration and flexible motion trajectories without additional actuators. The adaptive gripper, driven entirely by the arm, conforms to diverse objects through passive compliance. A structural model is developed, and a kinetostatics analysis is conducted to investigate isomorphic grasping configurations. To optimize performance, Particle-Swarm Optimization (PSO) is utilized to refine the gripper's dimensional parameters, ensuring robust adaptability across various applications. Simulation results validate the UMLM's easily implemented control strategy, operational versatility, and effectiveness in grasping diverse objects in dynamic environments. This work underscores the practical potential of underactuated metamorphic mechanisms in applications requiring efficient and adaptable loading solutions. Beyond the specific design, this generalized modeling and optimization framework extends to a broader class of manipulators, offering a scalable approach to the development of robotic systems that require efficiency, flexibility, and robust performance.

- **[Improving Alignment in LVLMs with Debiased Self-Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20655)**  `arXiv:2508.20655`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Sihan Yang, Chenhang Cui, Zihao Zhao, Yiyang Zhou, Weilong Yan, Ying Wei, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets, human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

- **[Focusing by Contrastive Attention: Enhancing VLMs' Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06461)**  `arXiv:2509.06461`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yuyao Ge, Shenghua Liu, Yiwei Wang, Lingrui Mei, Baolong Bi, Xuanshan Zhou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance, achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with contrasting attention.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce DEEVISum (Distilled Early Exit Vision language model for Summarization), a lightweight, efficient, and scalable vision language model designed for segment wise video summarization. Leveraging multi modal prompts that combine textual and audio derived signals, DEEVISum incorporates Multi Stage Knowledge Distillation (MSKD) and Early Exit (EE) to strike a balance between performance and efficiency. MSKD offers a 1.33% absolute F1 improvement over baseline distillation (0.5%), while EE reduces inference time by approximately 21% with a 1.3 point drop in F1. Evaluated on the TVSum dataset, our best model PaLI Gemma2 3B + MSKD achieves an F1 score of 61.1, competing the performance of significantly larger models, all while maintaining a lower computational footprint. We publicly release our code and processed dataset to support further research.

- **[IDEATOR: Jailbreaking and Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models Using Themselves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00827)**  `arXiv:2411.00827`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Ruofan Wang, Juncheng Li, Yixu Wang, Bo Wang, Xiaosen Wang, Yan Teng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for strongerthis http URLis publicly available atthis https URL.

  Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above" option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection, HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and dataset are released publicly and can be accessed atthis https URL.

- **[Kling-Avatar: Grounding Multimodal Instructions for Cascaded Long-Duration Avatar Animation Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09595)**  `arXiv:2509.09595`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yikang Ding, Jiwen Liu, Wenyuan Zhang, Zekun Wang, Wentao Hu, Liyuan Cui, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues, without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid, fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar synthesis.

- **[Decoupling Clinical and Class-Agnostic Features for Reliable Few-Shot Adaptation under Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09397)**  `arXiv:2509.09397`  `cs.CV`  
  _Umaima Rahman, Raza Imam, Mohammad Yaqub, Dwarikanath Mahapatra_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports, limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is available at:this https URL.

- **[Visual Programmability: A Guide for Code-as-Thought in Chart Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09286)**  `arXiv:2509.09286`  `cs.CV`  
  _Bohao Tang, Yan Ma, Fei Zhang, Jiadi Su, Ethan Chern, Zhulin Hu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each task.

- **[DATE: Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09263)**  `arXiv:2509.09263`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chao Yuan, Yang Yang, Yehui Yang, Zach Cheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order. However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy. Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t. absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some benchmarks.

  With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image synthesis has posed new challenges to digital security and media credibility. Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated images. The benchmarking results reveal the limitations of current AI detection methods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on human adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images, and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score. Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

  Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated content. Med3DInsight introduces a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks, potentially enhancing their performance. Our source code, generated datasets, and pre-trained models will be available atthis https URL.

- **[Discovering Divergent Representations between Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08940)**  `arXiv:2509.08940`  `cs.CV`  
  _Lisa Dunlap, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Trevor Darrell, Fabian Caba Heilbron, Josef Sivic, Bryan Russell_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon (Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models, finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American people in media professions.

- **[Can Vision-Language Models Solve Visual Math Equations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09013)**  `arXiv:2509.09013`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  Despite strong performance in visual understanding and language-based reasoning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with tasks requiring integrated perception and symbolic computation. We study this limitation through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors, highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor. These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning.

  Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents. Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in robotics.
