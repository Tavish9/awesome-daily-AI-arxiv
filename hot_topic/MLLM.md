  Ensuring robust planning and decision-making under rare, diverse, and visually degraded long-tail scenarios remains a fundamental challenge for autonomous driving in urban environments. This issue becomes more critical in cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and reason across complex environments. To address this challenge, we propose V2X-REALM, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework with adaptive multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail scenarios. V2X-REALM introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2X-REALM significantly outperforms existing baselines in robustness, semantic reasoning, safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions, advancing the scalability of end-to-end cooperative autonomous driving.

  Vision-language-action (VLA) models extend vision-language models (VLM) by integrating action generation modules for robotic manipulation. Leveraging strengths of VLM in vision perception and instruction understanding, VLA models exhibit promising generalization across diverse manipulation tasks. However, applications demanding high precision and accuracy reveal performance gaps without further adaptation. Evidence from multiple domains highlights the critical role of post-training to align foundational models with downstream applications, spurring extensive research on post-training VLA models. VLA model post-training aims to address the challenge of improving an embodiment's ability to interact with the environment for the given tasks, analogous to the process of humans motor skills acquisition. Accordingly, this paper reviews post-training strategies for VLA models through the lens of human motor learning, focusing on three dimensions: environments, embodiments, and tasks. A structured taxonomy is introduced aligned with human learning mechanisms: (1) enhancing environmental perception, (2) improving embodiment awareness, (3) deepening task comprehension, and (4) multi-component integration. Finally, key challenges and trends in post-training VLA models are identified, establishing a conceptual framework to guide future research. This work delivers both a comprehensive overview of current VLA model post-training methods from a human motor learning perspective and practical insights for VLA model development.

- **[Personalized Federated Learning via Dual-Prompt Optimization and Cross Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21144)**  `arXiv:2506.21144`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`

  Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC. Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained, inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO) approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization, followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

  Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias, i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks from context.

- **[Task-Aware KV Compression For Cost-Effective Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21184)**  `arXiv:2506.21184`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs: low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage, Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness. Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while substantially saving the computation cost.

- **[Multimodal Prompt Alignment for Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21017)**  `arXiv:2506.21017`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Fuyan Ma, Yiran He, Bin Sun, Shutao Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success, current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained model and minimizing computational costs.

  Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse, pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded, humanly-interpretable summary reports.

- **[Leveraging Vision-Language Models to Select Trustworthy Super-Resolution Samples Generated by Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20832)**  `arXiv:2506.20832`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Cansu Korkmaz, Ahmet Murat Tekalp, Zafer Dogan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components: semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition. We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable, and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness, this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

  Recent advancements in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable reasoning capabilities and proficiency in generalization. However, processing a large number of visual tokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational overhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression method aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context generation. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation window for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache, focusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced multi-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of token importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to uniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the full cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing decoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of inputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits increasing performance advantages over existing approaches.

  Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve the generalization capabilities. VLMs, typically pre-trained on vision-language understanding tasks, provide rich semantic knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, prior research has shown that VLMs often focus on high-level semantic content and neglect low-level features, limiting their ability to capture detailed spatial information and understand physical dynamics. These aspects, which are crucial for embodied control tasks, remain underexplored in existing pre-training paradigms. In this paper, we investigate the training paradigm for VLAs, and introduce \textbf{UP-VLA}, a \textbf{U}nified VLA model training with both multi-modal \textbf{U}nderstanding and future \textbf{P}rediction objectives, enhancing both high-level semantic comprehension and low-level spatial understanding. Experimental results show that UP-VLA achieves a 33% improvement on the Calvin ABC-D benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Additionally, UP-VLA demonstrates improved success rates in real-world manipulation tasks, particularly those requiring precise spatial information.

  Meteorological heatmaps play a vital role in deciphering extreme weather phenomena, yet their inherent complexities marked by irregular contours, unstructured patterns, and complex color variations present unique analytical hurdles for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o, Qwen-VL, and LLaVA 1.6 struggle with tasks such as precise color identification and spatial localization, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete interpretations. To address these challenges, we introduce Sparse Position and Outline Tracking (SPOT), a novel algorithm specifically designed to process irregularly shaped colored regions in visual data. SPOT identifies and localizes these regions by extracting their spatial coordinates, enabling structured representations of irregular shapes. Building on SPOT, we construct ClimateIQA, a novel meteorological visual question answering (VQA) dataset, comprising 26,280 high-resolution heatmaps and 762,120 instruction samples for wind gust, total precipitation, wind chill index and heat index analysis. ClimateIQA enhances VLM training by incorporating spatial cues, geographic metadata, and reanalysis data, improving model accuracy in interpreting and describing extreme weather features. Furthermore, we develop Climate-Zoo, a suite of fine-tuned VLMs based on SPOT-empowered ClimateIQA, which significantly outperforms existing models in meteorological heatmap tasks.

- **[Mitigating Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Dynamic Logits Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21509)**  `arXiv:2506.21509`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes, and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations, thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be released on Github.

  Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding, their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation. This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce \textbf{ShotBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed (predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60\% average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct \textbf{ShotQA}, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop \textbf{ShotVL} through supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on ShotBench, establishing new \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance. We open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.

  Current vision-language models (VLMs) are well-adapted for general visual understanding tasks. However, they perform inadequately when handling complex visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex reasoning. We establish an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding Benchmark (E-HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and evaluate our resulting LLaVA-Pose model on the benchmark, achieving significant improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 33.2% compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the effectiveness of keypoint-integrated data in enhancing multimodal models for human-centric visual understanding. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual grounding in text-rich document images is a critical yet underexplored challenge for document intelligence and visual question answering (VQA) systems. We present \drishtikon, a multi-granular visual grounding framework designed to enhance interpretability and trust in VQA for complex, multilingual documents. Our approach integrates robust multi-lingual OCR, large language models, and a novel region matching algorithm to accurately localize answer spans at block, line, word, and point levels. We curate a new benchmark from the CircularsVQA test set, providing fine-grained, human-verified annotations across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level granularity offering the best trade-off between precision and recall. Ablation studies further highlight the benefits of multi-block and multi-line reasoning. Comparative evaluations with leading vision-language models reveal the limitations of current VLMs in precise localization, underscoring the effectiveness of our structured, alignment-based approach. Our findings pave the way for more robust and interpretable document understanding systems in real-world, text-centric scenarios. Code and dataset has been made available atthis https URL.

- **[OracleFusion: Assisting the Decipherment of Oracle Bone Script with Structurally Constrained Semantic Typography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21101)**  `arXiv:2506.21101`  `cs.CV`  
  _Caoshuo Li, Zengmao Ding, Xiaobin Hu, Bang Li, Donghao Luo, AndyPian Wu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient civilizations. Despite the discovery of approximately 4,500 OBS characters, only about 1,600 have been deciphered. The remaining undeciphered ones, with their complex structure and abstract imagery, pose significant challenges for interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel two-stage semantic typography framework, named OracleFusion. In the first stage, this approach leverages the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with enhanced Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze the glyph structure of the OBS character and perform visual localization of key components. In the second stage, we introduce Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF), incorporating glyph structure constraints and glyph maintenance constraints to ensure the accurate generation of semantically enriched vector fonts. This approach preserves the objective integrity of the glyph structure, offering visually enhanced representations that assist experts in deciphering OBS. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that OracleFusion outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, significantly enhancing both readability and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, OracleFusion provides expert-like insights on unseen oracle characters, making it a valuable tool for advancing the decipherment of OBS.

- **[TSDASeg: A Two-Stage Model with Direct Alignment for Interactive Point Cloud Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20991)**  `arXiv:2506.20991`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chade Li, Pengju Zhang, Yihong Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence. However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3) Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at github.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a 60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have witnessed a surge in the development of advanced reasoning paradigms, which are now being integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and \textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

  Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance. Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations (perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements). We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains, and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of unobservable space.

  Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur, skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula) and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML, Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of 1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA, WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table understanding.

  The real value of knowledge lies not just in its accumulation, but in its potential to be harnessed effectively to conquer the unknown. Although recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit impressing multimodal capabilities, they often fail in rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due to limited relevant knowledge. To explore this, we adopt visual game cognition as a testbed and select Monster Hunter: World as the target to construct a multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG), which incorporates multi-modalities and intricate entity relations. We also design a series of challenging queries based on MH-MMKG to evaluate the models' ability for complex knowledge retrieval and reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent retriever that enables a model to autonomously search relevant knowledge without additional training. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances the performance of MLLMs, providing a new perspective on multimodal knowledge-augmented reasoning and laying a solid foundation for future research.
