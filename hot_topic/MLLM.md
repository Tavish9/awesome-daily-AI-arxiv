  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise for autonomous driving, yet their struggle with hallucinations, inefficient reasoning, and limited real-world validation hinders accurate perception and robust step-by-step reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce \textbf{AgentThink}, a pioneering unified framework that, for the first time, integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with dynamic, agent-style tool invocation for autonomous driving tasks. AgentThink's core innovations include: \textbf{(i) Structured Data Generation}, by establishing an autonomous driving tool library to automatically construct structured, self-verified reasoning data explicitly incorporating tool usage for diverse driving scenarios; \textbf{(ii) A Two-stage Training Pipeline}, employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to equip VLMs with the capability for autonomous tool invocation; and \textbf{(iii) Agent-style Tool-Usage Evaluation}, introducing a novel multi-tool assessment protocol to rigorously evaluate the model's tool invocation and utilization. Experiments on the DriveLMM-o1 benchmark demonstrate AgentThink significantly boosts overall reasoning scores by \textbf{53.91\%} and enhances answer accuracy by \textbf{33.54\%}, while markedly improving reasoning quality and consistency. Furthermore, ablation studies and robust zero-shot/few-shot generalization experiments across various benchmarks underscore its powerful capabilities. These findings highlight a promising trajectory for developing trustworthy and tool-aware autonomous driving models.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) acquire real-world knowledge and general reasoning ability through Internet-scale image-text corpora. They can augment robotic systems with scene understanding and task planning, and assist visuomotor policies that are trained on robot trajectory data. We explore the reverse paradigm - using rich, real, multi-modal robot trajectory data to enhance and evaluate VLMs. In this paper, we present Robo2VLM, a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset generation framework for VLMs. Given a human tele-operated robot trajectory, Robo2VLM derives ground-truth from non-visual and non-descriptive sensory modalities, such as end-effector pose, gripper aperture, and force sensing. Based on these modalities, it segments the robot trajectory into a sequence of manipulation phases. At each phase, Robo2VLM uses scene and interaction understanding to identify 3D properties of the robot, task goal, and the target object. The properties are used to generate representative VQA queries - images with textural multiple-choice questions - based on spatial, goal-conditioned, and interaction reasoning question templates. We curate Robo2VLM-1, a large-scale in-the-wild dataset with 684,710 questions covering 463 distinct scenes and 3,396 robotic manipulation tasks from 176k real robot trajectories. Results suggest that Robo2VLM-1 can benchmark and improve VLM capabilities in spatial and interaction reasoning.

  Foundation models (FMs) are increasingly used to bridge language and action in embodied agents, yet the operational characteristics of different FM integration strategies remain under-explored -- particularly for complex instruction following and versatile action generation in changing environments. This paper examines three paradigms for building robotic systems: end-to-end vision-language-action (VLA) models that implicitly integrate perception and planning, and modular pipelines incorporating either vision-language models (VLMs) or multimodal large language models (LLMs). We evaluate these paradigms through two focused case studies: a complex instruction grounding task assessing fine-grained instruction understanding and cross-modal disambiguation, and an object manipulation task targeting skill transfer via VLA finetuning. Our experiments in zero-shot and few-shot settings reveal trade-offs in generalization and data efficiency. By exploring performance limits, we distill design implications for developing language-driven physical agents and outline emerging challenges and opportunities for FM-powered robotics in real-world conditions.

  Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled autonomous agents to interact with computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), where accurately localizing the coordinates of interface elements (e.g., buttons) is often required for fine-grained actions. However, this remains significantly challenging, leading prior works to rely on large-scale web datasets to improve the grounding accuracy. In this work, we propose Reasoning Graphical User Interface Grounding for Data Efficiency (ReGUIDE), a novel and effective framework for web grounding that enables MLLMs to learn data efficiently through self-generated reasoning and spatial-aware criticism. More specifically, ReGUIDE learns to (i) self-generate a language reasoning process for the localization via online reinforcement learning, and (ii) criticize the prediction using spatial priors that enforce equivariance under input transformations. At inference time, ReGUIDE further boosts performance through a test-time scaling strategy, which combines spatial search with coordinate aggregation. Our experiments demonstrate that ReGUIDE significantly advances web grounding performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming baselines with substantially fewer training data points (e.g., only 0.2% samples compared to the best open-sourced baselines).

  State-of-the-art (SOTA) reinforcement learning (RL) methods have enabled vision-language model (VLM) agents to learn from interaction with online environments without human supervision. However, these methods often struggle with learning inefficiencies when applied to complex, real-world decision-making tasks with sparse rewards and long-horizon dependencies. We propose a novel framework, Variational Subgoal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (VSC-RL), advancing the VLM agents in resolving challenging decision-making tasks. Fundamentally distinct from existing methods, VSC-RL reformulates the decision-making problem as a variational subgoal-conditioned RL problem with the newly derived optimization objective, Subgoal Evidence Lower BOund (SGC-ELBO), which comprises two key components: (a) maximizing the subgoal-conditioned return, and (b) minimizing the divergence from a reference goal-conditioned policy. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that the VSC-RL can efficiently improve the learning efficiency without compromising performance guarantees. Across a diverse set of challenging benchmarks, including mobile device and web control tasks, VSC-RL consistently outperforms existing SOTA methods, achieving superior learning efficiency and performance.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown remarkable performance in cross-modal tasks through large-scale contrastive pre-training. To adapt these large transformer-based models efficiently for downstream tasks, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA have emerged as scalable alternatives to full fine-tuning, especially in few-shot scenarios. However, like traditional deep neural networks, VLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations can significantly degrade model performance. Adversarial training remains the most effective strategy for improving model robustness in PEFT. In this work, we propose AdvCLIP-LoRA, the first algorithm designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of CLIP models fine-tuned with LoRA in few-shot settings. Our method formulates adversarial fine-tuning as a minimax optimization problem and provides theoretical guarantees for convergence under smoothness and nonconvex-strong-concavity assumptions. Empirical results across eight datasets using ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32 models show that AdvCLIP-LoRA significantly improves robustness against common adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD), without sacrificing much clean accuracy. These findings highlight AdvCLIP-LoRA as a practical and theoretically grounded approach for robust adaptation of VLMs in resource-constrained settings.

  Ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning models in open-world deployment is a central challenge in AI safety. This thesis develops both algorithmic and theoretical foundations to address key reliability issues arising from distributional uncertainty and unknown classes, from standard neural networks to modern foundation models like large language models (LLMs).Traditional learning paradigms, such as empirical risk minimization (ERM), assume no distribution shift between training and inference, often leading to overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. This thesis introduces novel frameworks that jointly optimize for in-distribution accuracy and reliability to unseen data. A core contribution is the development of an unknown-aware learning framework that enables models to recognize and handle novel inputs without labeled OOD data.We propose new outlier synthesis methods, VOS, NPOS, and DREAM-OOD, to generate informative unknowns during training. Building on this, we present SAL, a theoretical and algorithmic framework that leverages unlabeled in-the-wild data to enhance OOD detection under realistic deployment conditions. These methods demonstrate that abundant unlabeled data can be harnessed to recognize and adapt to unforeseen inputs, providing formal reliability guarantees.The thesis also extends reliable learning to foundation models. We develop HaloScope for hallucination detection in LLMs, MLLMGuard for defending against malicious prompts in multimodal models, and data cleaning methods to denoise human feedback used for better alignment. These tools target failure modes that threaten the safety of large-scale models in deployment.Overall, these contributions promote unknown-aware learning as a new paradigm, and we hope it can advance the reliability of AI systems with minimal human efforts.

  Semi-supervised learning (SSL) alleviates the cost of data labeling process by exploiting unlabeled data, and has achieved promising results on various tasks such as image classification. Meanwhile, the Pretrain-Finetuning paradigm has garnered significant attention in recent years, and exploiting pre-trained models could also reduce the requirement of labeled data in downstream tasks. Therefore, a question naturally occurs: \emph{When the labeled data is scarce in the target tasks, should we exploit unlabeled data or pre-trained models?} To answer this question, we select pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as representative pretrain-finetuning instances and propose \textit{Few-shot SSL} -- a framework that enables fair comparison between these two paradigms by controlling the amount of labeled data used. Extensive experiments across various settings demonstrate that pre-trained VLMs generally outperform SSL methods in nearly all cases, except when the data has low resolution or lacks clear semantic structure. Therefore, we encourage future SSL research to compare with pre-trained models and explore deeper integration, such as using pre-trained knowledge to enhance pseudo-labeling. To support future research, we release our unified reproduction and evaluation framework. Codes are available \href{this https URL}{here}.

- **[Visual Perturbation and Adaptive Hard Negative Contrastive Learning for Compositional Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15576)**  `arXiv:2505.15576`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Xin Huang, Ruibin Li, Tong Jia, Wei Zheng, Ya Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are essential for multimodal tasks, especially compositional reasoning (CR) tasks, which require distinguishing fine-grained semantic differences between visual and textual embeddings. However, existing methods primarily fine-tune the model by generating text-based hard negative samples, neglecting the importance of image-based negative samples, which results in insufficient training of the visual encoder and ultimately impacts the overall performance of the model. Moreover, negative samples are typically treated uniformly, without considering their difficulty levels, and the alignment of positive samples is insufficient, which leads to challenges in aligning difficult sample pairs. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Hard Negative Perturbation Learning (AHNPL). AHNPL translates text-based hard negatives into the visual domain to generate semantically disturbed image-based negatives for training the model, thereby enhancing its overall performance. AHNPL also introduces a contrastive learning approach using a multimodal hard negative loss to improve the model's discrimination of hard negatives within each modality and a dynamic margin loss that adjusts the contrastive margin according to sample difficulty to enhance the distinction of challenging sample pairs. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method effectively boosts VLMs' performance on complex CR tasks. The source code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Prompt Tuning Vision Language Models with Margin Regularizer for Few-Shot Learning under Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15506)**  `arXiv:2505.15506`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, Vision-Language foundation models like CLIP and ALIGN, which are pre-trained on large-scale data have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization to diverse datasets with different classes and even domains. In this work, we take a step further and analyze whether these models can be adapted to target datasets having very different distributions and classes compared to what these models have been trained on, using only a few labeled examples from the target dataset. In such scenarios, finetuning large pretrained models is challenging due to problems of overfitting as well as loss of generalization, and has not been well explored in prior literature. Since, the pre-training data of such models are unavailable, it is difficult to comprehend the performance on various downstream datasets. First, we try to answer the question: Given a target dataset with a few labelled examples, can we estimate whether further fine-tuning can enhance the performance compared to zero-shot evaluation? by analyzing the common vision-language embedding space. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel prompt-tuning method, PromptMargin for adapting such large-scale VLMs directly on the few target samples. PromptMargin effectively tunes the text as well as visual prompts for this task, and has two main modules: 1) Firstly, we use a selective augmentation strategy to complement the few training samples in each task; 2) Additionally, to ensure robust training in the presence of unfamiliar class names, we increase the inter-class margin for improved class discrimination using a novel Multimodal Margin Regularizer. Extensive experiments and analysis across fifteen target benchmark datasets, with varying degrees of distribution shifts from natural images, shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework over the existing state-of-the-art approaches applied to this setting.this http URL.

- **[Visual Thoughts: A Unified Perspective of Understanding Multimodal Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15510)**  `arXiv:2505.15510`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant success in multimodal tasks, with multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) further enhancing performance and interpretability. Recent MCoT methods fall into two categories: (i) Textual-MCoT (T-MCoT), which takes multimodal input and produces textual output; and (ii) Interleaved-MCoT (I-MCoT), which generates interleaved image-text outputs. Despite advances in both approaches, the mechanisms driving these improvements are not fully understood. To fill this gap, we first reveal that MCoT boosts LVLMs by incorporating visual thoughts, which convey image information to the reasoning process regardless of the MCoT format, depending only on clarity and conciseness of expression. Furthermore, to explore visual thoughts systematically, we define four distinct forms of visual thought expressions and analyze them comprehensively. Our findings demonstrate that these forms differ in clarity and conciseness, yielding varying levels of MCoT improvement. Additionally, we explore the internal nature of visual thoughts, finding that visual thoughts serve as intermediaries between the input image and reasoning to deeper transformer layers, enabling more advanced visual information transmission. We hope that the visual thoughts can inspire further breakthroughs for future MCoT research.

  Reasoning about images with rich text, such as charts and documents, is a critical application of vision-language models (VLMs). However, VLMs often struggle in these domains due to the scarcity of diverse text-rich vision-language data. To address this challenge, we present CoSyn, a framework that leverages the coding capabilities of text-only large language models (LLMs) to automatically create synthetic text-rich multimodal data. Given input text describing a target domain (e.g., "nutrition fact labels"), CoSyn prompts an LLM to generate code (Python, HTML, LaTeX, etc.) for rendering synthetic images. With the underlying code as textual representations of the synthetic images, CoSyn can generate high-quality instruction-tuning data, again relying on a text-only LLM. Using CoSyn, we constructed a dataset comprising 400K images and 2.7M rows of vision-language instruction-tuning data. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data achieve state-of-the-art performance among competitive open-source models, including Llama 3.2, and surpass proprietary models such as GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5 Flash. Furthermore, CoSyn can produce synthetic pointing data, enabling VLMs to ground information within input images, showcasing its potential for developing multimodal agents capable of acting in real-world environments.

  The task of estimating the world model describing the dynamics of a real world process assumes immense importance for anticipating and preparing for future outcomes. For applications such as video surveillance, robotics applications, autonomous driving, etc. this objective entails synthesizing plausible visual futures, given a few frames of a video to set the visual context. Towards this end, we propose ProgGen, which undertakes the task of video frame prediction by representing the dynamics of the video using a set of neuro-symbolic, human-interpretable set of states (one per frame) by leveraging the inductive biases of Large (Vision) Language Models (LLM/VLM). In particular, ProgGen utilizes LLM/VLM to synthesize programs: (i) to estimate the states of the video, given the visual context (i.e. the frames); (ii) to predict the states corresponding to future time steps by estimating the transition dynamics; (iii) to render the predicted states as visual RGB-frames. Empirical evaluations reveal that our proposed method outperforms competing techniques at the task of video frame prediction in two challenging environments: (i) PhyWorld (ii) Cart Pole. Additionally, ProgGen permits counter-factual reasoning and interpretable video generation attesting to its effectiveness and generalizability for video generation tasks.

  The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has propelled their application in the medical field. However, Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) encounter factuality challenges due to modality misalignment, where the models prioritize textual knowledge over visual input, leading to hallucinations that contradict information in medical images. Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment in Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately mitigated clinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily distinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. To address this challenge, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference optimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference samples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference data by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations injected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate responses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising, disrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical relevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual tools, and integrate these scores into the preference optimization process as weights, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO significantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial improvements over existing preference optimization methods by averaging 14.2% and 51.7% across the Med-VQA and report generation tasks. Our code are available inthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding visual content, but their reliability in safety-critical contexts remains under-explored. We introduce VERI (Visual Emergency Recognition Dataset), a carefully designed diagnostic benchmark of 200 images (100 contrastive pairs). Each emergency scene is matched with a visually similar but safe counterpart through multi-stage human verification and iterative refinement. Using a two-stage protocol - risk identification and emergency response - we evaluate 14 VLMs (2B-124B parameters) across medical emergencies, accidents, and natural disasters. Our analysis reveals a systematic overreaction problem: models excel at identifying real emergencies (70-100 percent success rate) but suffer from an alarming rate of false alarms, misidentifying 31-96 percent of safe situations as dangerous, with 10 scenarios failed by all models regardless of scale. This "better-safe-than-sorry" bias manifests primarily through contextual overinterpretation (88-93 percent of errors), challenging VLMs' reliability for safety applications. These findings highlight persistent limitations that are not resolved by increasing model scale, motivating targeted approaches for improving contextual safety assessment in visually misleading scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of Vision Language Models (VLMs) has brought unprecedented advances in understanding multimodal information. The combination of textual and visual semantics in VLMs is highly complex and diverse, making the safety alignment of these models challenging. Furthermore, due to the limited study on the safety alignment of VLMs, there is a lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a Safety Preference Alignment dataset for Vision Language Models named SPA-VL. In terms of breadth, SPA-VL covers 6 harmfulness domains, 13 categories, and 53 subcategories, and contains 100,788 samples of the quadruple (question, image, chosen response, rejected response). In terms of depth, the responses are collected from 12 open-source (e.g., QwenVL) and closed-source (e.g., Gemini) VLMs to ensure diversity. The construction of preference data is fully automated, and the experimental results indicate that models trained with alignment techniques on the SPA-VL dataset exhibit substantial improvements in harmlessness and helpfulness while maintaining core capabilities. SPA-VL, as a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset, represents a significant milestone in ensuring that VLMs achieve both harmlessness and helpfulness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video understanding is inherently intention-driven-humans naturally focus on relevant frames based on their goals. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled flexible query-driven reasoning; however, video-based frameworks like Video Chain-of-Thought lack direct training signals to effectively identify relevant frames. Current approaches often rely on heuristic methods or pseudo-label supervised annotations, which are both costly and limited in scalability across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ViaRL, the first framework to leverage rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing frame selection in intention-driven video understanding. An iterated amplification strategy is adopted to perform alternating cyclic training in the video CoT system, where each component undergoes iterative cycles of refinement to improve its capabilities. ViaRL utilizes the answer accuracy of a downstream model as a reward signal to train a frame selector through trial-and-error, eliminating the need for expensive annotations while closely aligning with human-like learning processes. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, including VideoMME, LVBench, and MLVU, demonstrate that ViaRL consistently delivers superior temporal grounding performance and robust generalization across diverse video understanding tasks, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability. Notably, ViaRL achieves a nearly 15\% improvement on Needle QA, a subset of MLVU, which is required to search a specific needle within a long video and regarded as one of the most suitable benchmarks for evaluating temporal grounding.

  _Zhipei Xu, Xuanyu Zhang, Xing Zhou, Jian Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technologies, particularly in video generation, has led to unprecedented creative capabilities but also increased threats to information integrity, identity security, and public trust. Existing detection methods, while effective in general scenarios, lack robust solutions for human-centric videos, which pose greater risks due to their realism and potential for legal and ethical misuse. Moreover, current detection approaches often suffer from poor generalization, limited scalability, and reliance on labor-intensive supervised fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, the first interpretable MLLM-based framework for detecting human-centric fake videos, enhanced via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through our carefully designed accuracy detection reward and temporal compensation reward, it effectively avoids the use of high-cost text annotation data, enabling precise temporal modeling and forgery detection. Meanwhile, we design a dual-encoder architecture, combining high-level semantic reasoning and low-level artifact amplification to guide MLLMs in effective forgery detection. We further collect FakeHumanVid, a large-scale human-centric video benchmark that includes synthesis methods guided by pose, audio, and text inputs, enabling rigorous evaluation of detection methods in real-world scenes. Extensive experiments show that AvatarShield significantly outperforms existing approaches in both in-domain and cross-domain detection, setting a new standard for human-centric video forensics.

  Visual grounding (VG) is the capability to identify the specific regions in an image associated with a particular text description. In medical imaging, VG enhances interpretability by highlighting relevant pathological features corresponding to textual descriptions, improving model transparency and trustworthiness for wider adoption of deep learning models in clinical practice. Current models struggle to associate textual descriptions with disease regions due to inefficient attention mechanisms and a lack of fine-grained token representations. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate two key observations. First, current VLMs assign high norms to background tokens, diverting the model's attention from regions of disease. Second, the global tokens used for cross-modal learning are not representative of local disease tokens. This hampers identifying correlations between the text and disease tokens. To address this, we introduce simple, yet effective Disease-Aware Prompting (DAP) process, which uses the explainability map of a VLM to identify the appropriate image features. This simple strategy amplifies disease-relevant regions while suppressing background interference. Without any additional pixel-level annotations, DAP improves visual grounding accuracy by 20.74% compared to state-of-the-art methods across three major chest X-ray datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they lag significantly behind humans in spatial reasoning. We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual Reasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object transformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1 rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios. Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning.

  The intrication of brain signals drives research that leverages multimodal AI to align brain modalities with visual and textual data for explainable descriptions. However, most existing studies are limited to coarse interpretations, lacking essential details on object descriptions, locations, attributes, and their relationships. This leads to imprecise and ambiguous reconstructions when using such cues for visual decoding. To address this, we analyze different choices of vision feature spaces from pre-trained visual components within Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and introduce a zero-shot multimodal brain decoding method that interacts with these models to decode across multiple levels of granularities. % To assess a model's ability to decode fine details from brain signals, we propose the Multi-Granularity Brain Detail Understanding Benchmark (MG-BrainDub). This benchmark includes two key tasks: detailed descriptions and salient question-answering, with metrics highlighting key visual elements like objects, attributes, and relationships. Our approach enhances neural decoding precision and supports more accurate neuro-decoding applications. Code will be available atthis https URL.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant advances in integrating visual and linguistic information, yet their ability to reason about complex and real-world scenarios remains limited. The existing benchmarks are usually constructed in the task-oriented manner without guarantee that different task samples come from the same data distribution, thus they often fall short in evaluating the synergistic effects of lower-level perceptual capabilities on higher-order reasoning. To lift this limitation, we contribute Lens, a multi-level benchmark with 3.4K contemporary images and 60K+ human-authored questions covering eight tasks and 12 daily scenarios, forming three progressive task tiers, i.e., perception, understanding, and reasoning. One feature is that each image is equipped with rich annotations for all tasks. Thus, this dataset intrinsically supports to evaluate MLLMs to handle image-invariable prompts, from basic perception to compositional reasoning. In addition, our images are manully collected from the social media, in which 53% were published later than Jan. 2025. We evaluate 15+ frontier MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B, InternVL3-78B, GPT-4o and two reasoning models QVQ-72B-preview and Kimi-VL. These models are released later than Dec. 2024, and none of them achieve an accuracy greater than 60% in the reasoning tasks. Project page:this https URL. ICCV 2025 workshop page:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Language Models (VLMs) employed for visual question-answering (VQA) in autonomous driving often require substantial computational resources that pose a challenge for their deployment in resource-constrained vehicles. To address this challenge, we introduce TinyDrive, a lightweight yet effective VLM for multi-view VQA in driving scenarios. Our model comprises two key components including a multiscale vision encoder and a dual-level prioritization mechanism for tokens and sequences. The multiscale encoder facilitates the processing of multi-view images at diverse resolutions through scale injection and cross-scale gating to generate enhanced visual representations. At the token level, we design a token routing mechanism that dynamically selects and process the most informative tokens based on learned importance scores. At the sequence level, we propose integrating normalized loss, uncertainty estimates, and a diversity metric to formulate sequence scores that rank and preserve samples within a sequence priority buffer. Samples with higher scores are more frequently selected for training. TinyDrive is first evaluated on our custom-curated VQA dataset, and it is subsequently tested on the public DriveLM benchmark, where it achieves state-of-the-art language understanding performance. Notably, it achieves relative improvements of 11.1% and 35.4% in BLEU-4 and METEOR scores, respectively, despite having a significantly smaller parameter count.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse video understanding applications. Designing VLMs for video inputs requires effectively modeling the temporal dimension (i.e. capturing dependencies across frames) and balancing the processing of short and long videos. Specifically, short videos demand preservation of fine-grained details, whereas long videos require strategic compression of visual information to handle extensive temporal contexts efficiently. However, our empirical analysis reveals a critical limitation: most existing VLMs suffer severe performance degradation in long video understanding tasks when compressing visual tokens below a quarter of their original visual tokens. To enable more effective modeling of both short and long video inputs, we propose Clapper, a method that utilizes a slow-fast strategy for video representation and introduces a novel module named TimePerceiver for efficient temporal-spatial encoding within existing VLM backbones. By using our method, we achieves 13x compression of visual tokens per frame (averaging 61 tokens/frame) without compromising QA accuracy. In our experiments, Clapper achieves 62.0% on VideoMME, 69.8% on MLVU, and 67.4% on TempCompass, all with fewer than 6,000 visual tokens per video. The code will be publicly available on the homepage.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a variety of computer vision tasks. However, the multimodal reasoning capability has not been fully explored in existing models. In this paper, we propose a Chain-of-Focus (CoF) method that allows VLMs to perform adaptive focusing and zooming in on key image regions based on obtained visual cues and the given questions, achieving efficient multimodal reasoning. To enable this CoF capability, we present a two-stage training pipeline, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct the MM-CoF dataset, comprising 3K samples derived from a visual agent designed to adaptively identify key regions to solve visual tasks with different image resolutions and questions. We use MM-CoF to fine-tune the Qwen2.5-VL model for cold start. In the RL stage, we leverage the outcome accuracies and formats as rewards to update the Qwen2.5-VL model, enabling further refining the search and reasoning strategy of models without human priors. Our model achieves significant improvements on multiple benchmarks. On the V* benchmark that requires strong visual reasoning capability, our model outperforms existing VLMs by 5% among 8 image resolutions ranging from 224 to 4K, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed CoF method and facilitating the more efficient deployment of VLMs in practical applications.

  Reasoning about temporal causality, particularly irreversible transformations of objects governed by real-world knowledge (e.g., fruit decay and human aging), is a fundamental aspect of human visual understanding. Unlike temporal perception based on simple event sequences, this form of reasoning requires a deeper comprehension of how object states change over time. Although the current powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a wide range of downstream tasks, their capacity to reason about temporal causality remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{TimeCausality}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the causal reasoning ability of VLMs in the temporal dimension. Based on our TimeCausality, we find that while the current SOTA open-source VLMs have achieved performance levels comparable to closed-source models like GPT-4o on various standard visual question answering tasks, they fall significantly behind on our benchmark compared with their closed-source competitors. Furthermore, even GPT-4o exhibits a marked drop in performance on TimeCausality compared to its results on other tasks. These findings underscore the critical need to incorporate temporal causality into the evaluation and development of VLMs, and they highlight an important challenge for the open-source VLM community moving forward.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical Vision-Language Models (MVLMs) have achieved par excellence generalization in medical image analysis, yet their performance under noisy, corrupted conditions remains largely untested. Clinical imaging is inherently susceptible to acquisition artifacts and noise; however, existing evaluations predominantly assess generally clean datasets, overlooking robustness -- i.e., the model's ability to perform under real-world distortions. To address this gap, we first introduce MediMeta-C, a corruption benchmark that systematically applies several perturbations across multiple medical imaging datasets. Combined with MedMNIST-C, this establishes a comprehensive robustness evaluation framework for MVLMs. We further propose RobustMedCLIP, a visual encoder adaptation of a pretrained MVLM that incorporates few-shot tuning to enhance resilience against corruptions. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark 5 major MVLMs across 5 medical imaging modalities, revealing that existing models exhibit severe degradation under corruption and struggle with domain-modality tradeoffs. Our findings highlight the necessity of diverse training and robust adaptation strategies, demonstrating that efficient low-rank adaptation when paired with few-shot tuning, improves robustness while preserving generalization across modalities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent developments in Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have enabled models to process long video sequences and demonstrate remarkable performance. Nonetheless, studies predominantly focus on offline video question answering, neglecting memory usage and response speed that are essential in various real-world applications, such as Deepseek services, autonomous driving, and robotics. To mitigate these challenges, we propose $\textbf{LiveVLM}$, a training-free framework specifically designed for streaming, online video understanding and real-time interaction. Unlike existing works that process videos only after one question is posed, LiveVLM constructs an innovative streaming-oriented KV cache to process video streams in real-time, retain long-term video details and eliminate redundant KVs, ensuring prompt responses to user queries. For continuous video streams, LiveVLM generates and compresses video key-value tensors (video KVs) to reserve visual information while improving memory efficiency. Furthermore, when a new question is proposed, LiveVLM incorporates an online question-answering process that efficiently fetches both short-term and long-term visual information, while minimizing interference from redundant context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LiveVLM enables the foundation LLaVA-OneVision model to process 44$\times$ number of frames on the same device, and achieves up to 5$\times$ speedup in response speed compared with SoTA online methods at an input of 256 frames, while maintaining the same or better model performance.

  Cinematography is a cornerstone of film production and appreciation, shaping mood, emotion, and narrative through visual elements such as camera movement, shot composition, and lighting. Despite recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and video generation models, the capacity of current models to grasp and reproduce cinematographic techniques remains largely uncharted, hindered by the scarcity of expert-annotated data. To bridge this gap, we present CineTechBench, a pioneering benchmark founded on precise, manual annotation by seasoned cinematography experts across key cinematography dimensions. Our benchmark covers seven essential aspects-shot scale, shot angle, composition, camera movement, lighting, color, and focal length-and includes over 600 annotated movie images and 120 movie clips with clear cinematographic techniques. For the understanding task, we design question answer pairs and annotated descriptions to assess MLLMs' ability to interpret and explain cinematographic techniques. For the generation task, we assess advanced video generation models on their capacity to reconstruct cinema-quality camera movements given conditions such as textual prompts or keyframes. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on 15+ MLLMs and 5+ video generation models. Our results offer insights into the limitations of current models and future directions for cinematography understanding and generation in automatically film production and appreciation.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of tasks, yet concerns about their potential biases exist. This work investigates the extent to which prominent VLMs exhibit cultural biases by evaluating their performance on an image-based country identification task at a country level. Utilizing the geographically diverse Country211 dataset, we probe several large vision language models (VLMs) under various prompting strategies: open-ended questions, multiple-choice questions (MCQs) including challenging setups like multilingual and adversarial settings. Our analysis aims to uncover disparities in model accuracy across different countries and question formats, providing insights into how training data distribution and evaluation methodologies might influence cultural biases in VLMs. The findings highlight significant variations in performance, suggesting that while VLMs possess considerable visual understanding, they inherit biases from their pre-training data and scale that impact their ability to generalize uniformly across diverse global contexts.

  Advances in AI generative models facilitate super-realistic video synthesis, amplifying misinformation risks via social media and eroding trust in digital content. Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.

  Despite impressive advancements in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal tasks, their reliance on RGB inputs limits precise spatial understanding. Existing methods for integrating spatial cues, such as point clouds or depth, either require specialized sensors or fail to effectively exploit depth information for higher-order reasoning. To this end, we propose a novel Spatial Sense and Reasoning method, dubbed SSR, a novel framework that transforms raw depth data into structured, interpretable textual rationales. These textual rationales serve as meaningful intermediate representations to significantly enhance spatial reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we leverage knowledge distillation to compress the generated rationales into compact latent embeddings, which facilitate resource-efficient and plug-and-play integration into existing VLMs without retraining. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new dataset named SSR-CoT, a million-scale visual-language reasoning dataset enriched with intermediate spatial reasoning annotations, and present SSRBench, a comprehensive multi-task benchmark. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate SSR substantially improves depth utilization and enhances spatial reasoning, thereby advancing VLMs toward more human-like multi-modal understanding.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video spatial reasoning, which involves inferring the underlying spatial structure from observed video frames, poses a significant challenge for existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This limitation stems primarily from 1) the absence of high-quality datasets for this task, and 2) the lack of effective training strategies to develop spatial reasoning capabilities. Motivated by the success of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) in unlocking LLM reasoning abilities, this work aims to improve MLLMs in video spatial reasoning through the RLVR paradigm. To this end, we introduce the $\textbf{SpaceR}$ framework. First, we present $\textbf{SpaceR-151k}$, a dataset with 91k questions spanning diverse spatial reasoning scenarios with verifiable answers, and 60k samples for maintaining general multimodal understanding. Second, we propose $\textbf{Spatially-Guided RLVR (SG-RLVR)}$, a novel reinforcement learning approach that extends Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel map imagination mechanism, which encourages the model to infer spatial layouts in the thinking process, thereby facilitating more effective spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceR achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks (e.g., VSI-Bench, STI-Bench, and SPAR-Bench), while maintaining competitive results on video understanding benchmarks (e.g., Video-MME, TempCompass, and LongVideoBench). Remarkably, SpaceR surpasses the advanced GPT-4o by 11.6\% accuracy on VSI-Bench and is on par with the leading proprietary model Gemini-2.0-Flash, highlighting the effectiveness of our SpaceR-151k dataset and SG-RLVR in reinforcing spatial reasoning ability of MLLMs. Code, model, and dataset are available atthis https URL.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have tremendous potential to improve the accuracy, availability, and cost-effectiveness of healthcare by providing automated solutions or serving as aids to medical professionals. Despite promising first steps in developing medical MLLMs in the past few years, their capabilities and limitations are not well-understood. Recently, many benchmark datasets have been proposed that test the general medical knowledge of such models across a variety of medical areas. However, the systematic failure modes and vulnerabilities of such models are severely underexplored with most medical benchmarks failing to expose the shortcomings of existing models in this safety-critical domain. In this paper, we introduce MediConfusion, a challenging medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark dataset, that probes the failure modes of medical MLLMs from a vision perspective. We reveal that state-of-the-art models are easily confused by image pairs that are otherwise visually dissimilar and clearly distinct for medical experts. Strikingly, all available models (open-source or proprietary) achieve performance below random guessing on MediConfusion, raising serious concerns about the reliability of existing medical MLLMs for healthcare deployment. We also extract common patterns of model failure that may help the design of a new generation of more trustworthy and reliable MLLMs in healthcare.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) serve as general-purpose end-to-end models in autonomous driving, performing subtasks such as prediction, planning, and perception through question-and-answer interactions. However, most existing methods rely on computationally expensive visual encoders and large language models (LLMs), making them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios and real-time applications. Meanwhile, most existing VLMs lack the ability to process multiple images, making it difficult to adapt to multi-camera perception in autonomous driving. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called MiniDrive, which incorporates our proposed Feature Engineering Mixture of Experts (FE-MoE) module and Dynamic Instruction Adapter (DI-Adapter). The FE-MoE effectively maps 2D features into visual token embeddings before being input into the language model. The DI-Adapter enables the visual token embeddings to dynamically change with the instruction text embeddings, resolving the issue of static visual token embeddings for the same image in previous approaches. Compared to previous works, MiniDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of parameter size, floating point operations, and response efficiency, with the smallest version containing only 83M parameters.

  Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have emerged as the preferred tools for judging text-image alignment, yet their robustness along the visual modality remains underexplored. This work is the first study to address a key research question: Can adversarial visual manipulations systematically fool LVLM judges into assigning unfairly inflated scores? We define potential image induced biases within the context of T2I evaluation and examine how these biases affect the evaluations of LVLM judges. Moreover, we introduce a novel, fine-grained, multi-domain meta-evaluation benchmark named FRAME, which is deliberately constructed to exhibit diverse score distributions. By introducing the defined biases into the benchmark, we reveal that all tested LVLM judges exhibit vulnerability across all domains, consistently inflating scores for manipulated images. Further analysis reveals that combining multiple biases amplifies their effects, and pairwise evaluations are similarly susceptible. Moreover, we observe that visual biases persist under prompt-based mitigation strategies, highlighting the vulnerability of current LVLM evaluation systems and underscoring the urgent need for more robust LVLM judges.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for more comprehensive evaluation methods to accurately assess their reasoning capabilities. Existing benchmarks are often domain-specific and thus cannot fully capture an LLM's general reasoning potential. To address this limitation, we introduce the Knowledge Orthogonal Reasoning Gymnasium (KORGym), a dynamic evaluation platform inspired by KOR-Bench and Gymnasium. KORGym offers over fifty games in either textual or visual formats and supports interactive, multi-turn assessments with reinforcement learning scenarios. Using KORGym, we conduct extensive experiments on 19 LLMs and 8 VLMs, revealing consistent reasoning patterns within model families and demonstrating the superior performance of closed-source models. Further analysis examines the effects of modality, reasoning strategies, reinforcement learning techniques, and response length on model performance. We expect KORGym to become a valuable resource for advancing LLM reasoning research and developing evaluation methodologies suited to complex, interactive environments.

  The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages, focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present the first comprehensive study of Memorization in Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs), analyzing 95 languages using models across diverse model scales, architectures, and memorization definitions. As MLLMs are increasingly deployed, understanding their memorization behavior has become critical. Yet prior work has focused primarily on monolingual models, leaving multilingual memorization underexplored, despite the inherently long-tailed nature of training corpora. We find that the prevailing assumption, that memorization is highly correlated with training data availability, fails to fully explain memorization patterns in MLLMs. We hypothesize that treating languages in isolation - ignoring their similarities - obscures the true patterns of memorization. To address this, we propose a novel graph-based correlation metric that incorporates language similarity to analyze cross-lingual memorization. Our analysis reveals that among similar languages, those with fewer training tokens tend to exhibit higher memorization, a trend that only emerges when cross-lingual relationships are explicitly modeled. These findings underscore the importance of a language-aware perspective in evaluating and mitigating memorization vulnerabilities in MLLMs. This also constitutes empirical evidence that language similarity both explains Memorization in MLLMs and underpins Cross-lingual Transferability, with broad implications for multilingual NLP.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents new opportunities for chart understanding. However, due to the fine-grained nature of these tasks, applying MLLMs typically requires large, high-quality datasets for task-specific fine-tuning, leading to high data collection and training costs. To address this, we propose ChartCards, a unified chart-metadata generation framework for multi-task chart understanding. ChartCards systematically synthesizes various chart information, including data tables, visualization code, visual elements, and multi-dimensional semantic captions. By structuring this information into organized metadata, ChartCards enables a single chart to support multiple downstream tasks, such as text-to-chart retrieval, chart summarization, chart-to-table conversion, chart description, and chart question answering. Using ChartCards, we further construct MetaChart, a large-scale high-quality dataset containing 10,862 data tables, 85K charts, and 170 K high-quality chart captions. We validate the dataset through qualitative crowdsourcing evaluations and quantitative fine-tuning experiments across various chart understanding tasks. Fine-tuning six different models on MetaChart resulted in an average performance improvement of 5% across all tasks. The most notable improvements are seen in text-to-chart retrieval and chart-to-table tasks, with Long-CLIP and Llama 3.2-11B achieving improvements of 17% and 28%, respectively.

  Video Comment Art enhances user engagement by providing creative content that conveys humor, satire, or emotional resonance, requiring a nuanced and comprehensive grasp of cultural and contextual subtleties. Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in STEM tasks (e.g. mathematics and coding), they still struggle to generate creative expressions such as resonant jokes and insightful satire. Moreover, existing benchmarks are constrained by their limited modalities and insufficient categories, hindering the exploration of comprehensive creativity in video-based Comment Art creation. To address these limitations, we introduce GODBench, a novel benchmark that integrates video and text modalities to systematically evaluate MLLMs' abilities to compose Comment Art. Furthermore, inspired by the propagation patterns of waves in physics, we propose Ripple of Thought (RoT), a multi-step reasoning framework designed to enhance the creativity of MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal that existing MLLMs and CoT methods still face significant challenges in understanding and generating creative video comments. In contrast, RoT provides an effective approach to improve creative composing, highlighting its potential to drive meaningful advancements in MLLM-based creativity.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in diverse reasoning tasks, yet their application to complex physics reasoning remains underexplored. Physics reasoning presents unique challenges, requiring grounding in physical conditions and the interpretation of multimodal information. Current physics benchmarks are limited, often focusing on text-only inputs or solely on problem-solving, thereby overlooking the critical intermediate steps of variable identification and process formulation. To address these limitations, we introduce PhysicsArena, the first multimodal physics reasoning benchmark designed to holistically evaluate MLLMs across three critical dimensions: variable identification, physical process formulation, and solution derivation. PhysicsArena aims to provide a comprehensive platform for assessing and advancing the multimodal physics reasoning abilities of MLLMs.

  Web navigation is a unique domain that can automate many repetitive real-life tasks and is challenging as it requires long-horizon sequential decision making beyond typical multimodal large language model (MLLM) tasks. Yet, specialized reward models for web navigation that can be utilized during both training and test-time have been absent until now. Despite the importance of speed and cost-effectiveness, prior works have utilized MLLMs as reward models, which poses significant constraints for real-world deployment. To address this, in this work, we propose the first process reward model (PRM) called Web-Shepherd which could assess web navigation trajectories in a step-level. To achieve this, we first construct the WebPRM Collection, a large-scale dataset with 40K step-level preference pairs and annotated checklists spanning diverse domains and difficulty levels. Next, we also introduce the WebRewardBench, the first meta-evaluation benchmark for evaluating PRMs. In our experiments, we observe that our Web-Shepherd achieves about 30 points better accuracy compared to using GPT-4o on WebRewardBench. Furthermore, when testing on WebArena-lite by using GPT-4o-mini as the policy and Web-Shepherd as the verifier, we achieve 10.9 points better performance, in 10 less cost compared to using GPT-4o-mini as the verifier. Our model, dataset, and code are publicly available at LINK.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have led to strong reasoning ability across a wide range of tasks. However, their ability to perform mathematical reasoning from spoken input remains underexplored. Prior studies on speech modality have mostly focused on factual speech understanding or simple audio reasoning tasks, providing limited insight into logical step-by-step reasoning, such as that required for mathematical problem solving. To address this gap, we introduce Spoken Math Question Answering (Spoken-MQA), a new benchmark designed to evaluate the mathematical reasoning capabilities of speech-based models, including both cascade models (ASR + LLMs) and end-to-end speech LLMs. Spoken-MQA covers a diverse set of math problems, including pure arithmetic, single-step and multi-step contextual reasoning, and knowledge-oriented reasoning problems, all presented in unambiguous natural spoken language. Through extensive experiments, we find that: (1) while some speech LLMs perform competitively on contextual reasoning tasks involving basic arithmetic, they still struggle with direct arithmetic problems; (2) current LLMs exhibit a strong bias toward symbolic mathematical expressions written in LaTex and have difficulty interpreting verbalized mathematical expressions; and (3) mathematical knowledge reasoning abilities are significantly degraded in current speech LLMs.

  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in globally distributed applications, such as tourism assistants, yet their ability to produce culturally appropriate responses remains underexplored. Existing multimodal safety benchmarks primarily focus on physical safety and overlook violations rooted in cultural norms, which can result in symbolic harm. To address this gap, we introduce CROSS, a benchmark designed to assess the cultural safety reasoning capabilities of LVLMs. CROSS includes 1,284 multilingual visually grounded queries from 16 countries, three everyday domains, and 14 languages, where cultural norm violations emerge only when images are interpreted in context. We propose CROSS-Eval, an intercultural theory-based framework that measures four key dimensions: cultural awareness, norm education, compliance, and helpfulness. Using this framework, we evaluate 21 leading LVLMs, including mixture-of-experts models and reasoning models. Results reveal significant cultural safety gaps: the best-performing model achieves only 61.79% in awareness and 37.73% in compliance. While some open-source models reach GPT-4o-level performance, they still fall notably short of proprietary models. Our results further show that increasing reasoning capacity improves cultural alignment but does not fully resolve the issue. To improve model performance, we develop two enhancement strategies: supervised fine-tuning with culturally grounded, open-ended data and preference tuning with contrastive response pairs that highlight safe versus unsafe behaviors. These methods substantially improve GPT-4o's cultural awareness (+60.14%) and compliance (+55.2%), while preserving general multimodal capabilities with minimal performance reduction on general multimodal understanding benchmarks.

  In the field of urban planning, existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) frequently fail to effectively analyze and evaluate planning maps, despite the critical importance of these visual elements for urban planners and related educational contexts. Planning maps, which visualize land use, infrastructure layouts, and functional zoning, require specialized understanding of spatial configurations, regulatory requirements, and multi-scale analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce PlanGPT-VL, the first domain-specific Vision-Language Model tailored specifically for urban planning maps. PlanGPT-VL employs three innovative approaches: (1) PlanAnno-V framework for high-quality VQA data synthesis, (2) Critical Point Thinking to reduce hallucinations through structured verification, and (3) comprehensive training methodology combining Supervised Fine-Tuning with frozen vision encoder parameters. Through systematic evaluation on our proposed PlanBench-V benchmark, we demonstrate that PlanGPT-VL significantly outperforms general-purpose state-of-the-art VLMs in specialized planning map interpretation tasks, offering urban planning professionals a reliable tool for map analysis, assessment, and educational applications while maintaining high factual accuracy. Our lightweight 7B parameter model achieves comparable performance to models exceeding 72B parameters, demonstrating efficient domain specialization without sacrificing performance.

  Recent advances in reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance in complex tasks, yet medical AI models often overlook the structured reasoning processes inherent in clinical practice. In this work, we present ChestX-Reasoner, a radiology diagnosis MLLM designed to leverage process supervision mined directly from clinical reports, reflecting the step-by-step reasoning followed by radiologists. We construct a large dataset by extracting and refining reasoning chains from routine radiology reports. Our two-stage training framework combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning guided by process rewards to better align model reasoning with clinical standards. We introduce RadRBench-CXR, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 59K visual question answering samples with 301K clinically validated reasoning steps, and propose RadRScore, a metric evaluating reasoning factuality, completeness, and effectiveness. ChestX-Reasoner outperforms existing medical and general-domain MLLMs in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning ability, achieving 16%, 5.9%, and 18% improvements in reasoning ability compared to the best medical MLLM, the best general MLLM, and its base model, respectively, as well as 3.3%, 24%, and 27% improvements in outcome accuracy. All resources are open-sourced to facilitate further research in medical reasoning MLLMs.

  The application of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) constitutes a rapidly advancing research area. While MLLMs extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle diverse modalities such as vision, audio, and video, enabling robust reasoning across multimodal inputs remains challenging. This paper provides a systematic review of recent advances in RL-based reasoning for MLLMs, covering key algorithmic designs, reward mechanism innovations, and practical applications. We highlight two main RL paradigms, value-model-free and value-model-based methods, and analyze how RL enhances reasoning abilities by optimizing reasoning trajectories and aligning multimodal information. Additionally, we provide an extensive overview of benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and current limitations, and propose future research directions to address challenges such as sparse rewards, inefficient cross-modal reasoning, and real-world deployment constraints. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and structured guide to RL-based multimodal reasoning.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in mathematical reasoning within visual contexts across various datasets. However, most existing multimodal math benchmarks are limited to single-visual contexts, which diverges from the multi-visual scenarios commonly encountered in real-world mathematical applications. To address this gap, we introduce MV-MATH: a meticulously curated dataset of 2,009 high-quality mathematical problems. Each problem integrates multiple images interleaved with text, derived from authentic K-12 scenarios, and enriched with detailed annotations. MV-MATH includes multiple-choice, free-form, and multi-step questions, covering 11 subject areas across 3 difficulty levels, and serves as a comprehensive and rigorous benchmark for assessing MLLMs' mathematical reasoning in multi-visual contexts. Through extensive experimentation, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in multi-visual math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on MV-MATH. Furthermore, we analyze the performance and error patterns of various models, providing insights into MLLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities within multi-visual settings.

  Assessments play a vital role in a student's learning process. This is because they provide valuable feedback crucial to a student's growth. Such assessments contain questions with open-ended responses, which are difficult to grade at scale. These responses often require students to express their understanding through textual and visual elements together as a unit. In order to develop scalable assessment tools for such questions, one needs multimodal LLMs having strong comparative reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities. Thus, to facilitate research in this area, we propose the Multimodal Short Answer grading with Feedback (MMSAF) problem along with a dataset of 2,197 data points. Additionally, we provide an automated framework for generating such datasets. As per our evaluations, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) could predict whether an answer is correct, incorrect or partially correct with an accuracy of 55%. Similarly, they could predict whether the image provided in the student's answer is relevant or not with an accuracy of 75%. As per human experts, Pixtral was more aligned towards human judgement and values for biology and ChatGPT for physics and chemistry and achieved a score of 4 or more out of 5 in most parameters.
