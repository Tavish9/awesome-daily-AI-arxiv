- **[ForceVLA: Enhancing VLA Models with a Force-aware MoE for Contact-rich Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22159)**  `arXiv:2505.22159`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced general-purpose robotic manipulation by leveraging pretrained visual and linguistic representations. However, they struggle with contact-rich tasks that require fine-grained control involving force, especially under visual occlusion or dynamic uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose ForceVLA, a novel end-to-end manipulation framework that treats external force sensing as a first-class modality within VLA systems. ForceVLA introduces FVLMoE, a force-aware Mixture-of-Experts fusion module that dynamically integrates pretrained visual-language embeddings with real-time 6-axis force feedback during action decoding. This enables context-aware routing across modality-specific experts, enhancing the robot's ability to adapt to subtle contact dynamics. We also introduce \textbf{ForceVLA-Data}, a new dataset comprising synchronized vision, proprioception, and force-torque signals across five contact-rich manipulation tasks. ForceVLA improves average task success by 23.2% over strong pi_0-based baselines, achieving up to 80% success in tasks such as plug insertion. Our approach highlights the importance of multimodal integration for dexterous manipulation and sets a new benchmark for physically intelligent robotic control.

  The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task requires an agent to follow natural language instructions and navigate through complex environments. Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However, prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations. Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches despite using a smaller model. Code and data will be released soon.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating textual descriptions from visual data. While these models excel on web-scale datasets, their robustness to the domain shifts inherent in many real-world applications remains under-explored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of VLM performance on a single-view object captioning task when faced with a controlled, physical domain shift. We compare captioning accuracy across two distinct object sets: a collection of multi-material, real-world tools and a set of single-material, 3D-printed items. The 3D-printed set introduces a significant domain shift in texture and material properties, challenging the models' generalization capabilities. Our quantitative results demonstrate that all tested VLMs show a marked performance degradation when describing the 3D-printed objects compared to the real-world tools. This underscores a critical limitation in the ability of current models to generalize beyond surface-level features and highlights the need for more robust architectures for real-world signal processing applications.

- **[TrojanRobot: Physical-world Backdoor Attacks Against VLM-based Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11683)**  `arXiv:2411.11683`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic manipulation in the physical world is increasingly empowered by \textit{large language models} (LLMs) and \textit{vision-language models} (VLMs), leveraging their understanding and perception capabilities. Recently, various attacks against such robotic policies have been proposed, with backdoor attacks drawing considerable attention for their high stealth and strong persistence capabilities. However, existing backdoor efforts are limited to simulators and suffer from physical-world realization. To address this, we propose \textit{TrojanRobot}, a highly stealthy and broadly effective robotic backdoor attack in the physical world. Specifically, we introduce a module-poisoning approach by embedding a backdoor module into the modular robotic policy, enabling backdoor control over the policy's visual perception module thereby backdooring the entire robotic policy. Our vanilla implementation leverages a backdoor-finetuned VLM to serve as the backdoor module. To enhance its generalization in physical environments, we propose a prime implementation, leveraging the LVLM-as-a-backdoor paradigm and developing three types of prime attacks, \ie, \textit{permutation}, \textit{stagnation}, and \textit{intentional} attacks, thus achieving finer-grained backdoors. Extensive experiments on the UR3e manipulator with 18 task instructions using robotic policies based on four VLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness and physical-world stealth of TrojanRobot. Our attack's video demonstrations are available via a github linkthis https URL.

- **[Sign Language: Towards Sign Understanding for Robot Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02556)**  `arXiv:2506.02556`  `cs.RO`  
  _Ayush Agrawal, Joel Loo, Nicky Zimmerman, David Hsu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Navigational signs are common aids for human wayfinding and scene understanding, but are underutilized by robots. We argue that they benefit robot navigation and scene understanding, by directly encoding privileged information on actions, spatial regions, and relations. Interpreting signs in open-world settings remains a challenge owing to the complexity of scenes and signs, but recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) make this feasible. To advance progress in this area, we introduce the task of navigational sign understanding which parses locations and associated directions from signs. We offer a benchmark for this task, proposing appropriate evaluation metrics and curating a test set capturing signs with varying complexity and design across diverse public spaces, from hospitals to shopping malls to transport hubs. We also provide a baseline approach using VLMs, and demonstrate their promise on navigational sign understanding. Code and dataset are available on Github.

- **[Search-TTA: A Multimodal Test-Time Adaptation Framework for Visual Search in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11350)**  `arXiv:2505.11350`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To perform outdoor autonomous visual navigation and search, a robot may leverage satellite imagery as a prior map. This can help inform high-level search and exploration strategies, even when such images lack sufficient resolution to allow for visual recognition of targets. However, there are limited training datasets of satellite images with annotated targets that are not directly visible. Furthermore, approaches which leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs) for generalization may yield inaccurate outputs due to hallucination, leading to inefficient search. To address these challenges, we introduce Search-TTA, a multimodal test-time adaptation framework with a flexible plug-and-play interface compatible with various input modalities (e.g. image, text, sound) and planning methods. First, we pretrain a satellite image encoder to align with CLIP's visual encoder to output probability distributions of target presence used for visual search. Second, our framework dynamically refines CLIP's predictions during search using a test-time adaptation mechanism. Through a novel feedback loop inspired by Spatial Poisson Point Processes, uncertainty-weighted gradient updates are used to correct potentially inaccurate predictions and improve search performance. To train and evaluate Search-TTA, we curate AVS-Bench, a visual search dataset based on internet-scale ecological data that contains up to 380k training and 8k validation images (in- and out-domain). We find that Search-TTA improves planner performance by up to 30.0%, particularly in cases with poor initial CLIP predictions due to limited training data. It also performs comparably with significantly larger VLMs, and achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen modalities. Finally, we deploy Search-TTA on a real UAV via hardware-in-the-loop testing, by simulating its operation within a large-scale simulation that provides onboard sensing.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been increasingly integrated into object navigation tasks for their rich prior knowledge and strong reasoning abilities. However, applying VLMs to navigation poses two key challenges: effectively representing complex environment information and determining \textit{when and how} to query VLMs. Insufficient environment understanding and over-reliance on VLMs (e.g. querying at every step) can lead to unnecessary backtracking and reduced navigation efficiency, especially in continuous environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that constructs a multi-layer representation of the environment during navigation. This representation consists of viewpoint, object nodes, and room nodes. Viewpoints and object nodes facilitate intra-room exploration and accurate target localization, while room nodes support efficient inter-room planning. Building on this representation, we propose a novel two-stage navigation policy, integrating high-level planning guided by VLM reasoning with low-level VLM-assisted exploration to efficiently locate a goal object. We evaluated our approach on three simulated benchmarks (HM3D, RoboTHOR, and MP3D), and achieved state-of-the-art performance on both the success rate ($\mathord{\uparrow}\, 7.1\%$) and navigation efficiency ($\mathord{\uparrow}\, 12.5\%$). We further validate our method on a real robot platform, demonstrating strong robustness across 15 object navigation tasks in 10 different indoor environments.

- **[Phi: Preference Hijacking in Multi-modal Large Language Models at Inference Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12521)**  `arXiv:2509.12521`  `cs.LG`  
  _Yifan Lan, Yuanpu Cao, Weitong Zhang, Lu Lin, Jinghui Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention across various domains. However, their widespread adoption has also raised serious safety concerns. In this paper, we uncover a new safety risk of MLLMs: the output preference of MLLMs can be arbitrarily manipulated by carefully optimized images. Such attacks often generate contextually relevant yet biased responses that are neither overtly harmful nor unethical, making them difficult to detect. Specifically, we introduce a novel method, Preference Hijacking (Phi), for manipulating the MLLM response preferences using a preference hijacked image. Our method works at inference time and requires no model modifications. Additionally, we introduce a universal hijacking perturbation -- a transferable component that can be embedded into different images to hijack MLLM responses toward any attacker-specified preferences. Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code for Phi is accessible atthis https URL.

- **[AsyMoE: Leveraging Modal Asymmetry for Enhanced Expert Specialization in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12715)**  `arXiv:2509.12715`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Heng Zhang, Haichuan Hu, Yaomin Shen, Weihao Yu, Yilei Yuan, Haochen You, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training. However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups. We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves 26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

- **[VARCO-VISION-2.0 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10105)**  `arXiv:2509.10105`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Young-rok Cha, Jeongho Ju, SunYoung Park, Jong-Hyeon Lee, Younghyun Yu, Youngjune Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce VARCO-VISION-2.0, an open-weight bilingual vision-language model (VLM) for Korean and English with improved capabilities compared to the previous model VARCO-VISION-14B. The model supports multi-image understanding for complex inputs such as documents, charts, and tables, and delivers layoutaware OCR by predicting both textual content and its spatial location. Trained with a four-stage curriculum with memory-efficient techniques, the model achieves enhanced multimodal alignment, while preserving core language abilities and improving safety via preference optimization. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate strong spatial grounding and competitive results for both languages, with the 14B model achieving 8th place on the OpenCompass VLM leaderboard among models of comparable scale. Alongside the 14B-scale model, we release a 1.7B version optimized for on-device deployment. We believe these models advance the development of bilingual VLMs and their practical applications. Two variants of VARCO-VISION-2.0 are available at Hugging Face: a full-scale 14B model and a lightweight 1.7B model.

- **[Teaching Vision-Language Models to Ask: Resolving Ambiguity in Visual Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13773)**  `arXiv:2507.13773`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Pu Jian, Donglei Yu, Wen Yang, Shuo Ren, Jiajun Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In visual question answering (VQA) context, users often pose ambiguous questions to visual language models (VLMs) due to varying expression habits. Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions. These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However, research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1) Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA scenarios.

- **[Perception Before Reasoning: Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning for Visual Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13031)**  `arXiv:2509.13031`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yan Chen, Long Li, Teng Xi, Long Zeng, Jingdong Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance. However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

- **[Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing: Enhancing Visual Understanding via Sustained Focus on Key Objects in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12897)**  `arXiv:2509.12897`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Jianfei Zhao, Feng Zhang, Xin Sun, Lingxing Kong, Zhixing Tan, Chong Feng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers, the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly. Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

  _Yunhan Zhao, Xiang Zheng, Xingjun Ma_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components: (1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

  _Wanru Zhuang, Wenbo Li, Zhibin Lan, Xu Han, Peng Li, Jinsong Su_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks: regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the scalability and generalizability of our training data

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however, they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes open-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.

- **[Adversarial Prompt Distillation for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15244)**  `arXiv:2411.15244`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their deployment in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. One promising approach for robustifying pre-trained VLMs is Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT), which applies adversarial training during the process of prompt tuning. However, existing APT methods are mostly single-modal methods that design prompt(s) for only the visual or textual modality, limiting their effectiveness in either robustness or clean accuracy. In this work, we propose Adversarial Prompt Distillation (APD), a bimodal knowledge distillation framework that enhances APT by integrating it with multi-modal knowledge transfer. APD optimizes prompts for both visual and textual modalities while distilling knowledge from a clean pre-trained teacher CLIP model. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our APD method over the current state-of-the-art APT methods in terms of both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy. The effectiveness of APD also validates the possibility of using a non-robust teacher to improve the generalization and robustness of fine-tuned VLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings, which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth 3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric measurements.

- **[HERO: Rethinking Visual Token Early Dropping in High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13067)**  `arXiv:2509.13067`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xu Li, Yuxuan Liang, Xiaolei Chen, Yi Zheng, Haotian Chen, Bin Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities. However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient inference in HR-LVLMs.

- **[Brought a Gun to a Knife Fight: Modern VFM Baselines Outgun Specialized Detectors on In-the-Wild AI Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12995)**  `arXiv:2509.12995`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yue Zhou, Xinan He, Kaiqing Lin, Bing Fan, Feng Ding, Jinhua Zeng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder, Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date, ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection, the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the `craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history, including pre-training.

  Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb, target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1) inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally, comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities. To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

  Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge. Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM, equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced editing tools without additional fine-tuning.Code is available:this https URL.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations, including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment. Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1) descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size, dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

  Recent video diffusion models have demonstrated their great capability in generating visually-pleasing results, while synthesizing the correct physical effects in generated videos remains challenging. The complexity of real-world motions, interactions, and dynamics introduce great difficulties when learning physics from data. In this work, we propose DiffPhy, a generic framework that enables physically-correct and photo-realistic video generation by fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion model. Our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to explicitly reason a comprehensive physical context from the text prompt and use it to guide the generation. To incorporate physical context into the diffusion model, we leverage a Multimodal large language model (MLLM) as a supervisory signal and introduce a set of novel training objectives that jointly enforce physical correctness and semantic consistency with the input text. We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPhy is able to produce state-of-the-art results across diverse physics-related scenarios.

  Over-reliance on language priors is a major cause of hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), often leading to outputs that are linguistically plausible but visually inconsistent. Recent studies have explored contrastive decoding as a training-free solution. However, these methods typically construct contrastive visual inputs by perturbing the original image, resulting in distorted contrastive distributions, incomplete contrastive signals, and excessive suppression of language priors. Motivated by the observation that language priors tend to remain consistent across different images, we propose Cross-Image Contrastive Decoding (CICD), a simple yet effective training-free method that uses unrelated images as contrastive visual inputs. To address the issue of over-suppressing language priors, which can negatively affect the quality of generated responses, we further introduce a dynamic selection mechanism based on the cross-image differences in model behavior. By selectively suppressing language priors, our method reduces hallucinations without compromising the model's performance. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of CICD, particularly in image captioning, where language priors are especially dominant.

  Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.

  Humans can recognize an image as an instance of a general concept, beyond simply identifying its objects and their relationships. In this paper, we investigate 1. The extent to which VLMs have this concept abstraction capacity, and 2. Strategies for encoding the sort of higher-concept information in images that would enable the resulting VLM model (CLEAR GLASS model) to have this capability to a greater degree. To this end, we introduce a grouped image-caption dataset (MAGIC), which consists of several groups of image captions and for each group a set of associated images and higher-level conceptual labels. We use a novel contrastive loss technique to induce the model to encode in the representation of each image (caption) in a group the information that is common to all members of the image-caption group. Our main contribution is a grouped contrastive loss function based on text-image contrastive groups (outer contrastive loss) as well as an inner loss which measures the distances between image-caption instances in the group. Our training methodology results in the CLEAR GLASS model having the concept abstraction capacity as an emergent capacity because the model is not exposed to the higher-level concepts associated with each group. Instead, the training forces the model to create for each image-caption group a semantic representation that brings it closer to the semantic representation of the higher-level concepts in the latent semantic space. Our experiments show that this training methodology results in a model which shows improvement in abstract concept recognition compared to SOTA models.

  Text-based person search (TBPS) enables the retrieval of person images from large-scale databases using natural language descriptions, offering critical value in surveillance applications. However, a major challenge lies in the labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic, dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague, incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy, robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.

  Real-world vision language reasoning scenarios often include diverse and complex tasks. However, vision language reinforcement learning has primarily focused on a narrow set of tasks (e.g. geometry or chart reasoning), limiting the improvement of Vision Language Models' (VLMs) general reasoning. Therefore, we propose a novel Code2Logic approach, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize verifiable game reasoning tasks at scale via adapting game code. Using the Code2Logic, we developed the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is verifiable and scalable, offers controllable difficulty gradation and is diverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Then we apply Game-RL, which is simple reinforcement learning on GameQA. Surprisingly, despite training solely on game tasks, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization, specifically Qwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33% across 7 diverse vision-language benchmarks. Our code, dataset and models are available at the GitHub repository.

  Understanding user intents from UI interaction trajectories remains a challenging, yet crucial, frontier in intelligent agent development. While massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base performance of large MLLMs.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are susceptible to the implicit reasoning risk, wherein innocuous unimodal inputs synergistically assemble into risky multimodal data that produce harmful outputs. We attribute this vulnerability to the difficulty of MLLMs maintaining safety alignment through long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce Safe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI), the first dataset featuring interpretable reasoning paths tailored for such a cross-modal challenge. A novel training framework, Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO), is also designed based on the SSUI dataset to align the MLLM's internal reasoning process with human safety values. Experimental results show that our SRPO-trained models achieve state-of-the-art results on key safety benchmarks, including the proposed Reasoning Path Benchmark (RSBench), significantly outperforming both open-source and top-tier commercial MLLMs.
