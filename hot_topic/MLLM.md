- **[Simultaneous Localization and Affordance Prediction of Tasks from Egocentric Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13856)**  `arXiv:2407.13856`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great success as foundational models for downstream vision and natural language applications in a variety of domains. However, these models are limited to reasoning over objects and actions currently visible on the image plane. We present a spatial extension to the VLM, which leverages spatially-localized egocentric video demonstrations to augment VLMs in two ways -- through understanding spatial task-affordances, i.e. where an agent must be for the task to physically take place, and the localization of that task relative to the egocentric viewer. We show our approach outperforms the baseline of using a VLM to map similarity of a task's description over a set of location-tagged images. Our approach has less error both on predicting where a task may take place and on predicting what tasks are likely to happen at the current location. The resulting representation will enable robots to use egocentric sensing to navigate to, or around, physical regions of interest for novel tasks specified in natural language.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise for autonomous driving, yet their struggle with hallucinations, inefficient reasoning, and limited real-world validation hinders accurate perception and robust step-by-step reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce AgentThink, a pioneering unified framework that, for the first time, integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with dynamic, agent-style tool invocation for autonomous driving tasks. AgentThink's core innovations include: (i) Structured Data Generation, by establishing an autonomous driving tool library to automatically construct structured, self-verified reasoning data explicitly incorporating tool usage for diverse driving scenarios; (ii) A Two-stage Training Pipeline, employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to equip VLMs with the capability for autonomous tool invocation; and (iii) Agent-style Tool-Usage Evaluation, introducing a novel multi-tool assessment protocol to rigorously evaluate the model's tool invocation and utilization. Experiments on the DriveLMM-o1 benchmark demonstrate AgentThink significantly boosts overall reasoning scores by 53.91% and enhances answer accuracy by 33.54%, while markedly improving reasoning quality and consistency. Furthermore, ablation studies and robust zero-shot/few-shot generalization experiments across various benchmarks underscore its powerful capabilities. These findings highlight a promising trajectory for developing trustworthy and tool-aware autonomous driving models.

  Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input integration.

- **[Grounded Vision-Language Navigation for UAVs with Open-Vocabulary Goal Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10756)**  `arXiv:2506.10756`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Yuhang Zhang, Haosheng Yu, Jiaping Xiao, Mir Feroskhan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM) that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover, real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the presence of abstract language input.

- **[Mitigating Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models via Image-Grounded Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08680)**  `arXiv:2402.08680`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has increasingly highlighted the critical issue of their tendency to hallucinate non-existing objects in the images. To address this issue, previous works focused on using specially curated datasets or powerful LLMs to rectify the outputs of LVLMs. However, these approaches require either costly training or fine-tuning, or API access to proprietary LLMs for post-generation correction. In response to these limitations, we propose Mitigating hallucinAtion via image-gRounded guIdaNcE (MARINE), a framework that is both training-free and API-free. MARINE effectively and efficiently reduces object hallucinations during inference by introducing image-grounded guidance to LVLMs. This is achieved by leveraging open-source vision models to extract object-level information, thereby enhancing the precision of LVLM-generated content. Our framework's flexibility further allows for the integration of multiple vision models, enabling more reliable and robust object-level guidance. Through comprehensive evaluations across 5 popular LVLMs with diverse evaluation metrics and benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MARINE, which even outperforms existing fine-tuning-based methods. Remarkably, it reduces hallucinations consistently in GPT-4V-assisted evaluation while maintaining the detailedness of LVLMs' generations. We release our code atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning Finetuning (RFT) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling long chains of thought, self-correction, and effective tool use. While recent works attempt to extend RFT to vision-language models (VLMs), these efforts largely produce text-only reasoning conditioned on static image inputs, falling short of true multimodal reasoning in the response. In contrast, test-time methods like Visual Sketchpad incorporate visual steps but lack training mechanisms.We introduce VTool-R1, the first framework that trains VLMs to generate multimodal chains of thought by interleaving text and intermediate visual reasoning steps. VTool-R1 integrates Python-based visual editing tools into the RFT process, enabling VLMs to learn when and how to generate visual reasoning steps that benefit final reasoning. Trained with outcome-based rewards tied to task accuracy, our approach elicits strategic visual tool use for reasoning without relying on process-based supervision. Experiments on structured visual question answering over charts and tables show that VTool-R1 enhances reasoning performance by teaching VLMs to "think with images" and generate multimodal chain of thoughts with tools.

- **[Graph-MLLM: Harnessing Multimodal Large Language Models for Multimodal Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10282)**  `arXiv:2506.10282`  `cs.LG`  
  _Jiajin Liu, Dongzhe Fan, Jiacheng Shen, Chuanhao Ji, Daochen Zha, Qiaoyu Tan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However, they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs) is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare, and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor. MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning. Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.

  _Tina Khezresmaeilzadeh, Parsa Razmara, Seyedarmin Azizi, Mohammad Erfan Sadeghi, Erfan Baghaei Potraghloo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Stock price prediction remains a complex and high-stakes task in financial analysis, traditionally addressed using statistical models or, more recently, language models. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Vision-Language Inference for Stock Time-series Analysis), a novel, training-free framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal stock forecasting. VISTA prompts a VLM with both textual representations of historical stock prices and their corresponding line charts to predict future price values. By combining numerical and visual modalities in a zero-shot setting and using carefully designed chain-of-thought prompts, VISTA captures complementary patterns that unimodal approaches often miss. We benchmark VISTA against standard baselines, including ARIMA and text-only LLM-based prompting methods. Experimental results show that VISTA outperforms these baselines by up to 89.83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal inference for stock time-series analysis and highlighting the potential of VLMs in financial forecasting tasks without requiring task-specific training.

- **[ViCrit: A Verifiable Reinforcement Learning Proxy Task for Visual Perception in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10128)**  `arXiv:2506.10128`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Xiyao Wang, Zhengyuan Yang, Chao Feng, Yongyuan Liang, Yuhang Zhou, Xiaoyu Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle, synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math, showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Developing generalizable reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by cognitive science literature suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable cognitive skills, we propose a novel post-training paradigm, Visual Game Learning, or ViGaL, where MLLMs develop out-of-domain generalization of multimodal reasoning through playing arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple arcade-like games, e.g. Snake, significantly enhances its downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks like MathVista, and on multi-discipline questions like MMMU, without seeing any worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL, suggesting the capture of transferable reasoning skills. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist models tuned on multimodal reasoning data in multimodal reasoning benchmarks, while preserving the base model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest a new post-training paradigm: synthetic, rule-based games can serve as controllable and scalable pre-text tasks that unlock generalizable multimodal reasoning abilities in MLLMs.

  Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multi-modal understanding by incorporating finer-grained visual perception and encoding. However, such methods incur significant computational costs due to longer visual token sequences, posing challenges for real-time deployment. To mitigate this, prior studies have explored pruning unimportant visual tokens either at the output layer of the visual encoder or at the early layers of the language model. In this work, we revisit these design choices and reassess their effectiveness through comprehensive empirical studies of how visual tokens are processed throughout the visual encoding and language decoding stages. Guided by these insights, we propose VScan, a two-stage visual token reduction framework that addresses token redundancy by: (1) integrating complementary global and local scans with token merging during visual encoding, and (2) introducing pruning at intermediate layers of the language model. Extensive experimental results across four LVLMs validate the effectiveness of VScan in accelerating inference and demonstrate its superior performance over current state-of-the-arts on sixteen benchmarks. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VScan achieves a 2.91$\times$ speedup in prefilling and a 10$\times$ reduction in FLOPs, while retaining 95.4\% of the original performance.

- **[VideoDeepResearch: Long Video Understanding With Agentic Tool Using](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10821)**  `arXiv:2506.10821`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench. Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

  Human activity is moderated by norms; however, supervision for normative reasoning is sparse, particularly where norms are physically- or socially-grounded. We thus present EGONORMIA $\|\epsilon\|$, comprising 1,853 (200 for EGONORMIA-verified) multiple choice questions (MCQs) grounded within egocentric videos of human interactions, enabling the evaluation and improvement of normative reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). EGONORMIA spans seven norm categories: safety, privacy, proxemics, politeness, cooperation, coordination/proactivity, and communication/legibility. To compile this dataset at scale, we propose a novel pipeline to generate grounded MCQs from raw egocentric video. Our work demonstrates that current state-of-the-art VLMs lack robust grounded norm understanding, scoring a maximum of 54% on EGONORMIA and 65% on EGONORMIA-verified, with performance across norm categories indicating significant risks of safety and privacy when VLMs are used in real-world agents. We additionally explore methods for improving normative understanding, demonstrating that a naive retrieval-based generation (RAG) method using EGONORMIA can enhance normative reasoning in VLMs.

- **[Beyond Attention or Similarity: Maximizing Conditional Diversity for Token Pruning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10967)**  `arXiv:2506.10967`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Qizhe Zhang, Mengzhen Liu, Lichen Li, Ming Lu, Yuan Zhang, Junwen Pan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts, leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner, which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Using Vision Language Models to Detect Students' Academic Emotion through Facial Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10334)**  `arXiv:2506.10334`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Deliang Wang, Chao Yang, Gaowei Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000 images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition, with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions, highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content that causes student confusion.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently, vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains, sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap, reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection frameworks.

- **[MedSeg-R: Reasoning Segmentation in Medical Images with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10465)**  `arXiv:2506.10465`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yu Huang, Zelin Peng, Yichen Zhao, Piao Yang, Xiaokang Yang, Wei Shen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions. While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses. Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical images.

- **[HalLoc: Token-level Localization of Hallucinations for Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10286)**  `arXiv:2506.10286`  `cs.CV`  
  _Eunkyu Park, Minyeong Kim, Gunhee Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands. Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient, probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA), instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence, enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g. "my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries - DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal retrievals.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video content comprehension is essential for various applications, ranging from video analysis to interactive systems. Despite advancements in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), these models often struggle to capture the nuanced, spatiotemporal details essential for thorough video analysis. To address this gap, we introduce Video-CoT, a groundbreaking dataset designed to enhance spatiotemporal understanding using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methodologies. Video-CoT contains 192,000 fine-grained spa-tiotemporal question-answer pairs and 23,000 high-quality CoT-annotated samples, providing a solid foundation for evaluating spatiotemporal understanding in video comprehension. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive benchmark for assessing these tasks, with each task featuring 750 images and tailored evaluation metrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that current VLMs face significant challenges in achieving satisfactory performance, high-lighting the difficulties of effective spatiotemporal understanding. Overall, the Video-CoT dataset and benchmark open new avenues for research in multimedia understanding and support future innovations in intelligent systems requiring advanced video analysis capabilities. By making these resources publicly available, we aim to encourage further exploration in this critical area. Project website:this https URL.

  Visual-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (VI-CoT) enables MLLMs to continually update their understanding and decisions based on step-wise intermediate visual states (IVS), much like a human would, which demonstrates impressive success in various tasks, thereby leading to emerged advancements in related benchmarks. Despite promising progress, current benchmarks provide models with relatively fixed IVS, rather than free-style IVS, whch might forcibly distort the original thinking trajectories, failing to evaluate their intrinsic reasoning capabilities. More importantly, existing benchmarks neglect to systematically explore the impact factors that IVS would impart to untamed reasoning performance. To tackle above gaps, we introduce a specialized benchmark termed ViC-Bench, consisting of four representive tasks: maze navigation, jigsaw puzzle, embodied long-horizon planning, and complex counting, where each task has dedicated free-style IVS generation pipeline supporting function calls. To systematically examine VI-CoT capability, we propose a thorough evaluation suite incorporating a progressive three-stage strategy with targeted new metrics. Besides, we establish Incremental Prompting Information Injection (IPII) strategy to ablatively explore the prompting factors for VI-CoT. We extensively conduct evaluations for 18 advanced MLLMs, revealing key insights into their VI-CoT capability. Our proposed benchmark is publicly open at Huggingface.

  This paper introduces the TempVS benchmark, which focuses on temporal grounding and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in image sequences. TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate 38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS, with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available atthis https URL.

  Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

  Adversarial patch attacks pose a major threat to vision systems by embedding localized perturbations that mislead deep models. Traditional defense methods often require retraining or fine-tuning, making them impractical for real-world deployment. We propose a training-free Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VRAG) framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for adversarial patch detection. By retrieving visually similar patches and images that resemble stored attacks in a continuously expanding database, VRAG performs generative reasoning to identify diverse attack types, all without additional training or fine-tuning. We extensively evaluate open-source large-scale VLMs, including Qwen-VL-Plus, Qwen2.5-VL-72B, and UI-TARS-72B-DPO, alongside Gemini-2.0, a closed-source model. Notably, the open-source UI-TARS-72B-DPO model achieves up to 95 percent classification accuracy, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source adversarial patch detection. Gemini-2.0 attains the highest overall accuracy, 98 percent, but remains closed-source. Experimental results demonstrate VRAG's effectiveness in identifying a variety of adversarial patches with minimal human annotation, paving the way for robust, practical defenses against evolving adversarial patch attacks.

  Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure. Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30 mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

  Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise. Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE) benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning 66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

  Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments, we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap, we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm, which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1 outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld, MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively.

  Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action, grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of tasks in the Minecraft environment.
