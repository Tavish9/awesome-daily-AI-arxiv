- **[Training-free Task-oriented Grasp Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04873)**  `arXiv:2502.04873`  `cs.RO`

  This paper presents a training-free pipeline for task-oriented grasp generation that combines pre-trained grasp generation models with vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional approaches that focus solely on stable grasps, our method incorporates task-specific requirements by leveraging the semantic reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We evaluate five querying strategies, each utilizing different visual representations of candidate grasps, and demonstrate significant improvements over a baseline method in both grasp success and task compliance rates, with absolute gains of up to 36.9\% in overall success rate. Our results underline the potential of VLMs to enhance task-oriented manipulation, providing insights for future research in robotic grasping and human-robot interaction.

- **[VCR: A Task for Pixel-Level Complex Reasoning in Vision Language Models via Restoring Occluded Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06462)**  `arXiv:2406.06462`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  We introduce Visual Caption Restoration (VCR), a novel vision-language task that challenges models to accurately restore partially obscured texts using pixel-level hints within images. This task stems from the observation that text embedded in images is intrinsically different from common visual elements and natural language due to the need to align the modalities of vision, text, and text embedded in images. While numerous works have integrated text embedded in images into visual question-answering tasks, approaches to these tasks generally rely on optical character recognition or masked language modeling, thus reducing the task to mainly text-based processing. However, text-based processing becomes ineffective in VCR as accurate text restoration depends on the combined information from provided images, context, and subtle cues from the tiny exposed areas of masked texts. We develop a pipeline to generate synthetic images for the VCR task using image-caption pairs, with adjustable caption visibility to control the task difficulty. With this pipeline, we construct a dataset for VCR called VCR-Wiki using images with captions from Wikipedia, comprising 2.11M English and 346K Chinese entities in both easy and hard split variants. Our results reveal that current vision language models significantly lag behind human performance in the VCR task, and merely fine-tuning the models on our dataset does not lead to notable improvements. We release VCR-Wiki and the data construction code to facilitate future research.

- **[VLLFL: A Vision-Language Model Based Lightweight Federated Learning Framework for Smart Agriculture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13365)**  `arXiv:2504.13365`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In modern smart agriculture, object detection plays a crucial role by enabling automation, precision farming, and monitoring of resources. From identifying crop health and pest infestations to optimizing harvesting processes, accurate object detection enhances both productivity and sustainability. However, training object detection models often requires large-scale data collection and raises privacy concerns, particularly when sensitive agricultural data is distributed across farms. To address these challenges, we propose VLLFL, a vision-language model-based lightweight federated learning framework (VLLFL). It harnesses the generalization and context-aware detection capabilities of the vision-language model (VLM) and leverages the privacy-preserving nature of federated learning. By training a compact prompt generator to boost the performance of the VLM deployed across different farms, VLLFL preserves privacy while reducing communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that VLLFL achieves 14.53% improvement in the performance of VLM while reducing 99.3% communication overhead. Spanning tasks from identifying a wide variety of fruits to detecting harmful animals in agriculture, the proposed framework offers an efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving solution specifically tailored to agricultural applications.

- **[Chain-of-Thought Textual Reasoning for Few-shot Temporal Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13460)**  `arXiv:2504.13460`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Hongwei Ji, Wulian Yun, Mengshi Qi, Huadong Ma_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories. However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.

- **[Towards a Multi-Agent Vision-Language System for Zero-Shot Novel Hazardous Object Detection for Autonomous Driving Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13399)**  `arXiv:2504.13399`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  Detecting anomalous hazards in visual data, particularly in video streams, is a critical challenge in autonomous driving. Existing models often struggle with unpredictable, out-of-label hazards due to their reliance on predefined object categories. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates vision-language reasoning with zero-shot object detection to improve hazard identification and explanation. Our pipeline consists of a Vision-Language Model (VLM), a Large Language Model (LLM), in order to detect hazardous objects within a traffic scene. We refine object detection by incorporating OpenAI's CLIP model to match predicted hazards with bounding box annotations, improving localization accuracy. To assess model performance, we create a ground truth dataset by denoising and extending the foundational COOOL (Challenge-of-Out-of-Label) anomaly detection benchmark dataset with complete natural language descriptions for hazard annotations. We define a means of hazard detection and labeling evaluation on the extended dataset using cosine similarity. This evaluation considers the semantic similarity between the predicted hazard description and the annotated ground truth for each video. Additionally, we release a set of tools for structuring and managing large-scale hazard detection datasets. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of current vision-language-based approaches, offering insights into future improvements in autonomous hazard detection systems.

- **[WildFireCan-MMD: A Multimodal dataset for Classification of User-generated Content During Wildfires in Canada](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13231)**  `arXiv:2504.13231`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Braeden Sherritt, Isar Nejadgholi, Marzieh Amini_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rapid information access is vital during wildfires, yet traditional data sources are slow and costly. Social media offers real-time updates, but extracting relevant insights remains a challenge. We present WildFireCan-MMD, a new multimodal dataset of X posts from recent Canadian wildfires, annotated across 13 key themes. Evaluating both Vision Language Models and custom-trained classifiers, we show that while zero-shot prompting offers quick deployment, even simple trained models outperform them when labelled data is available, by up to 23%. Our findings highlight the enduring importance of tailored datasets and task-specific training. Importantly, such datasets should be localized, as disaster response requirements vary across regions and contexts.

- **[Mirror: Multimodal Cognitive Reframing Therapy for Rolling with Resistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13211)**  `arXiv:2504.13211`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) in psychotherapy; however, text-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) models often struggle with client resistance, which can weaken therapeutic alliance. To address this, we propose a multimodal approach that incorporates nonverbal cues, allowing the AI therapist to better align its responses with the client's negative emotional state. Specifically, we introduce a new synthetic dataset, Multimodal Interactive Rolling with Resistance (Mirror), which is a novel synthetic dataset that pairs client statements with corresponding facial images. Using this dataset, we train baseline Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that can analyze facial cues, infer emotions, and generate empathetic responses to effectively manage resistance. They are then evaluated in terms of both the therapist's counseling skills and the strength of the therapeutic alliance in the presence of client resistance. Our results demonstrate that Mirror significantly enhances the AI therapist's ability to handle resistance, which outperforms existing text-based CBT approaches.

- **[Analysing the Robustness of Vision-Language-Models to Common Corruptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13690)**  `arXiv:2504.13690`  `cs.CV`  
  _Muhammad Usama, Syeda Aisha Asim, Syed Bilal Ali, Syed Talal Wasim, Umair Bin Mansoor_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding and reasoning about visual and textual content. However, their robustness to common image corruptions remains under-explored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive analysis of VLM robustness across 19 corruption types from the ImageNet-C benchmark, spanning four categories: noise, blur, weather, and digital distortions. We introduce two new benchmarks, TextVQA-C and GQA-C, to systematically evaluate how corruptions affect scene text understanding and object-based reasoning, respectively. Our analysis reveals that transformer-based VLMs exhibit distinct vulnerability patterns across tasks: text recognition deteriorates most severely under blur and snow corruptions, while object reasoning shows higher sensitivity to corruptions such as frost and impulse noise. We connect these observations to the frequency-domain characteristics of different corruptions, revealing how transformers' inherent bias toward low-frequency processing explains their differential robustness patterns. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more corruption-robust vision-language models for real-world applications.

  Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) demonstrate significant potential in healthcare, but their reliance on general medical data and coarse-grained global visual understanding limits them in intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis. Currently, intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis faces three major challenges: (i) Data. The lack of deeply annotated, high-quality, multi-modal ophthalmic visual instruction data; (ii) Benchmark. The absence of a comprehensive and systematic benchmark for evaluating diagnostic performance; (iii) Model. The difficulty of adapting holistic visual architectures to fine-grained, region-specific ophthalmic lesion identification. In this paper, we propose the Eyecare Kit, which systematically tackles the aforementioned three key challenges with the tailored dataset, benchmark and model: First, we construct a multi-agent data engine with real-life ophthalmology data to produce Eyecare-100K, a high-quality ophthalmic visual instruction dataset. Subsequently, we design Eyecare-Bench, a benchmark that comprehensively evaluates the overall performance of LVLMs on intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis tasks across multiple dimensions. Finally, we develop the EyecareGPT, optimized for fine-grained ophthalmic visual understanding thoroughly, which incorporates an adaptive resolution mechanism and a layer-wise dense connector. Extensive experimental results indicate that the EyecareGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in a range of ophthalmic tasks, underscoring its significant potential for the advancement of open research in intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis.

- **[Early Timestep Zero-Shot Candidate Selection for Instruction-Guided Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13490)**  `arXiv:2504.13490`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite recent advances in diffusion models, achieving reliable image generation and editing remains challenging due to the inherent diversity induced by stochastic noise in the sampling process. Instruction-guided image editing with diffusion models offers user-friendly capabilities, yet editing failures, such as background distortion, frequently occur. Users often resort to trial and error, adjusting seeds or prompts to achieve satisfactory results, which is inefficient. While seed selection methods exist for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, they depend on external verifiers, limiting applicability, and evaluating multiple seeds increases computational complexity. To address this, we first establish a multiple-seed-based image editing baseline using background consistency scores, achieving Best-of-N performance without supervision. Building on this, we introduce ELECT (Early-timestep Latent Evaluation for Candidate Selection), a zero-shot framework that selects reliable seeds by estimating background mismatches at early diffusion timesteps, identifying the seed that retains the background while modifying only the foreground. ELECT ranks seed candidates by a background inconsistency score, filtering unsuitable samples early based on background consistency while preserving editability. Beyond standalone seed selection, ELECT integrates into instruction-guided editing pipelines and extends to Multimodal Large-Language Models (MLLMs) for joint seed and prompt selection, further improving results when seed selection alone is insufficient. Experiments show that ELECT reduces computational costs (by 41 percent on average and up to 61 percent) while improving background consistency and instruction adherence, achieving around 40 percent success rates in previously failed cases - without any external supervision or training.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in video generation have been driven by diffusion models and autoregressive frameworks, yet critical challenges persist in harmonizing prompt adherence, visual quality, motion dynamics, and duration: compromises in motion dynamics to enhance temporal visual quality, constrained video duration (5-10 seconds) to prioritize resolution, and inadequate shot-aware generation stemming from general-purpose MLLMs' inability to interpret cinematic grammar, such as shot composition, actor expressions, and camera motions. These intertwined limitations hinder realistic long-form synthesis and professional film-style generation. To address these limitations, we propose SkyReels-V2, an Infinite-length Film Generative Model, that synergizes Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), Multi-stage Pretraining, Reinforcement Learning, and Diffusion Forcing Framework. Firstly, we design a comprehensive structural representation of video that combines the general descriptions by the Multi-modal LLM and the detailed shot language by sub-expert models. Aided with human annotation, we then train a unified Video Captioner, named SkyCaptioner-V1, to efficiently label the video data. Secondly, we establish progressive-resolution pretraining for the fundamental video generation, followed by a four-stage post-training enhancement: Initial concept-balanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) improves baseline quality; Motion-specific Reinforcement Learning (RL) training with human-annotated and synthetic distortion data addresses dynamic artifacts; Our diffusion forcing framework with non-decreasing noise schedules enables long-video synthesis in an efficient search space; Final high-quality SFT refines visual fidelity.

- **[GaGA: Towards Interactive Global Geolocation Assistant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08907)**  `arXiv:2412.08907`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Global geolocation, which seeks to predict the geographical location of images captured anywhere in the world, is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of computer vision. In this paper, we introduce an innovative interactive global geolocation assistant named GaGA, built upon the flourishing large vision-language models (LVLMs). GaGA uncovers geographical clues within images and combines them with the extensive world knowledge embedded in LVLMs to determine the geolocations while also providing justifications and explanations for the prediction results. We further designed a novel interactive geolocation method that surpasses traditional static inference approaches. It allows users to intervene, correct, or provide clues for the predictions, making the model more flexible and practical. The development of GaGA relies on the newly proposed Multi-modal Global Geolocation (MG-Geo) dataset, a comprehensive collection of 5 million high-quality image-text pairs. GaGA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GWS15k dataset, improving accuracy by 4.57% at the country level and 2.92% at the city level, setting a new benchmark. These advancements represent a significant leap forward in developing highly accurate, interactive geolocation systems with global applicability.

- **[DialogGen: Multi-modal Interactive Dialogue System for Multi-turn Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08857)**  `arXiv:2403.08857`  `cs.CV`  
  _Minbin Huang, Yanxin Long, Xinchi Deng, Ruihang Chu, Jiangfeng Xiong, Xiaodan Liang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have significantly advanced in recent years. However, effective interaction with these models is challenging for average users due to the need for specialized prompt engineering knowledge and the inability to perform multi-turn image generation, hindering a dynamic and iterative creation process. Recent attempts have tried to equip Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with T2I models to bring the user's natural language instructions into reality. Hence, the output modality of MLLMs is extended, and the multi-turn generation quality of T2I models is enhanced thanks to the strong multi-modal comprehension ability of MLLMs. However, many of these works face challenges in identifying correct output modalities and generating coherent images accordingly as the number of output modalities increases and the conversations go deeper. Therefore, we propose DialogGen, an effective pipeline to align off-the-shelf MLLMs and T2I models to build a Multi-modal Interactive Dialogue System (MIDS) for multi-turn Text-to-Image generation. It is composed of drawing prompt alignment, careful training data curation, and error correction. Moreover, as the field of MIDS flourishes, comprehensive benchmarks are urgently needed to evaluate MIDS fairly in terms of output modality correctness and multi-modal output coherence. To address this issue, we introduce the Multi-modal Dialogue Benchmark (DialogBen), a comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to assess the ability of MLLMs to generate accurate and coherent multi-modal content that supports image editing. It contains two evaluation metrics to measure the model's ability to switch modalities and the coherence of the output images. Our extensive experiments on DialogBen and user study demonstrate the effectiveness of DialogGen compared with other State-of-the-Art models.

- **[The Mirage of Performance Gains: Why Contrastive Decoding Fails to Address Multimodal Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10020)**  `arXiv:2504.10020`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Hao Yin, Guangzong Si, Zilei Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to reduce hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). These methods work by constructing contrastive samples to induce hallucinations and then suppressing them in the output distribution. However, this paper demonstrates that such approaches fail to effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. The performance improvements observed on POPE Benchmark are largely driven by two misleading factors: (1) crude, unidirectional adjustments to the model's output distribution and (2) the adaptive plausibility constraint, which reduces the sampling strategy to greedy search. To further illustrate these issues, we introduce a series of spurious improvement methods and evaluate their performance against contrastive decoding techniques. Experimental results reveal that the observed performance gains in contrastive decoding are entirely unrelated to its intended goal of mitigating hallucinations. Our findings challenge common assumptions about the effectiveness of contrastive decoding strategies and pave the way for developing genuinely effective solutions to hallucinations in MLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generation capabilities and language coverage of multilingual large language models (mLLMs) are advancing rapidly. However, evaluation practices for generative abilities of mLLMs are still lacking comprehensiveness, scientific rigor, and consistent adoption across research labs, which undermines their potential to meaningfully guide mLLM development. We draw parallels with machine translation (MT) evaluation, a field that faced similar challenges and has, over decades, developed transparent reporting standards and reliable evaluations for multilingual generative models. Through targeted experiments across key stages of the generative evaluation pipeline, we demonstrate how best practices from MT evaluation can deepen the understanding of quality differences between models. Additionally, we identify essential components for robust meta-evaluation of mLLMs, ensuring the evaluation methods themselves are rigorously assessed. We distill these insights into a checklist of actionable recommendations for mLLM research and development.
