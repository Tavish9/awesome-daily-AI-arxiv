- **[Object Navigation with Structure-Semantic Reasoning-Based Multi-level Map and Multimodal Decision-Making LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05896)**  `arXiv:2506.05896`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of 28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.

  Adaptive navigation in unfamiliar environments is crucial for household service robots but remains challenging due to the need for both low-level path planning and high-level scene understanding. While recent vision-language model (VLM) based zero-shot approaches reduce dependence on prior maps and scene-specific training data, they face significant limitations: spatiotemporal discontinuity from discrete observations, unstructured memory representations, and insufficient task understanding leading to navigation failures. We propose DORAEMON (Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory Oriented Navigation), a novel cognitive-inspired framework consisting of Ventral and Dorsal Streams that mimics human navigation capabilities. The Dorsal Stream implements the Hierarchical Semantic-Spatial Fusion and Topology Map to handle spatiotemporal discontinuities, while the Ventral Stream combines RAG-VLM and Policy-VLM to improve decision-making. Our approach also develops Nav-Ensurance to ensure navigation safety and efficiency. We evaluate DORAEMON on the HM3D, MP3D, and GOAT datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on both success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL) metrics, significantly outperforming existing methods. We also introduce a new evaluation metric (AORI) to assess navigation intelligence better. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DORAEMON's effectiveness in zero-shot autonomous navigation without requiring prior map building or pre-training.

- **[RoboOS: A Hierarchical Embodied Framework for Cross-Embodiment and Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03673)**  `arXiv:2505.03673`  `cs.RO`  
  _Huajie Tan, Xiaoshuai Hao, Cheng Chi, Minglan Lin, Yaoxu Lyu, Mingyu Cao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The dawn of embodied intelligence has ushered in an unprecedented imperative for resilient, cognition-enabled multi-agent collaboration across next-generation ecosystems, revolutionizing paradigms in autonomous manufacturing, adaptive service robotics, and cyber-physical production architectures. However, current robotic systems face significant limitations, such as limited cross-embodiment adaptability, inefficient task scheduling, and insufficient dynamic error correction. While End-to-end VLA models demonstrate inadequate long-horizon planning and task generalization, hierarchical VLA models suffer from a lack of cross-embodiment and multi-agent coordination capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce RoboOS, the first open-source embodied system built on a Brain-Cerebellum hierarchical architecture, enabling a paradigm shift from single-agent to multi-agent intelligence. Specifically, RoboOS consists of three key components: (1) Embodied Brain Model (RoboBrain), a MLLM designed for global perception and high-level decision-making; (2) Cerebellum Skill Library, a modular, plug-and-play toolkit that facilitates seamless execution of multiple skills; and (3) Real-Time Shared Memory, a spatiotemporal synchronization mechanism for coordinating multi-agent states. By integrating hierarchical information flow, RoboOS bridges Embodied Brain and Cerebellum Skill Library, facilitating robust planning, scheduling, and error correction for long-horizon tasks, while ensuring efficient multi-agent collaboration through Real-Time Shared Memory. Furthermore, we enhance edge-cloud communication and cloud-based distributed inference to facilitate high-frequency interactions and enable scalable deployment. Extensive real-world experiments across various scenarios, demonstrate RoboOS's versatility in supporting heterogeneous embodiments. Project website:this https URL

  We present Heartcare Suite, a multimodal comprehensive framework for finegrained electrocardiogram (ECG) understanding. It comprises three key components: (i) Heartcare-220K, a high-quality, structured, and comprehensive multimodal ECG dataset covering essential tasks such as disease diagnosis, waveform morphology analysis, and rhythm interpretation. (ii) Heartcare-Bench, a systematic and multi-dimensional benchmark designed to evaluate diagnostic intelligence and guide the optimization of Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) in ECG scenarios. and (iii) HeartcareGPT with a tailored tokenizer Bidirectional ECG Abstract Tokenization (Beat), which compresses raw multi-lead signals into semantically rich discrete tokens via duallevel vector quantization and query-guided bidirectional diffusion mechanism. Built upon Heartcare-220K, HeartcareGPT achieves strong generalization and SoTA performance across multiple clinically meaningful tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Heartcare Suite is highly effective in advancing ECGspecific multimodal understanding and evaluation. Our project is available atthis https URL.

- **[Movie Facts and Fibs (MF$^2$): A Benchmark for Long Movie Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06275)**  `arXiv:2506.06275`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Emmanouil Zaranis, Ant√≥nio Farinhas, Saul Santos, Beatriz Canaverde, Miguel Moura Ramos, Aditya K Surikuchi, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge, partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral, ``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length, open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs -- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs. These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

  Visual captioning benchmarks have become outdated with the emergence of modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as the brief ground-truth sentences and traditional metrics fail to assess detailed captions effectively. While recent benchmarks attempt to address this by focusing on keyword extraction or object-centric evaluation, they remain limited to vague-view or object-view analyses and incomplete visual element coverage. In this paper, we introduce CAPability, a comprehensive multi-view benchmark for evaluating visual captioning across 12 dimensions spanning six critical views. We curate nearly 11K human-annotated images and videos with visual element annotations to evaluate the generated captions. CAPability stably assesses both the correctness and thoroughness of captions with \textit{precision} and \textit{hit} metrics. By converting annotations to QA pairs, we further introduce a heuristic metric, \textit{know but cannot tell} ($K\bar{T}$), indicating a significant performance gap between QA and caption capabilities. Our work provides a holistic analysis of MLLMs' captioning abilities, as we identify their strengths and weaknesses across various dimensions, guiding future research to enhance specific aspects of their capabilities.

- **[Do Large Vision-Language Models Distinguish between the Actual and Apparent Features of Illusions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05765)**  `arXiv:2506.05765`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Taiga Shinozaki, Tomoki Doi, Satoshi Nishida, Hitomi Yanaka_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions. However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types, they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available atthis https URL

- **[Can Vision Language Models Infer Human Gaze Direction? A Controlled Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05412)**  `arXiv:2506.05412`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Zory Zhang, Pinyuan Feng, Bingyang Wang, Tianwei Zhao, Suyang Yu, Qingying Gao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65), and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111 VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential remains.

- **[Leopard: A Vision Language Model For Text-Rich Multi-Image Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01744)**  `arXiv:2410.01744`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Mengzhao Jia, Wenhao Yu, Kaixin Ma, Tianqing Fang, Zhihan Zhang, Siru Ouyang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-rich images, where text serves as the central visual element guiding the overall understanding, are prevalent in real-world applications, such as presentation slides, scanned documents, and webpage snapshots. Tasks involving multiple text-rich images are especially challenging, as they require not only understanding the content of individual images but reasoning about inter-relationships and logical flows across multiple visual inputs. Despite the importance of these scenarios, current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to handle such tasks due to two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality instruction tuning datasets for text-rich multi-image scenarios, and (2) the difficulty in balancing image resolution with visual feature sequence length. To address these challenges, we propose Leopard, an MLLM tailored for handling vision-language tasks involving multiple text-rich images. First, we curated about one million high-quality multimodal instruction-tuning data, tailored to text-rich, multi-image scenarios. Second, we proposed an adaptive high-resolution multi-image encoding module to dynamically optimize the allocation of visual sequence length based on the original aspect ratios and resolutions of images. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks reveal that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems, such as Llama-3.2 and Qwen2-VL, in challenging text-rich, multi-image evaluations. Remarkably, our approach achieves outstanding performance using only 1.2M training instances, all of which are fully open-sourced, demonstrating both high efficiency and effectiveness compared to models trained on large-scale in-house data.

- **[Sparse Autoencoders Learn Monosemantic Features in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02821)**  `arXiv:2504.02821`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Given that interpretability and steerability are crucial to AI safety, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a tool to enhance them in Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we extend the application of SAEs to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, and introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating monosemanticity at the neuron-level in vision representations. To ensure that our evaluation aligns with human perception, we propose a benchmark derived from a large-scale user study. Our experimental results reveal that SAEs trained on VLMs significantly enhance the monosemanticity of individual neurons, with sparsity and wide latents being the most influential factors. Notably, we demonstrate that applying SAE interventions on CLIP's vision encoder directly steers multimodal LLM outputs (e.g., LLaVA), without any modifications to the underlying model. These findings emphasize the practicality and efficacy of SAEs as an unsupervised tool for enhancing both interpretability and control of VLMs. Code is available atthis https URL.

- **[LlavaGuard: An Open VLM-based Framework for Safeguarding Vision Datasets and Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05113)**  `arXiv:2406.05113`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Lukas Helff, Felix Friedrich, Manuel Brack, Kristian Kersting, Patrick Schramowski_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces LlavaGuard, a suite of VLM-based vision safeguards that address the critical need for reliable guardrails in the era of large-scale data and models. To this end, we establish a novel open framework, describing a customizable safety taxonomy, data preprocessing, augmentation, and training setup. For teaching a VLM safeguard on safety, we further create a multimodal safety dataset with high-quality human expert annotations, where each image is labeled with a safety rating, category, and rationale. We also employ advanced augmentations to support context-specific assessments. The resulting LlavaGuard models, ranging from 0.5B to 7B, serve as a versatile tool for evaluating the safety compliance of visual content against flexible policies. In comprehensive experiments, LlavaGuard outperforms both state-of-the-art safeguards and VLMs in accuracy and in flexibly handling different policies. Additionally, we demonstrate LlavaGuard's performance in two real-world applications: large-scale dataset annotation and moderation of text-to-image models. We make our entire framework, including the dataset, model weights, and training code.

  Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve: its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems -- including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset, generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent, reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However, such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception, reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology, inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant. This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities.

- **[LLMs Can Compensate for Deficiencies in Visual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05439)**  `arXiv:2506.05439`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Sho Takishita, Jay Gala, Abdelrahman Mohamed, Kentaro Inui, Yova Kementchedjhieva_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language decoder.

- **[GenIR: Generative Visual Feedback for Mental Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06220)**  `arXiv:2506.06220`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Diji Yang, Minghao Liu, Chung-Hsiang Lo, Yi Zhang, James Davis_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind, that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation for future research in this direction.

  We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck" without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2) multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and (3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025 Waymo Vision-based End-to-End (E2E) Driving Challenge and surpassing the public baseline by 2.77%.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from 2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3% without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However, troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with 0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20% accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally, ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g., weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.

  The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR), and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and 8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube, covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI. The dataset and code are available atthis https URL.

- **[AD-EE: Early Exiting for Fast and Reliable Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05404)**  `arXiv:2506.05404`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE, an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy, with maximum gains of up to 44%.

  Unified multimodal understanding and generation have recently received much attention in the area of vision and language. Existing UniMs are designed to simultaneously learn both multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, demanding substantial computational resources, and often struggle to generate interleaved text-image. We present ARMOR, a resource-efficient and pure autoregressive framework that achieves both understanding and generation by fine-tuning existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, ARMOR extends existing MLLMs from three perspectives: (1) For model architecture, an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture with a forward-switching mechanism is introduced to unify embedding space integrating textual and visual modalities for enabling natural text-image interleaved generation with minimal computational overhead. (2) For training data, a meticulously curated, high-quality interleaved dataset is collected for fine-tuning MLLMs. (3) For the training algorithm, we propose a ``what or how to generate'' algorithm to empower existing MLLMs with multimodal generation capabilities while preserving their multimodal understanding capabilities, through three progressive training stages based on the collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ARMOR upgrades existing MLLMs to UniMs with promising image generation capabilities, using limited training resources. Our code will be released soon atthis https URL.

  Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations, we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering, demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM architectures.

  We present ExAct, a new video-language benchmark for expert-level understanding of skilled physical human activities. Our new benchmark contains 3521 expert-curated video question-answer pairs spanning 11 physical activities in 6 domains: Sports, Bike Repair, Cooking, Health, Music, and Dance. ExAct requires the correct answer to be selected from five carefully designed candidate options, thus necessitating a nuanced, fine-grained, expert-level understanding of physical human skills. Evaluating the recent state-of-the-art VLMs on ExAct reveals a substantial performance gap relative to human expert performance. Specifically, the best-performing GPT-4o model achieves only 44.70% accuracy, well below the 82.02% attained by trained human specialists/experts. We believe that ExAct will be beneficial for developing and evaluating VLMs capable of precise understanding of human skills in various physical and procedural domains.

  While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions: (1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3) How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context? Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

  We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.

  The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos, while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human. Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm. Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema, outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with 7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield. Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology; (2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements. Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained at large scale have shown unprecedented transferability capabilities and are being progressively integrated into medical image analysis. Although its discriminative potential has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP, and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.

  As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and code are available online.

  Effectively representing 3D scenes for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is crucial yet challenging. Existing approaches commonly only rely on 2D image features and use varied tokenization approaches. This work presents a rigorous study of 3D token structures, systematically comparing video-based and point-based representations while maintaining consistent model backbones and parameters. We propose a novel approach that enriches visual tokens by incorporating 3D point cloud features from a Sonata pretrained Point Transformer V3 encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that merging explicit 3D features significantly boosts performance. Furthermore, we show that point-based token structures can rival video-based ones when the points are cleverly sampled and ordered. Our best models from both structures achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. We emphasize our analysis of token structures as a key contribution, alongside transparent reporting of results averaged over multiple seeds, a practice we believe is vital for robust progress in the field.

  Image degradation is a prevalent issue in various real-world applications, affecting visual quality and downstream processing tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework that employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to automatically classify degraded images into predefined categories. The VLM categorizes an input image into one of four degradation types: (A) super-resolution degradation (including noise, blur, and JPEG compression), (B) reflection artifacts, (C) motion blur, or (D) no visible degradation (high-quality image). Once classified, images assigned to categories A, B, or C undergo targeted restoration using dedicated models tailored for each specific degradation type. The final output is a restored image with improved visual quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately classifying image degradations and enhancing image quality through specialized restoration models. Our method presents a scalable and automated solution for real-world image enhancement tasks, leveraging the capabilities of VLMs in conjunction with state-of-the-art restoration techniques.

  In robot scientific laboratories, visual anomaly detection is important for the timely identification and resolution of potential faults or deviations. It has become a key factor in ensuring the stability and safety of experimental processes. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VLM-based visual reasoning approach that supports different levels of supervision through four progressively informative prompt configurations. To systematically evaluate its effectiveness, we construct a visual benchmark tailored for process anomaly detection in scientific workflows. Experiments on two representative vision-language models show that detection accuracy improves as more contextual information is provided, confirming the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed reasoning approach for process anomaly detection in scientific workflows. Furthermore, real-world validations at selected experimental steps confirm that first-person visual observation can effectively identify process-level anomalies. This work provides both a data-driven foundation and an evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific experiment workflows.

  Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures, allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.

  We introduce SeedEdit 3.0, in companion with our T2I model Seedream 3.0, which significantly improves over our previous SeedEdit versions in both aspects of edit instruction following and image content (e.g., ID/IP) preservation on real image inputs. Additional to model upgrading with T2I, in this report, we present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for computing a diffusion loss and reward losses. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0 on our testing benchmarks, for real/synthetic image editing, where it achieves a best trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%, compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

  Humans can intuitively compose and arrange scenes in the 3D space for photography. However, can advanced AI image generators plan scenes with similar 3D spatial awareness when creating images from text or image prompts? We present GenSpace, a novel benchmark and evaluation pipeline to comprehensively assess the spatial awareness of current image generation models. Furthermore, standard evaluations using general Vision-Language Models (VLMs) frequently fail to capture the detailed spatial errors. To handle this challenge, we propose a specialized evaluation pipeline and metric, which reconstructs 3D scene geometry using multiple visual foundation models and provides a more accurate and human-aligned metric of spatial faithfulness. Our findings show that while AI models create visually appealing images and can follow general instructions, they struggle with specific 3D details like object placement, relationships, and measurements. We summarize three core limitations in the spatial perception of current state-of-the-art image generation models: 1) Object Perspective Understanding, 2) Egocentric-Allocentric Transformation and 3) Metric Measurement Adherence, highlighting possible directions for improving spatial intelligence in image generation.

  Visual text is a crucial component in both document and scene images, conveying rich semantic information and attracting significant attention in the computer vision community. Beyond traditional tasks such as text detection and recognition, visual text processing has witnessed rapid advancements driven by the emergence of foundation models, including text image reconstruction and text image manipulation. Despite significant progress, challenges remain due to the unique properties that differentiate text from general objects. Effectively capturing and leveraging these distinct textual characteristics is essential for developing robust visual text processing models. In this survey, we present a comprehensive, multi-perspective analysis of recent advancements in visual text processing, focusing on two key questions: (1) What textual features are most suitable for different visual text processing tasks? (2) How can these distinctive text features be effectively incorporated into processing frameworks? Furthermore, we introduce VTPBench, a new benchmark that encompasses a broad range of visual text processing datasets. Leveraging the advanced visual quality assessment capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we propose VTPScore, a novel evaluation metric designed to ensure fair and reliable evaluation. Our empirical study with more than 20 specific models reveals substantial room for improvement in the current techniques. Our aim is to establish this work as a fundamental resource that fosters future exploration and innovation in the dynamic field of visual text processing.

  Self-supervised 3D occupancy prediction offers a promising solution for understanding complex driving scenes without requiring costly 3D annotations. However, training dense occupancy decoders to capture fine-grained geometry and semantics can demand hundreds of GPU hours, and once trained, such models struggle to adapt to varying voxel resolutions or novel object categories without extensive retraining. To overcome these limitations, we propose a practical and flexible test-time occupancy prediction framework termed TT-Occ. Our method incrementally constructs, optimizes and voxelizes time-aware 3D Gaussians from raw sensor streams by integrating vision foundation models (VLMs) at runtime. The flexible nature of 3D Gaussians allows voxelization at arbitrary user-specified resolutions, while the generalization ability of VLMs enables accurate perception and open-vocabulary recognition, without any network training or fine-tuning. Specifically, TT-Occ operates in a lift-track-voxelize symphony: We first lift the geometry and semantics of surrounding-view extracted from VLMs to instantiate Gaussians at 3D space; Next, we track dynamic Gaussians while accumulating static ones to complete the scene and enforce temporal consistency; Finally, we voxelize the optimized Gaussians to generate occupancy prediction. Optionally, inherent noise in VLM predictions and tracking is mitigated by periodically smoothing neighboring Gaussians during optimization. To validate the generality and effectiveness of our framework, we offer two variants: one LiDAR-based and one vision-centric, and conduct extensive experiments on Occ3D and nuCraft benchmarks with varying voxel resolutions.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. However, separate training of visual and textual encoders often results in a misalignment of the modality. Such misalignment may lead models to generate content that is absent from the input image, a phenomenon referred to as hallucination. These inaccuracies severely undermine the trustworthiness of MLLMs in real-world applications. Despite attempts to optimize text preferences to mitigate this issue, our initial investigation indicates that the trustworthiness of MLLMs remains inadequate. Specifically, these models tend to provide preferred answers even when the input image is heavily distorted. Analysis of visual token attention also indicates that the model focuses primarily on the surrounding context rather than the key object referenced in the question. These findings highlight a misalignment between the modalities, where answers inadequately leverage input images. Motivated by our findings, we propose Modality-Fair Preference Optimization (MFPO), which comprises three components: the construction of a multimodal preference dataset in which dispreferred images differ from originals solely in key regions; an image reward loss function encouraging the model to generate answers better aligned with the input images; and an easy-to-hard iterative alignment strategy to stabilize joint modality training. Extensive experiments on three trustworthiness benchmarks demonstrate that MFPO significantly enhances the trustworthiness of MLLMs. In particular, it enables the 7B models to attain trustworthiness levels on par with, or even surpass, those of the 13B, 34B, and larger models.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks. Despite great success, recent studies show that LVLMs encounter substantial limitations when engaging with visual graphs. To study the reason behind these limitations, we propose VGCure, a comprehensive benchmark covering 22 tasks for examining the fundamental graph understanding and reasoning capacities of LVLMs. Extensive evaluations conducted on 14 LVLMs reveal that LVLMs are weak in basic graph understanding and reasoning tasks, particularly those concerning relational or structurally complex information. Based on this observation, we propose a structure-aware fine-tuning framework to enhance LVLMs with structure learning abilities through three self-supervised learning tasks. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LVLMs' performance on fundamental and downstream graph learning tasks, as well as enhancing their robustness against complex visual graphs.

  Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL, a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

  Numerous theorems, such as those in geometry, are often presented in multimodal forms (e.g., diagrams). Humans benefit from visual reasoning in such settings, using diagrams to gain intuition and guide the proof process. Modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving a wide range of mathematical problems. However, the potential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the multimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal, Multi-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this role as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056 multimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level mathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in Lean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide range of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate sophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of mathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal proofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language models. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH problems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research on automated theorem proving.

GuessBench sources data from "Guess the Build", an online multiplayer Minecraft minigame where one player constructs a Minecraft build given a concept (e.g. caterpillar) and others try to guess it with natural language hints, presenting a pristine testbed for sensemaking creativity in the wild with VLMs acting as guessers. We curate 1500 images from the actual gameplay and design 2000 problems spanning static and dynamic image settings, natural language hints of varying completeness, and more. Extensive experiments with six open/API VLMs and five reasoning enhancement approaches demonstrate that GuessBench presents a uniquely challenging task in creativity modeling: even the start-of-the-art GPT-4o is incorrect on 34% of instances, while we observe a huge performance gap (13.87% vs. 53.93% on average) between open and API models. When used as a resource to improve VLMs, fine-tuning on the reasoning traces for GuessBench problems improves visual perception tasks by 15.36% on average. Further analysis reveals that VLM performance in creativity sensemaking correlates with the frequency of the concept in training data, while the accuracy drops sharply for concepts in underrepresented cultural contexts and low-resource languages.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on extensive datasets can inadvertently learn biases by correlating gender information with specific objects or scenarios. Current methods, which focus on modifying inputs and monitoring changes in the model's output probability scores, often struggle to comprehensively understand bias from the perspective of model components. We propose a framework that incorporates causal mediation analysis to measure and map the pathways of bias generation and propagation within VLMs. This approach allows us to identify the direct effects of interventions on model bias and the indirect effects of interventions on bias mediated through different model components. Our results show that image features are the primary contributors to bias, with significantly higher impacts than text features, specifically accounting for 32.57% and 12.63% of the bias in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively. Notably, the image encoder's contribution surpasses that of the text encoder and the deep fusion encoder. Further experimentation confirms that contributions from both language and vision modalities are aligned and non-conflicting. Consequently, focusing on blurring gender representations within the image encoder, which contributes most to the model bias, reduces bias efficiently by 22.03% and 9.04% in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively, with minimal performance loss or increased computational demands.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress in reasoning capabilities, such as DeepSeek-R1, which leverages rule-based reinforcement learning to enhance logical reasoning significantly. However, extending these achievements to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect reasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework Infi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a curriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal reasoning model Infi-MMR-3B. The first phase, Foundational Reasoning Activation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and strengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase, Cross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to facilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts. The third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated, caption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust cross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal math reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision test, and 21.33% on OlympiadBench) and general reasoning ability (67.2% on MathVista testmini).

  In this work, we identify the "2D-Cheating" problem in 3D LLM evaluation, where these tasks might be easily solved by VLMs with rendered images of point clouds, exposing ineffective evaluation of 3D LLMs' unique 3D capabilities. We test VLM performance across multiple 3D LLM benchmarks and, using this as a reference, propose principles for better assessing genuine 3D understanding. We also advocate explicitly separating 3D abilities from 1D or 2D aspects when evaluating 3D LLMs. Code and data are available atthis https URL

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in document understanding, a rapidly growing research area with significant industrial demand. As a multimodal task, document understanding requires models to possess both perceptual and cognitive abilities. However, due to different types of annotation noise in training, current MLLMs often face conflicts between perception and cognition. Taking a document VQA task (cognition) as an example, an MLLM might generate answers that do not match the corresponding visual content identified by its OCR (perception). This conflict suggests that the MLLM might struggle to establish an intrinsic connection between the information it "sees" and what it "understands". Such conflicts challenge the intuitive notion that cognition is consistent with perception, hindering the performance and explainability of MLLMs. In this paper, we define the conflicts between cognition and perception as Cognition and Perception (C&P) knowledge conflicts, a form of multimodal knowledge conflict, and systematically assess them with a focus on document understanding. Our analysis reveals that even GPT-4o, a leading MLLM, achieves only 75.26% C&P consistency. To mitigate the C&P knowledge conflicts, we propose a novel method called Multimodal Knowledge Consistency Fine-tuning. Our method reduces C&P knowledge conflicts across all tested MLLMs and enhances their performance in both cognitive and perceptual tasks. All data we construct will be publicly available.
