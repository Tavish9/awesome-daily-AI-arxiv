  This paper addresses the inherent inference latency challenges associated with deploying multimodal large language models (MLLM) in quadruped vision-language-action (QUAR-VLA) tasks. Our investigation reveals that conventional parameter reduction techniques ultimately impair the performance of the language foundation model during the action instruction tuning phase, making them unsuitable for this purpose. We introduce a novel latency-free quadruped MLLM model, dubbed QUART-Online, designed to enhance inference efficiency without degrading the performance of the language foundation model. By incorporating Action Chunk Discretization (ACD), we compress the original action representation space, mapping continuous action values onto a smaller set of discrete representative vectors while preserving critical information. Subsequently, we fine-tune the MLLM to integrate vision, language, and compressed actions into a unified semantic space. Experimental results demonstrate that QUART-Online operates in tandem with the existing MLLM system, achieving real-time inference in sync with the underlying controller frequency, significantly boosting the success rate across various tasks by 65%.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language-conditioned policies have recently gained substantial adoption in robotics as they allow users to specify tasks using natural language, making them highly versatile. While much research has focused on improving the action prediction of language-conditioned policies, reasoning about task descriptions has been largely overlooked. Ambiguous task descriptions often lead to downstream policy failures due to misinterpretation by the robotic agent. To address this challenge, we introduce AmbResVLM, a novel method that grounds language goals in the observed scene and explicitly reasons about task ambiguity. We extensively evaluate its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world domains, demonstrating superior task ambiguity detection and resolution compared to recent state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, real robot experiments show that our model improves the performance of downstream robot policies, increasing the average success rate from 69.6% to 97.1%. We make the data, code, and trained models publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[Keyframe-oriented Vision Token Pruning: Enhancing Efficiency of Large Vision Language Models on Long-Form Video Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10742)**  `arXiv:2503.10742`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in jointly processing visual and textual data. However, they often incur substantial computational overhead due to redundant visual information, particularly in long-form video scenarios. Existing approaches predominantly focus on either vision token pruning, which may overlook spatio-temporal dependencies, or keyframe selection, which identifies informative frames but discards others, thus disrupting contextual continuity. In this work, we propose KVTP (Keyframe-oriented Vision Token Pruning), a novel framework that overcomes the drawbacks of token pruning and keyframe selection. By adaptively assigning pruning rates based on frame relevance to the query, KVTP effectively retains essential contextual information while significantly reducing redundant computation. To thoroughly evaluate the long-form video understanding capacities of VLMs, we curated and reorganized subsets from VideoMME, EgoSchema, and NextQA into a unified benchmark named SparseKV-QA that highlights real-world scenarios with sparse but crucial events. Our experiments with VLMs of various scales show that KVTP can reduce token usage by 80% without compromising spatiotemporal and contextual consistency, significantly cutting computation while maintaining the performance. These results demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in efficient long-video processing, facilitating more scalable VLM deployment.

- **[TimeSoccer: An End-to-End Multimodal Large Language Model for Soccer Commentary Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17365)**  `arXiv:2504.17365`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Soccer is a globally popular sporting event, typically characterized by long matches and distinctive highlight moments. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities in temporal grounding and video understanding, soccer commentary generation often requires precise temporal localization and semantically rich descriptions over long-form video. However, existing soccer MLLMs often rely on the temporal a priori for caption generation, so they cannot process the soccer video end-to-end. While some traditional approaches follow a two-step paradigm that is complex and fails to capture the global context to achieve suboptimal performance. To solve the above issues, we present TimeSoccer, the first end-to-end soccer MLLM for Single-anchor Dense Video Captioning (SDVC) in full-match soccer videos. TimeSoccer jointly predicts timestamps and generates captions in a single pass, enabling global context modeling across 45-minute matches. To support long video understanding of soccer matches, we introduce MoFA-Select, a training-free, motion-aware frame compression module that adaptively selects representative frames via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and incorporates complementary training paradigms to strengthen the model's ability to handle long temporal sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TimeSoccer achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on the SDVC task in an end-to-end form, generating high-quality commentary with accurate temporal alignment and strong semantic relevance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents the technical solution proposed by Huawei Translation Service Center (HW-TSC) for the "End-to-End Document Image Machine Translation for Complex Layouts" competition at the 19th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (DIMT25@ICDAR2025). Leveraging state-of-the-art open-source large vision-language model (LVLM), we introduce a training framework that combines multi-task learning with perceptual chain-of-thought to develop a comprehensive end-to-end document translation system. During the inference phase, we apply minimum Bayesian decoding and post-processing strategies to further enhance the system's translation capabilities. Our solution uniquely addresses both OCR-based and OCR-free document image translation tasks within a unified framework. This paper systematically details the training methods, inference strategies, LVLM base models, training data, experimental setups, and results, demonstrating an effective approach to document image machine translation.

- **[DyMU: Dynamic Merging and Virtual Unmerging for Efficient VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17040)**  `arXiv:2504.17040`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhenhailong Wang, Senthil Purushwalkam, Caiming Xiong, Silvio Savarese, Heng Ji, Ran Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present DyMU, an efficient, training-free framework that dynamically reduces the computational burden of vision-language models (VLMs) while maintaining high task performance. Our approach comprises two key components. First, Dynamic Token Merging (DToMe) reduces the number of visual token embeddings by merging similar tokens based on image complexity, addressing the inherent inefficiency of fixed-length outputs in vision transformers. Second, Virtual Token Unmerging (VTU) simulates the expected token sequence for large language models (LLMs) by efficiently reconstructing the attention dynamics of a full sequence, thus preserving the downstream performance without additional fine-tuning. Unlike previous approaches, our method dynamically adapts token compression to the content of the image and operates completely training-free, making it readily applicable to most state-of-the-art VLM architectures. Extensive experiments on image and video understanding tasks demonstrate that DyMU can reduce the average visual token count by 32%-85% while achieving comparable performance to full-length models across diverse VLM architectures, including the recently popularized AnyRes-based visual encoders. Furthermore, through qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that DToMe effectively adapts token reduction based on image complexity and, unlike existing systems, provides users more control over computational costs.

- **[V$^2$R-Bench: Holistically Evaluating LVLM Robustness to Fundamental Visual Variations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16727)**  `arXiv:2504.16727`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhiyuan Fan, Yumeng Wang, Sandeep Polisetty, Yi R. Fung_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) excel in various vision-language tasks. Yet, their robustness to visual variations in position, scale, orientation, and context that objects in natural scenes inevitably exhibit due to changes in viewpoint and environment remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce V$^2$R-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating Visual Variation Robustness of LVLMs, which encompasses automated evaluation dataset generation and principled metrics for thorough robustness assessment. Through extensive evaluation on 21 LVLMs, we reveal a surprising vulnerability to visual variations, in which even advanced models that excel at complex vision-language tasks significantly underperform on simple tasks such as object recognition. Interestingly, these models exhibit a distinct visual position bias that contradicts theories of effective receptive fields, and demonstrate a human-like visual acuity threshold. To identify the source of these vulnerabilities, we present a systematic framework for component-level analysis, featuring a novel visualization approach for aligned visual features. Results show that these vulnerabilities stem from error accumulation in the pipeline architecture and inadequate multimodal alignment. Complementary experiments with synthetic data further demonstrate that these limitations are fundamentally architectural deficiencies, scoring the need for architectural innovations in future LVLM designs.

- **[Meta-Entity Driven Triplet Mining for Aligning Medical Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15929)**  `arXiv:2504.15929`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  Diagnostic imaging relies on interpreting both images and radiology reports, but the growing data volumes place significant pressure on medical experts, yielding increased errors and workflow backlogs. Medical vision-language models (med-VLMs) have emerged as a powerful framework to efficiently process multimodal imaging data, particularly in chest X-ray (CXR) evaluations, albeit their performance hinges on how well image and text representations are aligned. Existing alignment methods, predominantly based on contrastive learning, prioritize separation between disease classes over segregation of fine-grained pathology attributes like location, size or severity, leading to suboptimal representations. Here, we propose MedTrim (Meta-entity-driven Triplet mining), a novel method that enhances image-text alignment through multimodal triplet learning synergistically guided by disease class as well as adjectival and directional pathology descriptors. Unlike common alignment methods that separate broad disease classes, MedTrim leverages structured meta-entity information to preserve subtle but clinically significant intra-class variations. For this purpose, we first introduce an ontology-based entity recognition module that extracts pathology-specific meta-entities from CXR reports, as annotations on pathology attributes are rare in public datasets. For refined sample selection in triplet mining, we then introduce a novel score function that captures an aggregate measure of inter-sample similarity based on disease classes and adjectival/directional descriptors. Lastly, we introduce a multimodal triplet alignment objective for explicit within- and cross-modal alignment between samples sharing detailed pathology characteristics. Our demonstrations indicate that MedTrim improves performance in downstream retrieval and classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art alignment methods.

  _Ximing Wen, Mallika Mainali, Anik Sen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks; however, their ability to perform Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks, such as inferring human intentions, beliefs, and mental states, remains underexplored. We propose an open-ended question framework to evaluate VLMs' performance across diverse categories of ToM tasks. We curated and annotated a benchmark dataset of 30 images and evaluated the performance of four VLMs of varying sizes. Our results show that the GPT-4 model outperformed all the others, with only one smaller model, GPT-4o-mini, achieving comparable performance. We observed that VLMs often struggle to infer intentions in complex scenarios such as bullying or cheating. Our findings reveal that smaller models can sometimes infer correct intentions despite relying on incorrect visual cues. The dataset is available atthis https URL.

- **[Token-Shuffle: Towards High-Resolution Image Generation with Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17789)**  `arXiv:2504.17789`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xu Ma, Peize Sun, Haoyu Ma, Hao Tang, Chih-Yao Ma, Jialiang Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive (AR) models, long dominant in language generation, are increasingly applied to image synthesis but are often considered less competitive than Diffusion-based models. A primary limitation is the substantial number of image tokens required for AR models, which constrains both training and inference efficiency, as well as image resolution. To address this, we present Token-Shuffle, a novel yet simple method that reduces the number of image tokens in Transformer. Our key insight is the dimensional redundancy of visual vocabularies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where low-dimensional visual codes from visual encoder are directly mapped to high-dimensional language vocabularies. Leveraging this, we consider two key operations: token-shuffle, which merges spatially local tokens along channel dimension to decrease the input token number, and token-unshuffle, which untangles the inferred tokens after Transformer blocks to restore the spatial arrangement for output. Jointly training with textual prompts, our strategy requires no additional pretrained text-encoder and enables MLLMs to support extremely high-resolution image synthesis in a unified next-token prediction way while maintaining efficient training and inference. For the first time, we push the boundary of AR text-to-image generation to a resolution of 2048x2048 with gratifying generation performance. In GenAI-benchmark, our 2.7B model achieves 0.77 overall score on hard prompts, outperforming AR models LlamaGen by 0.18 and diffusion models LDM by 0.15. Exhaustive large-scale human evaluations also demonstrate our prominent image generation ability in terms of text-alignment, visual flaw, and visual appearance. We hope that Token-Shuffle can serve as a foundational design for efficient high-resolution image generation within MLLMs.

  The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) framework has become a widely used approach for multimodal representation learning, particularly in image-text retrieval and clustering. However, its efficacy is constrained by three key limitations: (1) text token truncation, (2) isolated image-text encoding, and (3) deficient compositionality due to bag-of-words behavior. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in generalized vision-language understanding, their potential for learning transferable multimodal representations remainsthis http URLthis work, we present UniME (Universal Multimodal Embedding), a novel two-stage framework that leverages MLLMs to learn discriminative representations for diverse downstream tasks. In the first stage, we perform textual discriminative knowledge distillation from a powerful LLM-based teacher model to enhance the embedding capability of the MLLM≈õ language component. In the second stage, we introduce hard negative enhanced instruction tuning to further advance discriminative representation learning. Specifically, we initially mitigate false negative contamination and then sample multiple hard negatives per instance within each batch, forcing the model to focus on challenging samples. This approach not only improves discriminative power but also enhances instruction-following ability in downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, including short and long caption retrieval and compositional retrieval. Results demonstrate that UniME achieves consistent performance improvement across all tasks, exhibiting superior discriminative and compositional capabilities.

- **[SDVPT: Semantic-Driven Visual Prompt Tuning for Open-World Object Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17395)**  `arXiv:2504.17395`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yiming Zhao, Guorong Li, Laiyun Qing, Amin Beheshti, Jian Yang, Michael Sheng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-world object counting leverages the robust text-image alignment of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to enable counting of arbitrary categories in images specified by textual queries. However, widely adopted naive fine-tuning strategies concentrate exclusively on text-image consistency for categories contained in training, which leads to limited generalizability for unseen categories. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play Semantic-Driven Visual Prompt Tuning framework (SDVPT) that transfers knowledge from the training set to unseen categories with minimal overhead in parameters and inference time. First, we introduce a two-stage visual prompt learning strategy composed of Category-Specific Prompt Initialization (CSPI) and Topology-Guided Prompt Refinement (TGPR). The CSPI generates category-specific visual prompts, and then TGPR distills latent structural patterns from the VLM's text encoder to refine these prompts. During inference, we dynamically synthesize the visual prompts for unseen categories based on the semantic correlation between unseen and training categories, facilitating robust text-image alignment for unseen categories. Extensive experiments integrating SDVPT with all available open-world object counting models demonstrate its effectiveness and adaptability across three widely used datasets: FSC-147, CARPK, and PUCPR+.

- **[Perspective-Aware Reasoning in Vision-Language Models via Mental Imagery Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17207)**  `arXiv:2504.17207`  `cs.CV`  
  _Phillip Y. Lee, Jihyeon Je, Chanho Park, Mikaela Angelina Uy, Leonidas Guibas, Minhyuk Sung_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a framework for perspective-aware reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) through mental imagery simulation. Perspective-taking, the ability to perceive an environment or situation from an alternative viewpoint, is a key benchmark for human-level visual understanding, essential for environmental interaction and collaboration with autonomous agents. Despite advancements in spatial reasoning within VLMs, recent research has shown that modern VLMs significantly lack perspective-aware reasoning capabilities and exhibit a strong bias toward egocentric interpretations. To bridge the gap between VLMs and human perception, we focus on the role of mental imagery, where humans perceive the world through abstracted representations that facilitate perspective shifts. Motivated by this, we propose a framework for perspective-aware reasoning, named Abstract Perspective Change (APC), that effectively leverages vision foundation models, such as object detection, segmentation, and orientation estimation, to construct scene abstractions and enable perspective transformations. Our experiments on synthetic and real-image benchmarks, compared with various VLMs, demonstrate significant improvements in perspective-aware reasoning with our framework, further outperforming fine-tuned spatial reasoning models and novel-view-synthesis-based approaches.

- **[Dynamic Pyramid Network for Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20322)**  `arXiv:2503.20322`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hao Ai, Kunyi Wang, Zezhou Wang, Hao Lu, Jin Tian, Yaxin Luo, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various vision-language (VL) tasks, but their expensive computations still limit the real-world application. To address this issue, recent efforts aim to compress the visual features to save the computational costs of MLLMs. However, direct visual compression methods, e.g. efficient projectors, inevitably destroy the visual semantics in MLLM, especially in difficult samples. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel dynamic pyramid network (DPN) for efficient MLLMs. Specifically, DPN formulates MLLM as a hierarchical structure where visual features are gradually compressed with increasing depth. In this case, even with a high compression ratio, fine-grained visual information can still be perceived in shallow layers. To maximize the benefit of DPN, we further propose an innovative Dynamic Pooling Experts (DPE) that can dynamically choose the optimal visual compression rate according to input features. With this design, harder samples will be assigned larger computations, thus preserving the model performance. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on two popular MLLMs and ten benchmarks. Experimental results show that DPN can save up to 56% average FLOPs on LLaVA while further achieving +0.74% performance gains. Besides, the generalization ability of DPN is also validated on the existing high-resolution MLLM called LLaVA-HR. The source code will be released atthis https URL.

- **[HierarQ: Task-Aware Hierarchical Q-Former for Enhanced Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08585)**  `arXiv:2503.08585`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shehreen Azad, Vibhav Vineet, Yogesh Singh Rawat_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), current approaches struggle in medium-to-long video understanding due to frame and context length limitations. As a result, these models often depend on frame sampling, which risks missing key information over time and lacks task-specific relevance. To address these challenges, we introduce HierarQ, a task-aware hierarchical Q-Former based framework that sequentially processes frames to bypass the need for frame sampling, while avoiding LLM's context length limitations. We introduce a lightweight two-stream language-guided feature modulator to incorporate task awareness in video understanding, with the entity stream capturing frame-level object information within a short context and the scene stream identifying their broader interactions over longer period of time. Each stream is supported by dedicated memory banks which enables our proposed Hierachical Querying transformer (HierarQ) to effectively capture short and long-term context. Extensive evaluations on 10 video benchmarks across video understanding, question answering, and captioning tasks demonstrate HierarQ's state-of-the-art performance across most datasets, proving its robustness and efficiency for comprehensive video analysis.

- **[Data-Driven Calibration of Prediction Sets in Large Vision-Language Models Based on Inductive Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17671)**  `arXiv:2504.17671`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Yuanchang Ye, Weiyan Wen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study addresses the critical challenge of hallucination mitigation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks through a Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) framework. While LVLMs excel in multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under user-defined risk levels ($\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous control of \textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain strictly below $\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes inversely with $\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces theoretical guarantees across all $\alpha$ values. The framework achieves stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios, underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems, offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

- **[GeoSense: Evaluating Identification and Application of Geometric Principles in Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12597)**  `arXiv:2504.12597`  `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Geometry problem-solving (GPS), a challenging task requiring both visual comprehension and symbolic reasoning, effectively measures the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Humans exhibit strong reasoning ability in this task through accurate identification and adaptive application of geometric principles within visual contexts. However, existing benchmarks fail to jointly assess both dimensions of the human-like geometric reasoning mechanism in MLLMs, remaining a critical gap in assessing their ability to tackle GPS. To this end, we introduce GeoSense, the first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the geometric reasoning abilities of MLLMs through the lens of geometric principles. GeoSense features a five-level hierarchical framework of geometric principles spanning plane and solid geometry, an intricately annotated dataset of 1,789 problems, and an innovative evaluation strategy. Through extensive experiments on GeoSense with various open-source and closed-source MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.0-pro-flash performs best, achieving an overall score of $65.3$. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the identification and application of geometric principles remain a bottleneck for leading MLLMs, jointly hindering their reasoning abilities. These findings underscore GeoSense's potential to guide future advancements in MLLMs' geometric reasoning capabilities, paving the way for more robust and human-like reasoning in artificial intelligence.

- **[Cracking the Code of Action: a Generative Approach to Affordances for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17282)**  `arXiv:2504.17282`  `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agents that can autonomously navigate the web through a graphical user interface (GUI) using a unified action space (e.g., mouse and keyboard actions) can require very large amounts of domain-specific expert demonstrations to achieve good performance. Low sample efficiency is often exacerbated in sparse-reward and large-action-space environments, such as a web GUI, where only a few actions are relevant in any given situation. In this work, we consider the low-data regime, with limited or no access to expert behavior. To enable sample-efficient learning, we explore the effect of constraining the action space through $\textit{intent-based affordances}$ -- i.e., considering in any situation only the subset of actions that achieve a desired outcome. We propose $\textbf{Code as Generative Affordances}$ $(\textbf{$\texttt{CoGA}$})$, a method that leverages pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to generate code that determines affordable actions through implicit intent-completion functions and using a fully-automated program generation and verification pipeline. These programs are then used in-the-loop of a reinforcement learning agent to return a set of affordances given a pixel observation. By greatly reducing the number of actions that an agent must consider, we demonstrate on a wide range of tasks in the MiniWob++ benchmark that: $\textbf{1)}$ $\texttt{CoGA}$ is orders of magnitude more sample efficient than its RL agent, $\textbf{2)}$ $\texttt{CoGA}$'s programs can generalize within a family of tasks, and $\textbf{3)}$ $\texttt{CoGA}$ performs better or on par compared with behavior cloning when a small number of expert demonstrations is available.
