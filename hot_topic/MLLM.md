- **[Step-3 is Large yet Affordable: Model-system Co-design for Cost-effective Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19427)**  `arXiv:2507.19427`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  Large language models (LLMs) face low hardware efficiency during decoding, especially for long-context reasoning tasks. This paper introduces Step-3, a 321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs achieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under 50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324 in the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.

- **[Eyes Will Shut: A Vision-Based Next GPS Location Prediction Model by Reinforcement Learning from Visual Map Feed Back](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18661)**  `arXiv:2507.18661`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However, the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor, which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.

- **[CircuitProbe: Dissecting Spatiotemporal Visual Semantics with Circuit Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19420)**  `arXiv:2507.19420`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The processing mechanisms underlying language and image understanding in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied. However, the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a systematic, circuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual semantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our framework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing circuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we discover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object tokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%. Furthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions emerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs. In contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we reveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional localization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a foundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.

- **[Verbalized Representation Learning for Interpretable Few-Shot Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18651)**  `arXiv:2411.18651`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL` `cs.LG`

  Humans recognize objects after observing only a few examples, a remarkable capability enabled by their inherent language understanding of the real-world environment. Developing verbalized and interpretable representation can significantly improve model generalization in low-data settings. In this work, we propose Verbalized Representation Learning (VRL), a novel approach for automatically extracting human-interpretable features for object recognition using few-shot data. Our method uniquely captures inter-class differences and intra-class commonalities in the form of natural language by employing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to identify key discriminative features between different classes and shared characteristics within the same class. These verbalized features are then mapped to numeric vectors through the VLM. The resulting feature vectors can be further utilized to train and infer with downstream classifiers. Experimental results show that, at the same model scale, VRL achieves a 24% absolute improvement over prior state-of-the-art methods while using 95% less data and a smaller mode. Furthermore, compared to human-labeled attributes, the features learned by VRL exhibit a 20% absolute gain when used for downstream classification tasks. Code is available at:this https URL.

- **[Towards Scalable Spatial Intelligence via 2D-to-3D Data Lifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18678)**  `arXiv:2507.18678`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Xingyu Miao, Haoran Duan, Quanhao Qian, Jiuniu Wang, Yang Long, Ling Shao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatial intelligence is emerging as a transformative frontier in AI, yet it remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. Unlike the abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic 3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence. We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting with physical environments.

- **[FrameFusion: Combining Similarity and Importance for Video Token Reduction on Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01986)**  `arXiv:2501.01986`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Tianyu Fu, Tengxuan Liu, Qinghao Han, Guohao Dai, Shengen Yan, Huazhong Yang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing demand to process long and high-resolution videos significantly burdens Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the enormous number of visual tokens. Existing token reduction methods primarily prune tokens based on importance metrics, such as cumulative attention scores. However, even important tokens may exhibit high redundancy caused by similarity among adjacent video frames and repetitive visual elements. To address this limitation, we propose FrameFusion, a novel token reduction approach integrating similarity-based merging with importance-based pruning. We conduct a thorough study on token similarity characteristics, revealing three key insights: (1) spatially corresponding visual tokens between adjacent frames have higher cosine similarities compared to other token pairs; (2) high token similarities prominently decrease in deeper model layers; and (3) token similarity rankings are highly consistent across different layers. Guided by these observations, FrameFusion computes token similarities exclusively between corresponding visual tokens from adjacent frames, applies token merging at initial successive layers followed by pruning in deeper layers, and adopts a cascaded merging strategy to further enhance efficiency. We evaluate FrameFusion comprehensively across six diverse LVLMs, ranging from 2B to 72B parameters, using five video benchmarks encompassing video retrieval, question-answering, and spatial-temporal understanding tasks. Experiments show that FrameFusion reduces visual tokens by 70%, achieving 1.6-3.6x end-to-end speedups, with an average performance impact of less than 3%. Our code is available at:this https URL.

- **[RemoteReasoner: Towards Unifying Geospatial Reasoning Workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19280)**  `arXiv:2507.19280`  `cs.CV`  
  _Liang Yao, Fan Liu, Hongbo Lu, Chuanyi Zhang, Rui Min, Shengxiang Xu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data, demanding sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it should be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do not constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be unified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks with distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote sensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on supervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote sensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing targets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity output generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for precise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable diverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific decoders or further fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that RemoteReasoner achieves remarkable performance across multi-granularity reasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level. Additionally, our framework enables novel capabilities such as the contour extraction task beyond the reach of existing reasoning pipelines.

- **[SimMLM: A Simple Framework for Multi-modal Learning with Missing Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19264)**  `arXiv:2507.19264`  `cs.CV`  
  _Sijie Li, Chen Chen, Jungong Han_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness. Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts (DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer (MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS 2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy, interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing modality scenarios at test time.

- **[OVFact: Measuring and Improving Open-Vocabulary Factuality for Long Caption Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19262)**  `arXiv:2507.19262`  `cs.CV`  
  _Monika Wysocza≈Ñska, Shyamal Buch, Anurag Arnab, Cordelia Schmid_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate long and factual captions. However, traditional measures for hallucination and factuality are not well suited for evaluating longer, more diverse captions and in settings where ground-truth human-annotated captions are unavailable. We introduce OV-Fact, a novel method for measuring caption factuality of long captions that leverages open-vocabulary visual grounding and tool-based verification without depending on human annotations. Our method improves agreement with human judgments and captures both caption descriptiveness (recall) and factual precision in the same metric. Furthermore, unlike previous metrics, our reference-free method design enables new applications towards factuality-based data filtering. We observe models trained on an OVFact-filtered (2.5-5x less) subset of a large-scale, noisy (VLM-generated) pretraining set meaningfully improve factuality precision without sacrificing caption descriptiveness across a range of downstream long caption benchmarks.

- **[PRE-MAP: Personalized Reinforced Eye-tracking Multimodal LLM for High-Resolution Multi-Attribute Point Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19213)**  `arXiv:2507.19213`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual selective attention, driven by individual preferences, regulates human prioritization of visual stimuli by bridging subjective cognitive mechanisms with objective visual elements, thereby steering the semantic interpretation and hierarchical processing of dynamic visual scenes. However, existing models and datasets predominantly neglect the influence of subjective cognitive diversity on fixation behavior. Conventional saliency prediction models, typically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to generate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which limiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns. Furthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it very costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving multiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is challenging. To address these limitations, we present Subjective Personalized Attention for Advertisement Videos, namely SPA-ADV, a large-scale multimodal dataset capturing gaze behaviors from over 4,500 participants varying in age and gender with 486 videos. Furthermore, we propose PRE-MAP, a novel eye-tracking saliency model that characterizes Personalized visual disparities through Reinforcement learning-optimized Eye-tracking, built upon MLLMs and guided by Multi-Attribute user profiles to predict Points. To ensure MLLMs produce prediction points that are both format-correct and spatially accurate, we introduce Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), inspired by the variability in eye movement points and Multi-Attribute profiles. Extensive experiments on SPA-ADV and other benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code and dataset are available at \href{this https URL}{this URL}.

- **[LISA: A Layer-wise Integration and Suppression Approach for Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19110)**  `arXiv:2507.19110`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhihui Guo, Xin Man, Hui Xu, Jie Shao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks such as image captioning but remain prone to object hallucinations, where they describe objects that do not appear in the image. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{LISA}, a \textbf{L}ayer-wise \textbf{I}ntegration and \textbf{S}uppression \textbf{A}pproach that enhances generation consistency through hierarchical modulation and multi-layer fusion. LISA leverages the functional hierarchy within MLLMs, where shallow layers provide visual grounding, middle layers encode semantics, and deep layers tend to amplify spurious signals. First, zone-specific spectral modulation stabilizes attention by suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving alignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected layers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and soft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding. LISA is fully \textbf{plug-and-play} and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, including Qwen2.5-VL. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that LISA reduces hallucinations by up to 53.6\% in $\mathrm{CHAIR}_I$ and improves POPE F1 by 4.5\%, demonstrating strong generalization across models and tasks.

- **[Negation-Aware Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19064)**  `arXiv:2507.19064`  `cs.CV`  
  _Haochen Han, Alex Jinpeng Wang, Fangming Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we study a practical but less-touched problem in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \ie, negation understanding. Specifically, many real-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or non-existent, \eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific conditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale training, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation. To address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the scarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive data containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions demand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable widespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically observe that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the affirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related parameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in consistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in unrelated semantics. Extensive experiments on the various negation understanding tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for integrating visual and textual information, supporting a wide range of multi-modal tasks. However, these models often suffer from hallucination, producing content that appears plausible but contradicts the input content or established world knowledge. This survey offers an in-depth review of hallucination evaluation benchmarks and detection methods across Image-to-Text (I2T) and Text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. Specifically, we first propose a taxonomy of hallucination based on faithfulness and factuality, incorporating the common types of hallucinations observed in practice. Then we provide an overview of existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks for both T2I and I2T tasks, highlighting their construction process, evaluation objectives, and employed metrics. Furthermore, we summarize recent advances in hallucination detection methods, which aims to identify hallucinated content at the instance level and serve as a practical complement of benchmark-based evaluation. Finally, we highlight key limitations in current benchmarks and detection methods, and outline potential directions for future research.

- **[SAR-TEXT: A Large-Scale SAR Image-Text Dataset Built with SAR-Narrator and Progressive Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18743)**  `arXiv:2507.18743`  `cs.CV`

  Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To construct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive transfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks: image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT: SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and 10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding those of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that, as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.

- **[AgMMU: A Comprehensive Agricultural Multimodal Understanding Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10568)**  `arXiv:2504.10568`  `cs.CV`  
  _Aruna Gauba, Irene Pi, Yunze Man, Ziqi Pang, Vikram S. Adve, Yu-Xiong Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present AgMMU, a challenging real-world benchmark for evaluating and advancing vision-language models (VLMs) in the knowledge-intensive domain of agriculture. Unlike prior datasets that rely on crowdsourced prompts, AgMMU is distilled from 116,231 authentic dialogues between everyday growers and USDA-authorized Cooperative Extension experts. Through a three-stage pipeline: automated knowledge extraction, QA generation, and human verification, we construct (i) AgMMU, an evaluation set of 746 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and 746 open-ended questions (OEQs), and (ii) AgBase, a development corpus of 57,079 multimodal facts covering five high-stakes agricultural topics: insect identification, species identification, disease categorization, symptom description, and management instruction. Benchmarking 12 leading VLMs reveals pronounced gaps in fine-grained perception and factual grounding. Open-sourced models trail after proprietary ones by a wide margin. Simple fine-tuning on AgBase boosts open-sourced model performance on challenging OEQs for up to 11.6% on average, narrowing this gap and also motivating future research to propose better strategies in knowledge extraction and distillation from AgBase. We hope AgMMU stimulates research on domain-specific knowledge integration and trustworthy decision support in agriculture AI development.

- **[Long-Form Answers to Visual Questions from Blind and Low Vision People](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06303)**  `arXiv:2408.06303`  `cs.CL` `cs.CV`  
  _Mina Huh, Fangyuan Xu, Yi-Hao Peng, Chongyan Chen, Hansika Murugu, Danna Gurari, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision language models can now generate long-form answers to questions about images - long-form visual question answers (LFVQA). We contribute VizWiz-LF, a dataset of long-form answers to visual questions posed by blind and low vision (BLV) users. VizWiz-LF contains 4.2k long-form answers to 600 visual questions, collected from human expert describers and six VQA models. We develop and annotate functional roles of sentences of LFVQA and demonstrate that long-form answers contain information beyond the question answer such as explanations and suggestions. We further conduct automatic and human evaluations with BLV and sighted people to evaluate long-form answers. BLV people perceive both human-written and generated long-form answers to be plausible, but generated answers often hallucinate incorrect visual details, especially for unanswerable visual questions (e.g., blurry or irrelevant images). To reduce hallucinations, we evaluate the ability of VQA models to abstain from answering unanswerable questions across multiple prompting strategies.
