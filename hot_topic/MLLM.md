  Enabling robots to perform diverse tasks across varied environments is a central challenge in robot learning. While vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise for generalizable robot skills, realizing their full potential requires addressing limitations in action representation and efficient training. Current VLA models often focus on scaling the vision-language model (VLM) component, while the action space representation remains a critical bottleneck. This paper introduces DexVLA, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and generalization capabilities of VLAs for complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse robot embodiments. DexVLA features a novel diffusion-based action expert, scaled to one billion parameters, designed for cross-embodiment learning. A novel embodiment curriculum learning strategy facilitates efficient training: (1) pre-training the diffusion expert that is separable from the VLA on cross-embodiment data, (2) aligning the VLA model to specific embodiments, and (3) post-training for rapid adaptation to new tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple embodiments, including single-arm, bimanual, and dexterous hand, demonstrating DexVLA's adaptability to challenging tasks without task-specific adaptation, its ability to learn dexterous skills on novel embodiments with limited data, and its capacity to complete complex, long-horizon tasks using only direct language prompting, such as laundry folding. In all settings, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models like Octo, OpenVLA, and Diffusion Policy.

- **[From Seeing to Doing: Bridging Reasoning and Decision for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08548)**  `arXiv:2505.08548`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  Achieving generalization in robotic manipulation remains a critical challenge, particularly for unseen scenarios and novel tasks. Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, while building on top of general Vision-Language Models (VLMs), still fall short of achieving robust zero-shot performance due to the scarcity and heterogeneity prevalent in embodied datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FSD (From Seeing to Doing), a novel vision-language model that generates intermediate representations through spatial relationship reasoning, providing fine-grained guidance for robotic manipulation. Our approach combines a hierarchical data pipeline for training with a self-consistency mechanism that aligns spatial coordinates with visual signals. Through extensive experiments, we comprehensively validated FSD's capabilities in both "seeing" and "doing," achieving outstanding performance across 8 benchmarks for general spatial reasoning and embodied reference abilities, as well as on our proposed more challenging benchmark VABench. We also verified zero-shot capabilities in robot manipulation, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods in both SimplerEnv and real robot settings. Experimental results show that FSD achieves 54.1% success rate in SimplerEnv and 72% success rate across 8 real-world tasks, outperforming the strongest baseline by 30%.

  The UAV-VLA (Visual-Language-Action) system is a tool designed to facilitate communication with aerial robots. By integrating satellite imagery processing with the Visual Language Model (VLM) and the powerful capabilities of GPT, UAV-VLA enables users to generate general flight paths-and-action plans through simple text requests. This system leverages the rich contextual information provided by satellite images, allowing for enhanced decision-making and mission planning. The combination of visual analysis by VLM and natural language processing by GPT can provide the user with the path-and-action set, making aerial operations more efficient and accessible. The newly developed method showed the difference in the length of the created trajectory in 22% and the mean error in finding the objects of interest on a map in 34.22 m by Euclidean distance in the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) approach.

  _Xianghui Wang, Xinming Zhang, Yanjun Chen, Xiaoyu Shen, Wei Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated excellent high-level planning capabilities, enabling locomotion skill learning from video demonstrations without the need for meticulous human-level reward design. However, the improper frame sampling method and low training efficiency of current methods remain a critical bottleneck, resulting in substantial computational overhead and time costs. To address this limitation, we propose Motion-aware Rapid Reward Optimization for Efficient Robot Skill Learning from Single Videos (MA-ROESL). MA-ROESL integrates a motion-aware frame selection method to implicitly enhance the quality of VLM-generated reward functions. It further employs a hybrid three-phase training pipeline that improves training efficiency via rapid reward optimization and derives the final policy through online fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that MA-ROESL significantly enhances training efficiency while faithfully reproducing locomotion skills in both simulated and real-world settings, thereby underscoring its potential as a robust and scalable framework for efficient robot locomotion skill learning from video demonstrations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in integrating tactile sensing with vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for robotic multimodal perception. However, existing tactile descriptions remain limited to superficial attributes like texture, neglecting critical contact states essential for robotic manipulation. To bridge this gap, we propose CLTP, an intuitive and effective language tactile pretraining framework that aligns tactile 3D point clouds with natural language in various contact scenarios, thus enabling contact-state-aware tactile language understanding for contact-rich manipulation tasks. We first collect a novel dataset of 50k+ tactile 3D point cloud-language pairs, where descriptions explicitly capture multidimensional contact states (e.g., contact location, shape, and force) from the tactile sensor's perspective. CLTP leverages a pre-aligned and frozen vision-language feature space to bridge holistic textual and tactile modalities. Experiments validate its superiority in three downstream tasks: zero-shot 3D classification, contact state classification, and tactile 3D large language model (LLM) interaction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to align tactile and language representations from the contact state perspective for manipulation tasks, providing great potential for tactile-language-action model learning.

  Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are effective in well-defined environments, they often struggle to generalize their learned policies to dynamic settings due to their reliance on trial-and-error interactions. Recent work has explored applying Large Language Models (LLMs) or Vision Language Models (VLMs) to boost the generalization of RL agents through policy optimization guidance or prior knowledge. However, these approaches often lack seamless coordination between the RL agent and the foundation model, leading to unreasonable decision-making in unfamiliar environments and efficiency bottlenecks. Making full use of the inferential capabilities of foundation models and the rapid response capabilities of RL agents and enhancing the interaction between the two to form a dual system is still a lingering scientific question. To address this problem, we draw inspiration from Kahneman's theory of fast thinking (System 1) and slow thinking (System 2), demonstrating that balancing intuition and deep reasoning can achieve nimble decision-making in a complex world. In this study, we propose a Dual-System Adaptive Decision Framework (DSADF), integrating two complementary modules: System 1, comprising an RL agent and a memory space for fast and intuitive decision making, and System 2, driven by a VLM for deep and analytical reasoning. DSADF facilitates efficient and adaptive decision-making by combining the strengths of both systems. The empirical study in the video game environment: Crafter and Housekeep demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method, showing significant improvements in decision abilities for both unseen and known tasks.

  Compared to image-text pair data, interleaved corpora enable Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand the world more naturally like humans. However, such existing datasets are crawled from webpage, facing challenges like low knowledge density, loose image-text relations, and poor logical coherence between images. On the other hand, the internet hosts vast instructional videos (e.g., online geometry courses) that are widely used by humans to learn foundational subjects, yet these valuable resources remain underexplored in VLM training. In this paper, we introduce a high-quality \textbf{multimodal textbook} corpus with richer foundational knowledge for VLM pretraining. It collects over 2.5 years of instructional videos, totaling 22,000 class hours. We first use an LLM-proposed taxonomy to systematically gather instructional videos. Then we progressively extract and refine visual (keyframes), audio (ASR), and textual knowledge (OCR) from the videos, and organize as an image-text interleaved corpus based on temporal order. Compared to its counterparts, our video-centric textbook offers more coherent context, richer knowledge, and better image-text alignment. Experiments demonstrate its superb pretraining performance, particularly in knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks like ScienceQA and MathVista. Moreover, VLMs pre-trained on our textbook exhibit outstanding interleaved context awareness, leveraging visual and textual cues in their few-shot context for task solving. Our code are available atthis https URL.

  Many practical vision-language applications require models that understand negation, e.g., when using natural language to retrieve images which contain certain objects but not others. Despite advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) through large-scale training, their ability to comprehend negation remains underexplored. This study addresses the question: how well do current VLMs understand negation? We introduce NegBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate negation understanding across 18 task variations and $79$k examples spanning image, video, and medical datasets. The benchmark consists of two core tasks designed to evaluate negation understanding in diverse multimodal settings: Retrieval with Negation and Multiple Choice Questions with Negated Captions. Our evaluation reveals that modern VLMs struggle significantly with negation, often performing at chance level. To address these shortcomings, we explore a data-centric approach wherein we finetune CLIP models on large-scale synthetic datasets containing millions of negated captions. We show that this approach can result in a 10% increase in recall on negated queries and a 28% boost in accuracy on multiple-choice questions with negated captions.

  The steady improvements of text-to-image (T2I) generative models lead to slow deprecation of automatic evaluation benchmarks that rely on static datasets, motivating researchers to seek alternative ways to evaluate the T2I progress. In this paper, we explore the potential of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as evaluator agents that interact with a T2I model, with the objective of assessing prompt-generation consistency and image aesthetics. We present Multimodal Text-to-Image Eval (MT2IE), an evaluation framework that iteratively generates prompts for evaluation, scores generated images and matches T2I evaluation of existing benchmarks with a fraction of the prompts used in existing static benchmarks. Moreover, we show that MT2IE's prompt-generation consistency scores have higher correlation with human judgment than scores previously introduced in the literature. MT2IE generates prompts that are efficient at probing T2I model performance, producing the same relative T2I model rankings as existing benchmarks while using only 1/80th the number of prompts for evaluation.

  With the rapid development of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), an increasing number of benchmarks have been established to evaluate the video understanding capabilities of these models. However, these benchmarks focus on standalone videos and mainly assess "visual elements" like human actions and object states. In reality, contemporary videos often encompass complex and continuous narratives, typically presented as a series. To address this challenge, we propose SeriesBench, a benchmark consisting of 105 carefully curated narrative-driven series, covering 28 specialized tasks that require deep narrative understanding. Specifically, we first select a diverse set of drama series spanning various genres. Then, we introduce a novel long-span narrative annotation method, combined with a full-information transformation approach to convert manual annotations into diverse task formats. To further enhance model capacity for detailed analysis of plot structures and character relationships within series, we propose a novel narrative reasoning framework, PC-DCoT. Extensive results on SeriesBench indicate that existing MLLMs still face significant challenges in understanding narrative-driven series, while PC-DCoT enables these MLLMs to achieve performance improvements. Overall, our SeriesBench and PC-DCoT highlight the critical necessity of advancing model capabilities to understand narrative-driven series, guiding the future development of MLLMs. SeriesBench is publicly available atthis https URL.

  Aerial Visual Object Search (AVOS) tasks in urban environments require Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to autonomously search for and identify target objects using visual and textual cues without external guidance. Existing approaches struggle in complex urban environments due to redundant semantic processing, similar object distinction, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To bridge this gap and support the AVOS task, we introduce CityAVOS, the first benchmark dataset for autonomous search of common urban objects. This dataset comprises 2,420 tasks across six object categories with varying difficulty levels, enabling comprehensive evaluation of UAV agents' search capabilities. To solve the AVOS tasks, we also propose PRPSearcher (Perception-Reasoning-Planning Searcher), a novel agentic method powered by multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that mimics human three-tier cognition. Specifically, PRPSearcher constructs three specialized maps: an object-centric dynamic semantic map enhancing spatial perception, a 3D cognitive map based on semantic attraction values for target reasoning, and a 3D uncertainty map for balanced exploration-exploitation search. Also, our approach incorporates a denoising mechanism to mitigate interference from similar objects and utilizes an Inspiration Promote Thought (IPT) prompting mechanism for adaptive action planning. Experimental results on CityAVOS demonstrate that PRPSearcher surpasses existing baselines in both success rate and search efficiency (on average: +37.69% SR, +28.96% SPL, -30.69% MSS, and -46.40% NE). While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights the need for better semantic reasoning and spatial exploration capabilities in AVOS tasks. This work establishes a foundation for future advances in embodied target search. Dataset and source code are available atthis https URL.

  The Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced image understanding. Their comprehension and reasoning capabilities enable promising applications in autonomous driving scenarios. However, existing research typically focuses on front-view perspectives and partial objects within scenes, struggling to achieve comprehensive scene understanding. Meanwhile, existing LVLMs suffer from the lack of mapping relationship between 2D and 3D and insufficient integration of 3D object localization and instruction understanding. To tackle these limitations, we first introduce NuInteract, a large-scale dataset with over 1.5M multi-view image language pairs spanning dense scene captions and diverse interactive tasks. Furthermore, we propose DriveMonkey, a simple yet effective framework that seamlessly integrates LVLMs with a spatial processor using a series of learnable queries. The spatial processor, designed as a plug-and-play component, can be initialized with pre-trained 3D detectors to improve 3D perception. Our experiments show that DriveMonkey outperforms general LVLMs, especially achieving a 9.86% notable improvement on the 3D visual grounding task. The dataset and code will be released atthis https URL.

  While humans can flexibly leverage interactive visual cognition for complex problem-solving, enabling Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to learn similarly adaptive behaviors with visual tools remains challenging. A significant hurdle is the current lack of standardized infrastructure, which hinders integrating diverse tools, generating rich interaction data, and training robust agents effectively. To address these gaps, we introduce OpenThinkIMG, the first open-source, comprehensive end-to-end framework for tool-augmented LVLMs. It features standardized vision tool interfaces, scalable trajectory generation for policy initialization, and a flexible training environment. Furthermore, considering supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on static demonstrations offers limited policy generalization for dynamic tool invocation, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework V-ToolRL to train LVLMs to learn adaptive policies for invoking external vision tools. V-ToolRL enables LVLMs to autonomously discover optimal tool-usage strategies by directly optimizing for task success using feedback from tool interactions. We empirically validate V-ToolRL on challenging chart reasoning tasks. Our RL-trained agent, built upon a Qwen2-VL-2B, significantly outperforms its SFT-initialized counterpart (+28.83 points) and surpasses established supervised tool-learning baselines like Taco and CogCom by an average of +12.7 points. Notably, it also surpasses prominent closed-source models like GPT-4.1 by +8.68 accuracy points. We hope OpenThinkIMG can serve as a foundational framework for advancing dynamic, tool-augmented visual reasoning, helping the community develop AI agents that can genuinely "think with images".

- **[VCRBench: Exploring Long-form Causal Reasoning Capabilities of Large Video Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08455)**  `arXiv:2505.08455`  `cs.CV`  
  _Pritam Sarkar, Ali Etemad_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite recent advances in video understanding, the capabilities of Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) to perform video-based causal reasoning remains underexplored, largely due to the absence of relevant and dedicated benchmarks for evaluating causal reasoning in visually grounded and goal-driven settings. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark named Video-based long-form Causal Reasoning (VCRBench). We create VCRBench using procedural videos of simple everyday activities, where the steps are deliberately shuffled with each clip capturing a key causal event, to test whether LVLMs can identify, reason about, and correctly sequence the events needed to accomplish a specific goal. Moreover, the benchmark is carefully designed to prevent LVLMs from exploiting linguistic shortcuts, as seen in multiple-choice or binary QA formats, while also avoiding the challenges associated with evaluating open-ended QA. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs on VCRBench suggests that these models struggle with video-based long-form causal reasoning, primarily due to their difficulty in modeling long-range causal dependencies directly from visual observations. As a simple step toward enabling such capabilities, we propose Recognition-Reasoning Decomposition (RRD), a modular approach that breaks video-based causal reasoning into two sub-tasks of video recognition and causal reasoning. Our experiments on VCRBench show that RRD significantly boosts accuracy on VCRBench, with gains of up to 25.2%. Finally, our thorough analysis reveals interesting insights, for instance, that LVLMs primarily rely on language knowledge for complex video-based long-form causal reasoning tasks.

- **[Visually Interpretable Subtask Reasoning for Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08084)**  `arXiv:2505.08084`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yu Cheng, Arushi Goel, Hakan Bilen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Answering complex visual questions like `Which red furniture can be used for sitting?' requires multi-step reasoning, including object recognition, attribute filtering, and relational understanding. Recent work improves interpretability in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by decomposing tasks into sub-task programs, but these methods are computationally expensive and less accurate due to poor adaptation to target data. To address this, we introduce VISTAR (Visually Interpretable Subtask-Aware Reasoning Model), a subtask-driven training framework that enhances both interpretability and reasoning by generating textual and visual explanations within MLLMs. Instead of relying on external models, VISTAR fine-tunes MLLMs to produce structured Subtask-of-Thought rationales (step-by-step reasoning sequences). Experiments on two benchmarks show that VISTAR consistently improves reasoning accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Our code and dataset will be available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating text-image content have been demonstrated by recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, their effectiveness in specialized domains-particularly those requiring resource-efficient and domain-specific adaptations-has remained limited. In this work, a lightweight multimodal language model termed MilChat is introduced, specifically adapted to analyze remote sensing imagery in secluded areas, including challenging missile launch sites. A new dataset, MilData, was compiled by verifying hundreds of aerial images through expert review, and subtle military installations were highlighted via detailed captions. Supervised fine-tuning on a 2B-parameter open-source MLLM with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning annotations was performed, enabling more accurate and interpretable explanations. Additionally, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was leveraged to enhance the model's ability to detect critical domain-specific cues-such as defensive layouts and key military structures-while minimizing false positives on civilian scenes. Through empirical evaluations, it has been shown that MilChat significantly outperforms both larger, general-purpose multimodal models and existing remote sensing-adapted approaches on open-ended captioning and classification metrics. Over 80% recall and 98% precision were achieved on the newly proposed MilData benchmark, underscoring the potency of targeted fine-tuning and reinforcement learning in specialized real-world applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to integrate visual and linguistic information, achieving near-human proficiency in tasks like object recognition, captioning, and visual question answering. However, current benchmarks typically focus on knowledge-centric evaluations that assess domain-specific expertise, often neglecting the core ability to reason about fundamental mathematical elements and visual concepts. We identify a gap in evaluating elementary-level math problems, which rely on explicit visual dependencies-requiring models to discern, integrate, and reason across multiple images while incorporating commonsense knowledge, all of which are crucial for advancing toward broader AGI capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VCBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal mathematical reasoning with explicit visual dependencies. VCBENCH includes 1,720 problems across six cognitive domains, featuring 6,697 images (averaging 3.9 per question) to ensure multi-image reasoning. We evaluate 26 state-of-the-art LVLMs on VCBENCH, revealing substantial performance disparities, with even the top models unable to exceed 50% accuracy. Our findings highlight the ongoing challenges in visual-mathematical integration and suggest avenues for future LVLM advancements. The project can be found atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), both general-domain models and those specifically tailored for remote sensing, has demonstrated exceptional perception and reasoning capabilities in Earth observation tasks. However, a benchmark for systematically evaluating their capabilities in this domain is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we propose CHOICE, an extensive benchmark designed to objectively evaluate the hierarchical remote sensing capabilities of VLMs. Focusing on 2 primary capability dimensions essential to remote sensing: perception and reasoning, we further categorize 6 secondary dimensions and 23 leaf tasks to ensure a well-rounded assessment coverage. CHOICE guarantees the quality of all 10,507 problems through a rigorous process of data collection from 50 globally distributed cities, question construction and quality control. The newly curated data and the format of multiple-choice questions with definitive answers allow for an objective and straightforward performance assessment. Our evaluation of 3 proprietary and 21 open-source VLMs highlights their critical limitations within this specialized context. We hope that CHOICE will serve as a valuable resource and offer deeper insights into the challenges and potential of VLMs in the field of remote sensing. We will release CHOICE atthis https URL.

  Building multimodal language models is fundamentally challenging: it requires aligning vision and language modalities, curating high-quality instruction data, and avoiding the degradation of existing text-only capabilities once vision is introduced. These difficulties are further magnified in the multilingual setting, where the need for multimodal data in different languages exacerbates existing data scarcity, machine translation often distorts meaning, and catastrophic forgetting is more pronounced. To address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce novel techniques spanning both data and modeling. First, we develop a synthetic annotation framework that curates high-quality, diverse multilingual multimodal instruction data, enabling Aya Vision models to produce natural, human-preferred responses to multimodal inputs across many languages. Complementing this, we propose a cross-modal model merging technique that mitigates catastrophic forgetting, effectively preserving text-only capabilities while simultaneously enhancing multimodal generative performance. Aya-Vision-8B achieves best-in-class performance compared to strong multimodal models such as Qwen-2.5-VL-7B, Pixtral-12B, and even much larger Llama-3.2-90B-Vision. We further scale this approach with Aya-Vision-32B, which outperforms models more than twice its size, such as Molmo-72B and LLaMA-3.2-90B-Vision. Our work advances multilingual progress on the multi-modal frontier, and provides insights into techniques that effectively bend the need for compute while delivering extremely high performance.

  Charts are ubiquitous as they help people understand and reason with data. Recently, various downstream tasks, such as chart question answering, chart2text, and fact-checking, have emerged. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise in tackling these tasks, but their evaluation is costly and time-consuming, limiting real-world deployment. While using LVLMs as judges to assess the chart comprehension capabilities of other LVLMs could streamline evaluation processes, challenges like proprietary datasets, restricted access to powerful models, and evaluation costs hinder their adoption in industrial settings. To this end, we present a comprehensive evaluation of 13 open-source LVLMs as judges for diverse chart comprehension and reasoning tasks. We design both pairwise and pointwise evaluation tasks covering criteria like factual correctness, informativeness, and relevancy. Additionally, we analyze LVLM judges based on format adherence, positional consistency, length bias, and instruction-following. We focus on cost-effective LVLMs (<10B parameters) suitable for both research and commercial use, following a standardized evaluation protocol and rubric to measure the LVLM judge's accuracy. Experimental results reveal notable variability: while some open LVLM judges achieve GPT-4-level evaluation performance (about 80% agreement with GPT-4 judgments), others struggle (below ~10% agreement). Our findings highlight that state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs can serve as cost-effective automatic evaluators for chart-related tasks, though biases such as positional preference and length bias persist.

  Flowcharts are indispensable tools in software design and business-process analysis, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) frequently misinterpret the directional arrows and graph topology that set these diagrams apart from natural images. We introduce a seven-stage pipeline grouped into three broader processes: (1) arrow-aware detection of nodes and arrow endpoints; (2) optical character recognition (OCR) to extract node text; and (3) construction of a structured prompt that guides the VLMs. Tested on a 90-question benchmark distilled from 30 annotated flowcharts, the method raises overall accuracy from 80 % to 89 % (+9 percentage points) without any task-specific fine-tuning. The gain is most pronounced for next-step queries (25/30 -> 30/30; 100 %, +17 pp); branch-result questions improve more modestly, and before-step questions remain difficult. A parallel evaluation with an LLM-as-a-Judge protocol shows the same trends, reinforcing the advantage of explicit arrow encoding. Limitations include dependence on detector and OCR precision, the small evaluation set, and residual errors at nodes with multiple incoming edges. Future work will enlarge the benchmark with synthetic and handwritten flowcharts and assess the approach on Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) and Unified Modeling Language (UML).

  Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents, driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), have emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling intelligent interaction with digital systems. This paper provides a structured survey of recent advances in GUI agents, focusing on architectures enhanced by Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first formalize GUI agent tasks as Markov Decision Processes and discuss typical execution environments and evaluation metrics. We then review the modular architecture of (M)LLM-based GUI agents, covering Perception, Planning, and Acting modules, and trace their evolution through representative works. Furthermore, we categorize GUI agent training methodologies into Prompt-based, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)-based, and RL-based approaches, highlighting the progression from simple prompt engineering to dynamic policy learning via RL. Our summary illustrates how recent innovations in multimodal perception, decision reasoning, and adaptive action generation have significantly improved the generalization and robustness of GUI agents in complex real-world environments. We conclude by identifying key challenges and future directions for building more capable and reliable GUI agents.
