- **[ABC: Achieving Better Control of Multimodal Embeddings using VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00329)**  `arXiv:2503.00329`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  Visual embedding models excel at zero-shot tasks like visual retrieval and classification. However, these models cannot be used for tasks that contain ambiguity or require user instruction. These tasks necessitate an embedding model which outputs can use a natural language instruction to control the representation of a visual embedding. Existing CLIP-based approaches embed images and text independently, and fuse the result. We find that this results in weak interactions between modalities, and poor user control over the representation. We introduce ABC, an open-source multimodal embedding model that uses a vision-language model backbone to deeply integrate image features with natural language instructions. ABC achieves best-for-size performance on MSCOCO image-to-text retrieval and is the top performing model on classification and VQA tasks in the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark. With a strongly unified vision-language representation, ABC can use natural language to solve subtle and potentially ambiguous visual retrieval problems. To evaluate this capability, we design CtrlBench, a benchmark that requires interleaving textual instructions with image content for correct retrieval. ABC advances the state of visual embeddings, outputting high-quality visual representations with natural language control. Our model and datasets are available at our project page:this https URL

- **[The Devil is in the EOS: Sequence Training for Detailed Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20077)**  `arXiv:2507.20077`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Abdelrahman Mohamed, Yova Kementchedjhieva_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.

- **[Architectural Co-Design for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection: Decoupling Representation and Dynamically Fusing Features in CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07819)**  `arXiv:2508.07819`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Ke Ma, Jun Long, Hongxiao Fei, Liujie Hua, Yiran Qian, Zhen Dai, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a significant adaptation gap when applied to Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD), stemming from their lack of local inductive biases for dense prediction and their reliance on inflexible feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal fusion. Our method integrates a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation models to dense perception tasks.

- **[StreamMem: Query-Agnostic KV Cache Memory for Streaming Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15717)**  `arXiv:2508.15717`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yanlai Yang, Zhuokai Zhao, Satya Narayan Shukla, Aashu Singh, Shlok Kumar Mishra, Lizhu Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios. Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware compression approaches.

- **[SurgWound-Bench: A Benchmark for Surgical Wound Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15189)**  `arXiv:2508.15189`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Jiahao Xu, Changchang Yin, Odysseas Chatzipanagiotou, Diamantis Tsilimigras, Kevin Clear, Bingsheng Yao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation. Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

- **[Waver: Wave Your Way to Lifelike Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15761)**  `arXiv:2508.15761`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yifu Zhang, Hao Yang, Yuqi Zhang, Yifei Hu, Fengda Zhu, Chuang Lin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V), image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single, integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably, it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art commercial solutions. We hope this technical report will help the community more efficiently train high-quality video generation models and accelerate progress in video generation technologies.

- **[LLM-empowered Dynamic Prompt Routing for Vision-Language Models Tuning under Long-Tailed Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15688)**  `arXiv:2508.15688`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yongju Jia, Jiarui Ma, Xiangxian Li, Baiqiao Zhang, Xianhui Cao, Juan Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs' pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks, including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

- **[XDR-LVLM: An Explainable Vision-Language Large Model for Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15168)**  `arXiv:2508.15168`  `cs.CV`  
  _Masato Ito, Kaito Tanaka, Keisuke Matsuda, Aya Nakayama_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM (eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports. These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations, showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

- **[Synthesizing Near-Boundary OOD Samples for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10225)**  `arXiv:2507.10225`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jinglun Li, Kaixun Jiang, Zhaoyu Chen, Bo Lin, Yao Tang, Weifeng Ge, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space, can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced, boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score, effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly surpasses existing methods, and the code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Omni-Video: Democratizing Unified Video Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06119)**  `arXiv:2507.06119`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhiyu Tan, Hao Yang, Luozheng Qin, Jia Gong, Mengping Yang, Hao Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Notable breakthroughs in unified understanding and generation modeling have led to remarkable advancements in image understanding, reasoning, production and editing, yet current foundational models predominantly focus on processing images, creating a gap in the development of unified models for video understanding and generation. This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.

- **[Understanding Co-speech Gestures in-the-wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22668)**  `arXiv:2503.22668`  `cs.CV`  
  _Sindhu B Hegde, K R Prajwal, Taein Kwon, Andrew Zisserman_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Co-speech gestures play a vital role in non-verbal communication. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for co-speech gesture understanding in the wild. Specifically, we propose three new tasks and benchmarks to evaluate a model's capability to comprehend gesture-speech-text associations: (i) gesture based retrieval, (ii) gesture word spotting, and (iii) active speaker detection using gestures. We present a new approach that learns a tri-modal video-gesture-speech-text representation to solve these tasks. By leveraging a combination of global phrase contrastive loss and local gesture-word coupling loss, we demonstrate that a strong gesture representation can be learned in a weakly supervised manner from videos in the wild. Our learned representations outperform previous methods, including large vision-language models (VLMs). Further analysis reveals that speech and text modalities capture distinct gesture related signals, underscoring the advantages of learning a shared tri-modal embedding space. The dataset, model, and code are available at:this https URL.

- **[BannerAgency: Advertising Banner Design with Multimodal LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11060)**  `arXiv:2503.11060`  `cs.CV`  
  _Heng Wang, Yotaro Shimose, Shingo Takamatsu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advertising banners are critical for capturing user attention and enhancing advertising campaign effectiveness. Creating aesthetically pleasing banner designs while conveying the campaign messages is challenging due to the large search space involving multiple design elements. Additionally, advertisers need multiple sizes for different displays and various versions to target different sectors of audiences. Since design is intrinsically an iterative and subjective process, flexible editability is also in high demand for practical usage. While current models have served as assistants to human designers in various design tasks, they typically handle only segments of the creative design process or produce pixel-based outputs that limit editability. This paper introduces a training-free framework for fully automated banner ad design creation, enabling frontier multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to streamline the production of effective banners with minimal manual effort across diverse marketing contexts. We present BannerAgency, an MLLM agent system that collaborates with advertisers to understand their brand identity and banner objectives, generates matching background images, creates blueprints for foreground design elements, and renders the final creatives as editable components in Figma or SVG formats rather than static pixels. To facilitate evaluation and future research, we introduce BannerRequest400, a benchmark featuring 100 unique logos paired with 400 diverse banner requests. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, emphasizing the quality of the generated banner designs, their adaptability to various banner requests, and their strong editability enabled by this component-based approach.

- **[EcomMMMU: Strategic Utilization of Visuals for Robust Multimodal E-Commerce Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15721)**  `arXiv:2508.15721`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Xinyi Ling, Hanwen Du, Zhihui Zhu, Xia Ning_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question: do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images. EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8 essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content. Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks. Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available throughthis https URL.

- **[Unveiling Trust in Multimodal Large Language Models: Evaluation, Analysis, and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15370)**  `arXiv:2508.15370`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Yichi Zhang, Yao Huang, Yifan Wang, Yitong Sun, Chang Liu, Zhe Zhao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities. Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and 28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

- **[ContextualLVLM-Agent: A Holistic Framework for Multi-Turn Visually-Grounded Dialogue and Complex Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15164)**  `arXiv:2508.15164`  `cs.CL`  
  _Seungmin Han, Haeun Kwon, Ji-jun Park, Taeyang Yoon_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions, leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth. Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction following capabilities through an iterative "memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance, attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth, instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

- **[Robust Bias Detection in MLMs and its Application to Human Trait Ratings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15600)**  `arXiv:2502.15600`  `cs.CL`  
  _Ingroj Shrestha, Louis Tay, Padmini Srinivasan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There has been significant prior work using templates to study bias against demographic attributes in MLMs. However, these have limitations: they overlook random variability of templates and target concepts analyzed, assume equality amongst templates, and overlook bias quantification. Addressing these, we propose a systematic statistical approach to assess bias in MLMs, using mixed models to account for random effects, pseudo-perplexity weights for sentences derived from templates and quantify bias using statistical effect sizes. Replicating prior studies, we match on bias scores in magnitude and direction with small to medium effect sizes. Next, we explore the novel problem of gender bias in the context of $\emph{personality}$ and $\textit{character}$ traits, across seven MLMs (base and large). We find that MLMs vary; ALBERT is unbiased for binary gender but the most biased for non-binary $\textit{neo}$, while RoBERTa-large is the most biased for binary gender but shows small to no bias for $\textit{neo}$. There is some alignment of MLM bias and findings in psychology (human perspective) - in $\textit{agreeableness}$ with RoBERTa-large and $\textit{emotional stability}$ with BERT-large. There is general agreement for the remaining 3 personality dimensions: both sides observe at most small differences across gender. For character traits, human studies on gender bias are limited thus comparisons are not feasible.

- **[See it. Say it. Sorted: Agentic System for Compositional Diagram Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15222)**  `arXiv:2508.15222`  `cs.AI` `cs.CV` `cs.MA`  
  _Hantao Zhang, Jingyang Liu, Ed Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows) without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The codebase is open-sourced atthis https URL.
