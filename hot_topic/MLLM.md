- **[Leveraging LLMs for Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Radiology Report Generation via Key Phrase Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07415)**  `arXiv:2504.07415`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL` `cs.LG`

  Automated radiology report generation (RRG) holds potential to reduce radiologists' workload, especially as recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) enable the development of multimodal models for chest X-ray (CXR) report generation. However, multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are resource-intensive, requiring vast datasets and substantial computational cost for training. To address these challenges, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation approach that leverages multimodal retrieval and LLMs to generate radiology reports while mitigating hallucinations and reducing computational demands. Our method uses LLMs to extract key phrases from radiology reports, effectively focusing on essential diagnostic information. Through exploring effective training strategies, including image encoder structure search, adding noise to text embeddings, and additional training objectives, we combine complementary pre-trained image encoders and adopt contrastive learning between text and semantic image embeddings. We evaluate our approach on MIMIC-CXR dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results on CheXbert metrics and competitive RadGraph F1 metric alongside MLLMs, without requiring LLM fine-tuning. Our method demonstrates robust generalization for multi-view RRG, making it suitable for comprehensive clinical applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inspired by the success of DeepSeek-R1, we explore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) in MLLM post-training for perception policy learning. While promising, our initial experiments reveal that incorporating a thinking process through RL does not consistently lead to performance gains across all visual perception tasks. This leads us to delve into the essential role of RL in the context of visual perception. In this work, we return to the fundamentals and explore the effects of RL on different perception tasks. We observe that the perceptual complexity is a major factor in determining the effectiveness of RL. We also observe that reward design plays a crucial role in further approching the upper limit of model perception. To leverage these findings, we propose Perception-R1, a scalable RL framework using GRPO during MLLM post-training. With a standard Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, Perception-R1 achieves +4.2% on RefCOCO+, +17.9% on PixMo-Count, +4.2% on PageOCR, and notably, 31.9% AP on COCO2017 val for the first time, establishing a strong baseline for perception policy learning.

- **[VLM-R1: A Stable and Generalizable R1-style Large Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07615)**  `arXiv:2504.07615`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Haozhan Shen, Peng Liu, Jingcheng Li, Chunxin Fang, Yibo Ma, Jiajia Liao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently DeepSeek R1 has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a simple yet effective design. The core of R1 lies in its rule-based reward formulation, which leverages tasks with deterministic ground-truth answers to enable precise and stable reward computation. In the visual domain, we similarly observe that a wide range of visual understanding tasks are inherently equipped with well-defined ground-truth annotations. This property makes them naturally compatible with rule-based reward mechanisms. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the extension of R1-style reinforcement learning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their visual reasoning capabilities. To this end, we develop VLM-R1, a dedicated framework designed to harness RL for improving VLMs' performance on general vision-language tasks. Using this framework, we further explore the feasibility of applying RL to visual domain. Experimental results indicate that the RL-based model not only delivers competitive performance on visual understanding tasks but also surpasses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in generalization ability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies that uncover a series of noteworthy insights, including the presence of reward hacking in object detection, the emergence of the "OD aha moment", the impact of training data quality, and the scaling behavior of RL across different model sizes. Through these analyses, we aim to deepen the understanding of how reinforcement learning enhances the capabilities of vision-language models, and we hope our findings and open-source contributions will support continued progress in the vision-language RL community.

- **[VCR-Bench: A Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for Video Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07956)**  `arXiv:2504.07956`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Yukun Qi, Yiming Zhao, Yu Zeng, Xikun Bao, Wenxuan Huang, Lin Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advancement of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, a rigorous evaluation framework for video CoT reasoning remains absent. Current video benchmarks fail to adequately assess the reasoning process and expose whether failures stem from deficiencies in perception or reasoning capabilities. Therefore, we introduce VCR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LVLMs' Video Chain-of-Thought Reasoning capabilities. VCR-Bench comprises 859 videos spanning a variety of video content and durations, along with 1,034 high-quality question-answer pairs. Each pair is manually annotated with a stepwise CoT rationale, where every step is tagged to indicate its association with the perception or reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we design seven distinct task dimensions and propose the CoT score to assess the entire CoT process based on the stepwise tagged CoT rationals. Extensive experiments on VCR-Bench highlight substantial limitations in current LVLMs. Even the top-performing model, o1, only achieves a 62.8% CoT score and an 56.7% accuracy, while most models score below 40%. Experiments show most models score lower on perception than reasoning steps, revealing LVLMs' key bottleneck in temporal-spatial information processing for complex video reasoning. A robust positive correlation between the CoT score and accuracy confirms the validity of our evaluation framework and underscores the critical role of CoT reasoning in solving complex video reasoning tasks. We hope VCR-Bench to serve as a standardized evaluation framework and expose the actual drawbacks in complex video reasoning task.

- **[Driving by the Rules: A Benchmark for Integrating Traffic Sign Regulations into Vectorized HD Map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23780)**  `arXiv:2410.23780`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Xinyuan Chang, Maixuan Xue, Xinran Liu, Zheng Pan, Xing Wei_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensuring adherence to traffic sign regulations is essential for both human and autonomous vehicle navigation. While current online mapping solutions often prioritize the construction of the geometric and connectivity layers of HD maps, overlooking the construction of the traffic regulation layer within HD maps. Addressing this gap, we introduce MapDR, a novel dataset designed for the extraction of Driving Rules from traffic signs and their association with vectorized, locally perceived HD Maps. MapDR features over $10,000$ annotated video clips that capture the intricate correlation between traffic sign regulations and lanes. Built upon this benchmark and the newly defined task of integrating traffic regulations into online HD maps, we provide modular and end-to-end solutions: VLE-MEE and RuleVLM, offering a strong baseline for advancing autonomous driving technology. It fills a critical gap in the integration of traffic sign rules, contributing to the development of reliable autonomous driving systems. Code is available atthis https URL.

- **[GLUS: Global-Local Reasoning Unified into A Single Large Language Model for Video Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07962)**  `arXiv:2504.07962`  `cs.CV`  
  _Lang Lin, Xueyang Yu, Ziqi Pang, Yu-Xiong Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a novel framework utilizing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for referring video object segmentation (RefVOS). Previous MLLM-based methods commonly struggle with the dilemma between "Ref" and "VOS": they either specialize in understanding a few key frames (global reasoning) or tracking objects on continuous frames (local reasoning), and rely on external VOS or frame selectors to mitigate the other end of the challenge. However, our framework GLUS shows that global and local consistency can be unified into a single video segmentation MLLM: a set of sparse "context frames" provides global information, while a stream of continuous "query frames" conducts local object tracking. This is further supported by jointly training the MLLM with a pre-trained VOS memory bank to simultaneously digest short-range and long-range temporal information. To improve the information efficiency within the limited context window of MLLMs, we introduce object contrastive learning to distinguish hard false-positive objects and a self-refined framework to identify crucial frames and perform propagation. By collectively integrating these insights, our GLUS delivers a simple yet effective baseline, achieving new state-of-the-art for MLLMs on the MeViS and Ref-Youtube-VOS benchmark.

- **[MM-IFEngine: Towards Multimodal Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07957)**  `arXiv:2504.07957`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shengyuan Ding, Shenxi Wu, Xiangyu Zhao, Yuhang Zang, Haodong Duan, Xiaoyi Dong, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Instruction Following (IF) ability measures how well Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) understand exactly what users are telling them and whether they are doing it right. Existing multimodal instruction following training data is scarce, the benchmarks are simple with atomic instructions, and the evaluation strategies are imprecise for tasks demanding exact output constraints. To address this, we present MM-IFEngine, an effective pipeline to generate high-quality image-instruction pairs. Our MM-IFEngine pipeline yields large-scale, diverse, and high-quality training data MM-IFInstruct-23k, which is suitable for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and extended as MM-IFDPO-23k for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We further introduce MM-IFEval, a challenging and diverse multi-modal instruction-following benchmark that includes (1) both compose-level constraints for output responses and perception-level constraints tied to the input images, and (2) a comprehensive evaluation pipeline incorporating both rule-based assessment and judge model. We conduct SFT and DPO experiments and demonstrate that fine-tuning MLLMs on MM-IFInstruct-23k and MM-IFDPO-23k achieves notable gains on various IF benchmarks, such as MM-IFEval (+10.2$\%$), MIA (+7.6$\%$), and IFEval (+12.3$\%$). The full data and evaluation code will be released onthis https URL.

- **[SoTA with Less: MCTS-Guided Sample Selection for Data-Efficient Visual Reasoning Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07934)**  `arXiv:2504.07934`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xiyao Wang, Zhengyuan Yang, Chao Feng, Hongjin Lu, Linjie Li, Chung-Ching Lin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present an effective method to enhance visual reasoning with significantly fewer training samples, relying purely on self-improvement with no knowledge distillation. Our key insight is that the difficulty of training data during reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is critical. Appropriately challenging samples can substantially boost reasoning capabilities even when the dataset is small. Despite being intuitive, the main challenge remains in accurately quantifying sample difficulty to enable effective data filtering. To this end, we propose a novel way of repurposing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to achieve that. Starting from our curated 70k open-source training samples, we introduce an MCTS-based selection method that quantifies sample difficulty based on the number of iterations required by the VLMs to solve each problem. This explicit step-by-step reasoning in MCTS enforces the model to think longer and better identifies samples that are genuinely challenging. We filter and retain 11k samples to perform RFT on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, resulting in our final model, ThinkLite-VL. Evaluation results on eight benchmarks show that ThinkLite-VL improves the average performance of Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by 7%, using only 11k training samples with no knowledge distillation. This significantly outperforms all existing 7B-level reasoning VLMs, and our fairly comparable baselines that use classic selection methods such as accuracy-based filtering. Notably, on MathVista, ThinkLite-VL-7B achieves the SoTA accuracy of 75.1, surpassing Qwen2.5-VL-72B, GPT-4o, and O1. Our code, data, and model are available atthis https URL.

- **[SAMJAM: Zero-Shot Video Scene Graph Generation for Egocentric Kitchen Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07867)**  `arXiv:2504.07867`  `cs.CV`  
  _Joshua Li, Fernando Jose Pena Cantu, Emily Yu, Alexander Wong, Yuchen Cui, Yuhao Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) is an important topic in understanding dynamic kitchen environments. Current models for VidSGG require extensive training to produce scene graphs. Recently, Vision Language Models (VLM) and Vision Foundation Models (VFM) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities in a variety of tasks. However, VLMs like Gemini struggle with the dynamics for VidSGG, failing to maintain stable object identities across frames. To overcome this limitation, we propose SAMJAM, a zero-shot pipeline that combines SAM2's temporal tracking with Gemini's semantic understanding. SAM2 also improves upon Gemini's object grounding by producing more accurate bounding boxes. In our method, we first prompt Gemini to generate a frame-level scene graph. Then, we employ a matching algorithm to map each object in the scene graph with a SAM2-generated or SAM2-propagated mask, producing a temporally-consistent scene graph in dynamic environments. Finally, we repeat this process again in each of the following frames. We empirically demonstrate that SAMJAM outperforms Gemini by 8.33% in mean recall on the EPIC-KITCHENS and EPIC-KITCHENS-100 datasets.

- **[TokenFocus-VQA: Enhancing Text-to-Image Alignment with Position-Aware Focus and Multi-Perspective Aggregations on LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07556)**  `arXiv:2504.07556`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zijian Zhang, Xuhui Zheng, Xuecheng Wu, Chong Peng, Xuezhi Cao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While text-to-image (T2I) generation models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years, existing evaluation methodologies for vision-language alignment still struggle with the fine-grained semantic matching. Current approaches based on global similarity metrics often overlook critical token-level correspondences between textual descriptions and visual content. To this end, we present TokenFocus-VQA, a novel evaluation framework that leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) through visual question answering (VQA) paradigm with position-specific probability optimization. Our key innovation lies in designing a token-aware loss function that selectively focuses on probability distributions at pre-defined vocabulary positions corresponding to crucial semantic elements, enabling precise measurement of fine-grained semantical alignment. The proposed framework further integrates ensemble learning techniques to aggregate multi-perspective assessments from diverse LVLMs architectures, thereby achieving further performance enhancement. Evaluated on the NTIRE 2025 T2I Quality Assessment Challenge Track 1, our TokenFocus-VQA ranks 2nd place (0.8445, only 0.0001 lower than the 1st method) on public evaluation and 2nd place (0.8426) on the official private test set, demonstrating superiority in capturing nuanced text-image correspondences compared to conventional evaluation methods.

- **[VideoExpert: Augmented LLM for Temporal-Sensitive Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07519)**  `arXiv:2504.07519`  `cs.CV`  
  _Henghao Zhao, Ge-Peng Ji, Rui Yan, Huan Xiong, Zechao Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The core challenge in video understanding lies in perceiving dynamic content changes over time. However, multimodal large language models struggle with temporal-sensitive video tasks, which requires generating timestamps to mark the occurrence of specific events. Existing strategies require MLLMs to generate absolute or relative timestamps directly. We have observed that those MLLMs tend to rely more on language patterns than visual cues when generating timestamps, affecting their performance. To address this problem, we propose VideoExpert, a general-purpose MLLM suitable for several temporal-sensitive video tasks. Inspired by the expert concept, VideoExpert integrates two parallel modules: the Temporal Expert and the Spatial Expert. The Temporal Expert is responsible for modeling time sequences and performing temporal grounding. It processes high-frame-rate yet compressed tokens to capture dynamic variations in videos and includes a lightweight prediction head for precise event localization. The Spatial Expert focuses on content detail analysis and instruction following. It handles specially designed spatial tokens and language input, aiming to generate content-related responses. These two experts collaborate seamlessly via a special token, ensuring coordinated temporal grounding and content generation. Notably, the Temporal and Spatial Experts maintain independent parameter sets. By offloading temporal grounding from content generation, VideoExpert prevents text pattern biases in timestamp predictions. Moreover, we introduce a Spatial Compress module to obtain spatial tokens. This module filters and compresses patch tokens while preserving key information, delivering compact yet detail-rich input for the Spatial Expert. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the VideoExpert.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Kimi-VL, an efficient open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model (VLM) that offers advanced multimodal reasoning, long-context understanding, and strong agent capabilities - all while activating only 2.8B parameters in its language decoder (Kimi-VL-A3B). Kimi-VL demonstrates strong performance across challenging domains: as a general-purpose VLM, Kimi-VL excels in multi-turn agent tasks (e.g., OSWorld), matching flagship models. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable capabilities across diverse challenging vision language tasks, including college-level image and video comprehension, OCR, mathematical reasoning, and multi-image understanding. In comparative evaluations, it effectively competes with cutting-edge efficient VLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, and Gemma-3-12B-IT, while surpassing GPT-4o in several key domains. Kimi-VL also advances in processing long contexts and perceiving clearly. With a 128K extended context window, Kimi-VL can process diverse long inputs, achieving impressive scores of 64.5 on LongVideoBench and 35.1 on MMLongBench-Doc. Its native-resolution vision encoder, MoonViT, further allows it to see and understand ultra-high-resolution visual inputs, achieving 83.2 on InfoVQA and 34.5 on ScreenSpot-Pro, while maintaining lower computational cost for common tasks. Building upon Kimi-VL, we introduce an advanced long-thinking variant: Kimi-VL-Thinking. Developed through long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), this model exhibits strong long-horizon reasoning capabilities. It achieves scores of 61.7 on MMMU, 36.8 on MathVision, and 71.3 on MathVista while maintaining the compact 2.8B activated LLM parameters, setting a new standard for efficient multimodal thinking models.

- **[How Can Objects Help Video-Language Understanding?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07454)**  `arXiv:2504.07454`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zitian Tang, Shijie Wang, Junho Cho, Jaewook Yoo, Chen Sun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  How multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perceive the visual world remains a mystery. To one extreme, object and relation modeling may be implicitly implemented with inductive biases, for example by treating objects as tokens. To the other extreme, empirical results reveal the surprising finding that simply performing visual captioning, which tends to ignore spatial configuration of the objects, serves as a strong baseline for video understanding. We aim to answer the question: how can objects help video-language understanding in MLLMs? We tackle the question from the object representation and adaptation perspectives. Specifically, we investigate the trade-off between representation expressiveness (e.g., distributed versus symbolic) and integration difficulty (e.g., data-efficiency when learning the adapters). Through extensive evaluations on five video question answering datasets, we confirm that explicit integration of object-centric representation remains necessary, and the symbolic objects can be most easily integrated while being performant for question answering. We hope our findings can encourage the community to explore the explicit integration of perception modules into MLLM design. Our code and models will be publicly released.

- **[Perception in Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07165)**  `arXiv:2504.07165`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yana Wei, Liang Zhao, Kangheng Lin, En Yu, Yuang Peng, Runpei Dong, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a perception in reflection paradigm designed to transcend the limitations of current large vision-language models (LVLMs), which are expected yet often fail to achieve perfect perception initially. Specifically, we propose Reflective Perception (RePer), a dual-model reflection mechanism that systematically alternates between policy and critic models, enables iterative refinement of visual perception. This framework is powered by Reflective Perceptual Learning (RPL), which reinforces intrinsic reflective capabilities through a methodically constructed visual reflection dataset and reflective unlikelihood training. Comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates RePer's quantifiable improvements in image understanding, captioning precision, and hallucination reduction. Notably, RePer achieves strong alignment between model attention patterns and human visual focus, while RPL optimizes fine-grained and free-form preference alignment. These advancements establish perception in reflection as a robust paradigm for future multimodal agents, particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning and multi-step manipulation.

  Recent advancements in reinforcement learning have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.

  _Ashim Dahal, Saydul Akbar Murad, Nick Rahimi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the representation shift on Vision Language Models like CLIP under different augmentations provides valuable insights on Mechanistic Interpretability. In this study, we show the shift on CLIP's embeddings on 9 common augmentation techniques: noise, blur, color jitter, scale and rotate, flip, elastic and perspective transforms, random brightness and contrast, and coarse dropout of pixel blocks. We scrutinize the embedding shifts under similarity on attention map, patch, edge, detail preservation, cosine similarity, L2 distance, pairwise distance and dendrogram clusters and provide qualitative analysis on sample images. Our findings suggest certain augmentations like noise, perspective transform and shift scaling have higher degree of drastic impact on embedding shift. This study provides a concrete foundation for future work on VLM's robustness for mechanical interpretation and adversarial data defense. The code implementation for this study can be found on \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

  Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable effectiveness for multi-modal tasks due to their abilities to generate and understand cross-modal data. However, processing long sequences of visual tokens extracted from visual backbones poses a challenge for deployment in real-time applications. To address this issue, we introduce FOLDER, a simple yet effective plug-and-play module designed to reduce the length of the visual token sequence, mitigating both computational and memory demands during training and inference. Through a comprehensive analysis of the token reduction process, we analyze the information loss introduced by different reduction strategies and develop FOLDER to preserve key information while removing visual redundancy. We showcase the effectiveness of FOLDER by integrating it into the visual backbone of several MLLMs, significantly accelerating the inference phase. Furthermore, we evaluate its utility as a training accelerator or even performance booster for MLLMs. In both contexts, FOLDER achieves comparable or even better performance than the original models, while dramatically reducing complexity by removing up to 70% of visual tokens.

- **[Law of Vision Representation in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16357)**  `arXiv:2408.16357`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shijia Yang, Bohan Zhai, Quanzeng You, Jianbo Yuan, Hongxia Yang, Chenfeng Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present the "Law of Vision Representation" in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It reveals a strong correlation between the combination of cross-modal alignment, correspondence in vision representation, and MLLM performance. We quantify the two factors using the cross-modal Alignment and Correspondence score (AC score). Through extensive experiments involving thirteen different vision representation settings and evaluations across eight benchmarks, we find that the AC score is linearly correlated to model performance. By leveraging this relationship, we are able to identify and train the optimal vision representation only, which does not require finetuning the language model every time, resulting in a 99.7% reduction in computational cost.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Charts are ubiquitous, as people often use them to analyze data, answer questions, and discover critical insights. However, performing complex analytical tasks with charts requires significant perceptual and cognitive effort. Chart Question Answering (CQA) systems automate this process by enabling models to interpret and reason with visual representations of data. However, existing benchmarks like ChartQA lack real-world diversity and have recently shown performance saturation with modern large vision-language models (LVLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce ChartQAPro, a new benchmark that includes 1,341 charts from 157 diverse sources, spanning various chart types, including infographics and dashboards, and featuring 1,948 questions in various types, such as multiple-choice, conversational, hypothetical, and unanswerable questions, to better reflect real-world challenges. Our evaluations with 21 models show a substantial performance drop for LVLMs on ChartQAPro; e.g., Claude Sonnet 3.5 scores 90.5% on ChartQA but only 55.81% on ChartQAPro, underscoring the complexity of chart reasoning. We complement our findings with detailed error analyses and ablation studies, identifying key challenges and opportunities for advancing LVLMs in chart understanding and reasoning. We release ChartQAPro atthis https URL.

- **[Routing to the Right Expertise: A Trustworthy Judge for Instruction-based Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07424)**  `arXiv:2504.07424`  `cs.AI`  
  _Chenxi Sun, Hongzhi Zhang, Qi Wang, Fuzheng Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Instruction-based Image Editing (IIE) models have made significantly improvement due to the progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and diffusion models, which can understand and reason about complex editing instructions. In addition to advancing current IIE models, accurately evaluating their output has become increasingly critical and challenging. Current IIE evaluation methods and their evaluation procedures often fall short of aligning with human judgment and often lack explainability. To address these limitations, we propose JUdgement through Routing of Expertise (JURE). Each expert in JURE is a pre-selected model assumed to be equipped with an atomic expertise that can provide useful feedback to judge output, and the router dynamically routes the evaluation task of a given instruction and its output to appropriate experts, aggregating their feedback into a final judge. JURE is trustworthy in two aspects. First, it can effortlessly provide explanations about its judge by examining the routed experts and their feedback. Second, experimental results demonstrate that JURE is reliable by achieving superior alignment with human judgments, setting a new standard for automated IIE evaluation. Moreover, JURE's flexible design is future-proof - modular experts can be seamlessly replaced or expanded to accommodate advancements in IIE, maintaining consistently high evaluation quality. Our evaluation data and results are available atthis https URL.
