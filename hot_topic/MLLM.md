  Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or large behavior models (LBMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those works advancing towards agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's literature.

- **[MLM: Learning Multi-task Loco-Manipulation Whole-Body Control for Quadruped Robot with Arm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10538)**  `arXiv:2508.10538`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Whole-body loco-manipulation for quadruped robots with arm remains a challenging problem, particularly in achieving multi-task control. To address this, we propose MLM, a reinforcement learning framework driven by both real-world and simulation data. It enables a six-DoF robotic arm--equipped quadruped robot to perform whole-body loco-manipulation for multiple tasks autonomously or under human teleoperation. To address the problem of balancing multiple tasks during the learning of loco-manipulation, we introduce a trajectory library with an adaptive, curriculum-based sampling mechanism. This approach allows the policy to efficiently leverage real-world collected trajectories for learning multi-task loco-manipulation. To address deployment scenarios with only historical observations and to enhance the performance of policy execution across tasks with different spatial ranges, we propose a Trajectory-Velocity Prediction policy network. It predicts unobservable future trajectories and velocities. By leveraging extensive simulation data and curriculum-based rewards, our controller achieves whole-body behaviors in simulation and zero-shot transfer to real-world deployment. Ablation studies in simulation verify the necessity and effectiveness of our approach, while real-world experiments on the Go2 robot with an Airbot robotic arm demonstrate the policy's good performance in multi-task execution.

  Reinforcement learning in large reasoning models enables learning from feedback on their outputs, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where fine-tuning data is limited. However, its application in multi-modal human activity recognition (HAR) domains remains largely underexplored. Our work extends reinforcement learning to the human activity recognition domain with multimodal large language models. By incorporating visual reinforcement learning in the training process, the model's generalization ability on few-shot recognition can be greatly improved. Additionally, visual reinforcement learning can enhance the model's reasoning ability and enable explainable analysis in the inference stage. We name our few-shot human activity recognition method with visual reinforcement learning FAVOR. Specifically, our approach first utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to generate multiple candidate responses for the human activity image, each containing reasoning traces and final answers. These responses are then evaluated using reward functions, and the MLLM model is subsequently optimized using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. In this way, the MLLM model can be adapted to human activity recognition with only a few samples. Extensive experiments on four human activity recognition datasets and five different settings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

- **[From Intent to Execution: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reinforcement Learning for Precise CAD Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10118)**  `arXiv:2508.10118`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`

  Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code executability over existing VLMs.

- **[Shuffle-R1: Efficient RL framework for Multimodal Large Language Models via Data-centric Dynamic Shuffle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05612)**  `arXiv:2508.05612`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1) Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.

- **[CapeLLM: Support-Free Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06869)**  `arXiv:2411.06869`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Junho Kim, Hyungjin Chung, Byung-Hoon Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Category-agnostic pose estimation (CAPE) has traditionally relied on support images with annotated keypoints, a process that is often cumbersome and may fail to fully capture the necessary correspondences across diverse object categories. Recent efforts have explored the use of text queries, leveraging their enhanced stability and generalization capabilities. However, existing approaches often remain constrained by their reliance on support queries, their failure to fully utilize the rich priors embedded in pre-trained large language models, and the limitations imposed by their parametric distribution assumptions. To address these challenges, we introduce CapeLLM, the first multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed for CAPE. Our method only employs query image and detailed text descriptions as an input to estimate category-agnostic keypoints. Our method encompasses effective training strategies and carefully designed instructions for applying the MLLM to CAPE. Moreover, we propose an inference mechanism that further enhances the reasoning process for unseen keypoints. while flexibly modeling their underlying spatial distribution and uncertainty, allowing for adaptive refinement based on contextual cues. We conducted extensive experiments to apply the MLLM to CAPE effectively, focusing not only on the model architecture and prompt design but also on ensuring robustness across input variations. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the MP-100 benchmark in the 1-shot and even 5-shot setting, marking a significant advancement in the field of category-agnostic pose estimation.

- **[Re:Verse -- Can Your VLM Read a Manga?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08508)**  `arXiv:2508.08508`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Aaditya Baranwal, Madhav Kataria, Naitik Agrawal, Yogesh S Rawat, Shruti Vyas_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these limitations.Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii) comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence, struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence, while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in Multimodal Models.Project Page:this https URL

- **[Evaluation of Cultural Competence of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22793)**  `arXiv:2505.22793`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Srishti Yadav, Lauren Tilton, Maria Antoniak, Taylor Arnold, Jiaang Li, Siddhesh Milind Pawar, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern vision-language models (VLMs) often fail at cultural competency evaluations and benchmarks. Given the diversity of applications built upon VLMs, there is renewed interest in understanding how they encode cultural nuances. While individual aspects of this problem have been studied, we still lack a comprehensive framework for systematically identifying and annotating the nuanced cultural dimensions present in images for VLMs. This position paper argues that foundational methodologies from visual culture studies (cultural studies, semiotics, and visual studies) are necessary for cultural analysis of images. Building upon this review, we propose a set of five frameworks, corresponding to cultural dimensions, that must be considered for a more complete analysis of the cultural competencies of VLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking and GLM-4.5V, a family of vision-language models (VLMs) designed to advance general-purpose multimodal understanding and reasoning. In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document interpretation. In a comprehensive evaluation across 42 public benchmarks, GLM-4.5V achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks among open-source models of similar size, and demonstrates competitive or even superior results compared to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on challenging tasks including Coding and GUI Agents. Meanwhile, the smaller GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking remains highly competitive-achieving superior results to the much larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B on 29 benchmarks. We open-source both GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and GLM-4.5V. Code, models and more information are released atthis https URL.

- **[CAPTURe: Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Vision Language Models via Occluded Object Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15485)**  `arXiv:2504.15485`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Atin Pothiraj, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Jaemin Cho, Mohit Bansal_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recognizing and reasoning about occluded (partially or fully hidden) objects is vital to understanding visual scenes, as occlusions frequently occur in real-world environments and act as obstacles for spatial comprehension. To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty in counting in images.

- **[EgoCross: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Cross-Domain Egocentric Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10729)**  `arXiv:2508.10729`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yanjun Li, Yuqian Fu, Tianwen Qian, Qi'ao Xu, Silong Dai, Danda Pani Paudel, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering (EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports, and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips, spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs, whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models. Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be released at: \href{this https URL}{this https URL.}

- **[AddressVLM: Cross-view Alignment Tuning for Image Address Localization using Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10667)**  `arXiv:2508.10667`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Shixiong Xu, Chenghao Zhang, Lubin Fan, Yuan Zhou, Bin Fan, Shiming Xiang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

- **[PQ-DAF: Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation for Data-scarce Driver Distraction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10397)**  `arXiv:2508.10397`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Haibin Sun, Xinghui Song_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework (PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness. Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

- **[MRFD: Multi-Region Fusion Decoding with Self-Consistency for Mitigating Hallucinations in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10264)**  `arXiv:2508.10264`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Haonan Ge, Yiwei Wang, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Yujun Cai_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without requiring model updates.

- **[A Neurosymbolic Framework for Interpretable Cognitive Attack Detection in Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09185)**  `arXiv:2508.09185`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Rongqian Chen, Allison Andreyev, Yanming Xiu, Mahdi Imani, Bin Li, Maria Gorlatova, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Augmented Reality (AR) enriches perception by overlaying virtual elements on the physical world. Due to its growing popularity, cognitive attacks that alter AR content to manipulate users' semantic perception have received increasing attention. Existing detection methods often focus on visual changes, which are restricted to pixel- or image-level processing and lack semantic reasoning capabilities, or they rely on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), which function as black-box approaches with limited interpretability. In this paper, we present CADAR, a novel neurosymbolic approach for cognitive attack detection in AR. It fuses multimodal vision-language inputs using neural VLMs to obtain a symbolic perception-graph representation, incorporating prior knowledge, salience weighting, and temporal correlations. The model then enables particle-filter based statistical reasoning -- a sequential Monte Carlo method -- to detect cognitive attacks. Thus, CADAR inherits the adaptability of pre-trained VLM and the interpretability and reasoning rigor of particle filtering. Experiments on an extended AR cognitive attack dataset show accuracy improvements of up to 10.7% over strong baselines on challenging AR attack scenarios, underscoring the promise of neurosymbolic methods for effective and interpretable cognitive attack detection.

  _Yanhui Li, Yunkang Cao, Chengliang Liu, Yuan Xiong, Xinghui Dong, Chao Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Industrial anomaly detection is a critical component of modern manufacturing, yet the scarcity of defective samples restricts traditional detection methods to scenario-specific applications. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate significant advantages in generalization capabilities, their performance in industrial anomaly detection remains limited. To address this challenge, we propose IAD-R1, a universal post-training framework applicable to VLMs of different architectures and parameter scales, which substantially enhances their anomaly detection capabilities. IAD-R1 employs a two-stage training strategy: the Perception Activation Supervised Fine-Tuning (PA-SFT) stage utilizes a meticulously constructed high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset (Expert-AD) for training, enhancing anomaly perception capabilities and establishing reasoning-to-answer correlations; the Structured Control Group Relative Policy Optimization (SC-GRPO) stage employs carefully designed reward functions to achieve a capability leap from "Anomaly Perception" to "Anomaly Interpretation". Experimental results demonstrate that IAD-R1 achieves significant improvements across 7 VLMs, the largest improvement was on the DAGM dataset, with average accuracy 43.3% higher than the 0.5B baseline. Notably, the 0.5B parameter model trained with IAD-R1 surpasses commercial models including GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-4 in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of IAD-R1. The dataset, code, and all model weights will be publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however, they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

  Spatial understanding has been a challenging task for existing Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs). Previous methods leverage large-scale MLLM finetuning to enhance MLLM's spatial understanding ability. In this paper, we present a data-efficient approach.

Our system integrates multiple tools that allow the LLM agent to conduct spatial reasoning and API tools interaction to answer the given complicated spatial question. Extensive evaluations on the 2025 AI City Challenge Physical AI Spatial Intelligence Warehouse dataset demonstrate that our system achieves high accuracy and efficiency in tasks such as object retrieval, counting, and distance estimation.

  Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding, their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs, revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task. Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning. To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

  Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across 400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in camera-ready.

  _Xiao Shi, Yangjun Ou, Zhenzhong Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot learning.

  Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across 62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g., temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1 0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks. Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks. Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage, modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results. Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner. Project page: \textcolor{brightpink}this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses, raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between their visual representations and human perception.

  Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity, abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability, especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10 accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly, our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has potential applications in digital humanities and historical research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite rapid advances, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating content inconsistent with input or established world knowledge, which correspond to faithfulness and factuality hallucinations, respectively. Prior studies primarily evaluate faithfulness hallucination at a rather coarse level (e.g., object-level) and lack fine-grained analysis. Additionally, existing benchmarks often rely on costly manual curation or reused public datasets, raising concerns about scalability and data leakage. To address these limitations, we propose an automated data construction pipeline that produces scalable, controllable, and diverse evaluation data. We also design a hierarchical hallucination induction framework with input perturbations to simulate realistic noisy scenarios. Integrating these designs, we construct SHALE, a Scalable HALlucination Evaluation benchmark designed to assess both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations via a fine-grained hallucination categorization scheme. SHALE comprises over 30K image-instruction pairs spanning 12 representative visual perception aspects for faithfulness and 6 knowledge domains for factuality, considering both clean and noisy scenarios. Extensive experiments on over 20 mainstream LVLMs reveal significant factuality hallucinations and high sensitivity to semantic perturbations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation and quantification of Similar Object Interference (SOI), a long-overlooked yet critical bottleneck in Single Object Tracking (SOT). Through controlled Online Interference Masking (OIM) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that eliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements (AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a primary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of external cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural language as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the first semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI challenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective judgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise semantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking finding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively exploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or even performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we propose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as external cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB trackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic cognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant advancement over existing VLT methods. We hope SOIBench will serve as a standardized evaluation platform to advance semantic cognitive tracking research and contribute new insights to the tracking research community.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces TBAC-UniImage, a novel unified model for multimodal understanding and generation. We achieve this by deeply integrating a pre-trained Diffusion Model, acting as a generative ladder, with a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Previous diffusion-based unified models face two primary limitations. One approach uses only the MLLM's final hidden state as the generative condition. This creates a shallow connection, as the generator is isolated from the rich, hierarchical representations within the MLLM's intermediate layers. The other approach, pretraining a unified generative architecture from scratch, is computationally expensive and prohibitive for many researchers. To overcome these issues, our work explores a new paradigm. Instead of relying on a single output, we use representations from multiple, diverse layers of the MLLM as generative conditions for the diffusion model. This method treats the pre-trained generator as a ladder, receiving guidance from various depths of the MLLM's understanding process. Consequently, TBAC-UniImage achieves a much deeper and more fine-grained unification of understanding and generation.

  Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization. Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing.

  Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive generalization across diverse video understanding tasks under zero-shot settings. However, their capabilities in high-stakes industrial domains-where recognizing both routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is essential-remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust, safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown excellent generalization abilities. However, adapting these large-scale models to downstream tasks while preserving their generalization capabilities remains challenging. Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer from two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality isolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations, we propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that establishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities, enabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge flows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early layers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts through a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of low-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific task-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper alignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations at multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain transferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further introduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient cross-modal interactions. Extensive evaluations across four tasks demonstrate HiCroPL's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on 11 benchmarks with significant improvements.

  Despite the remarkable progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they continue to face challenges in achieving competitive performance on ordinal regression (OR; a.k.a. ordinal classification). To address this issue, this paper presents OrderChain, a novel and general prompting paradigm that improves the ordinal understanding ability of MLLMs by specificity and commonality modeling. Specifically, our OrderChain consists of a set of task-aware prompts to facilitate the specificity modeling of diverse OR tasks and a new range optimization Chain-of-Thought (RO-CoT), which learns a commonality way of thinking about OR tasks by uniformly decomposing them into multiple small-range optimization subtasks. Further, we propose a category recursive division (CRD) method to generate instruction candidate category prompts to support RO-CoT automatic optimization. Comprehensive experiments show that LLaVA model with our OrderChain improves baseline LLaVA significantly on diverse OR datasets, e.g., from 47.5\% to 93.2\% accuracy on the Adience dataset for age estimation, and from 30.0\% to 85.7\% accuracy on the Diabetic Retinopathy dataset. Notably, LLaVA with our OrderChain also remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 27% on accuracy and 0.24 on MAE on the Adience dataset. To our best knowledge, our OrderChain is the first work that augments MLLMs for OR tasks, and the effectiveness is witnessed across a spectrum of OR datasets. Project Page:this https URL.

  Visual Grounding (VG) tasks, such as referring expression detection and segmentation tasks are important for linking visual entities to context, especially in complex reasoning tasks that require detailed query interpretation. This paper explores VG beyond basic perception, highlighting challenges for methods that require reasoning like human cognition. Recent advances in large language methods (LLMs) and Vision-Language methods (VLMs) have improved abilities for visual comprehension, contextual understanding, and reasoning. These methods are mainly split into end-to-end and compositional methods, with the latter offering more flexibility. Compositional approaches that integrate LLMs and foundation models show promising performance but still struggle with complex reasoning with language-based logical representations. To address these limitations, we propose NAVER, a compositional visual grounding method that integrates explicit probabilistic logic reasoning within a finite-state automaton, equipped with a self-correcting mechanism. This design improves robustness and interpretability in inference through explicit logic reasoning. Our results show that NAVER achieves SoTA performance comparing to recent end-to-end and compositional baselines. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Instruction tuning fine-tunes pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to handle real-world tasks. However, the rapid expansion of visual instruction datasets introduces data redundancy, leading to excessive computational costs. We propose a collaborative framework, DataTailor, which leverages three key principles--informativeness, uniqueness, and representativeness--for effective data selection. We argue that a valuable sample should be informative of the task, non-redundant, and represent the sample distribution (i.e., not an outlier). We further propose practical ways to score against each principle, which automatically adapts to a given dataset without tedious hyperparameter tuning. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that DataTailor achieves 101.3% of the performance of full-data fine-tuning with only 15% of the data, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining superior results. This exemplifies the "Less is More" philosophy in MLLM development. The code and data is available in this \href{this https URL}{URL}.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the realms of computer vision and natural language processing, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become indispensable tools, proficient in generating textual responses based on visual inputs. Despite their advancements, our investigation reveals a noteworthy bias: the generated content is often driven more by the inherent priors of the underlying Large Language Models (LLMs) than by the input image. Empirical experiments underscore the persistence of this bias, as MLLMs often provide confident answers even in the absence of relevant images or given incongruent visual inputs. To rectify these biases and redirect the model's focus toward visual information, we propose two simple, training-free strategies. First, for tasks such as classification or multi-choice question answering, we introduce a "Post-Hoc Debias" method using an affine calibration step to adjust the output distribution. This approach ensures uniform answer scores when the image is absent, acting as an effective regularization technique to alleviate the influence of LLM priors. For more intricate open-ended generation tasks, we extend this method to "Visual Debias Decoding", which mitigates bias by contrasting token log-probabilities conditioned on a correct image versus a meaningless one. Additionally, our investigation sheds light on the instability of MLLMs across various decoding configurations. Through systematic exploration of different settings, we achieve significant performance improvements--surpassing previously reported results--and raise concerns about the fairness of current evaluation practices. Comprehensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies in mitigating biases. These strategies not only prove beneficial in minimizing hallucinations but also contribute to the generation of more helpful and precise illustrations.

  The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events, or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation detection. The code and data have been released.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities, including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index (MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of 0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating textual rationales from large vision-language models (LVLMs) to support trainable multimodal misinformation detectors has emerged as a promising paradigm. However, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by three core challenges: (i) insufficient diversity in generated rationales, (ii) factual inaccuracies due to hallucinations, and (iii) irrelevant or conflicting content that introduces noise. We introduce DiFaR, a detector-agnostic framework that produces diverse, factual, and relevant rationales to enhance misinformation detection. DiFaR employs five chain-of-thought prompts to elicit varied reasoning traces from LVLMs and incorporates a lightweight post-hoc filtering module to select rationale sentences based on sentence-level factuality and relevance scores. Extensive experiments on four popular benchmarks demonstrate that DiFaR outperforms four baseline categories by up to 5.9% and boosts existing detectors by as much as 8.7%. Both automatic metrics and human evaluations confirm that DiFaR significantly improves rationale quality across all three dimensions.

  Quantifying the influence of individual training samples is essential for enhancing the transparency and accountability of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing data valuation methods often rely on Hessian information or model retraining, making them computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter models. In this work, we introduce For-Value, a forward-only data valuation framework that enables scalable and efficient influence estimation for both LLMs and VLMs. By leveraging the rich representations of modern foundation models, For-Value computes influence scores using a simple closed-form expression based solely on a single forward pass, thereby eliminating the need for costly gradient computations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that For-Value accurately estimates per-sample influence by capturing alignment in hidden representations and prediction errors between training and validation samples.

  Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%, and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration processes.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper, we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math 2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising generalization in mathematical reasoning.
