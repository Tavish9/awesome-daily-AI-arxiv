- **[QUART-Online: Latency-Free Large Multimodal Language Model for Quadruped Robot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15576)**  `arXiv:2412.15576`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  This paper addresses the inherent inference latency challenges associated with deploying multimodal large language models (MLLM) in quadruped vision-language-action (QUAR-VLA) tasks. Our investigation reveals that conventional parameter reduction techniques ultimately impair the performance of the language foundation model during the action instruction tuning phase, making them unsuitable for this purpose. We introduce a novel latency-free quadruped MLLM model, dubbed QUART-Online, designed to enhance inference efficiency without degrading the performance of the language foundation model. By incorporating Action Chunk Discretization (ACD), we compress the original action representation space, mapping continuous action values onto a smaller set of discrete representative vectors while preserving critical information. Subsequently, we fine-tune the MLLM to integrate vision, language, and compressed actions into a unified semantic space. Experimental results demonstrate that QUART-Online operates in tandem with the existing MLLM system, achieving real-time inference in sync with the underlying controller frequency, significantly boosting the success rate across various tasks by 65%.

- **[From Seeing to Doing: Bridging Reasoning and Decision for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08548)**  `arXiv:2505.08548`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  Achieving generalization in robotic manipulation remains a critical challenge, particularly for unseen scenarios and novel tasks. Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, while building on top of general Vision-Language Models (VLMs), still fall short of achieving robust zero-shot performance due to the scarcity and heterogeneity prevalent in embodied datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FSD (From Seeing to Doing), a novel vision-language model that generates intermediate representations through spatial relationship reasoning, providing fine-grained guidance for robotic manipulation. Our approach combines a hierarchical data pipeline for training with a self-consistency mechanism that aligns spatial coordinates with visual signals. Through extensive experiments, we comprehensively validated FSD's capabilities in both "seeing" and "doing," achieving outstanding performance across 8 benchmarks for general spatial reasoning and embodied reference abilities, as well as on our proposed more challenging benchmark VABench. We also verified zero-shot capabilities in robot manipulation, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods in both SimplerEnv and real robot settings. Experimental results show that FSD achieves 40.6% success rate in SimplerEnv and 72% success rate across 8 real-world tasks, outperforming the strongest baseline by 30%.

- **[FM-Planner: Foundation Model Guided Path Planning for Autonomous Drone Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20783)**  `arXiv:2505.20783`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Jiaping Xiao, Cheng Wen Tsao, Yuhang Zhang, Mir Feroskhan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Path planning is a critical component in autonomous drone operations, enabling safe and efficient navigation through complex environments. Recent advances in foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhanced perception and intelligent decision-making in robotics. However, their practical applicability and effectiveness in global path planning remain relatively unexplored. This paper proposes foundation model-guided path planners (FM-Planner) and presents a comprehensive benchmarking study and practical validation for drone path planning. Specifically, we first systematically evaluate eight representative LLM and VLM approaches using standardized simulation scenarios. To enable effective real-time navigation, we then design an integrated LLM-Vision planner that combines semantic reasoning with visual perception. Furthermore, we deploy and validate the proposed path planner through real-world experiments under multiple configurations. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths, limitations, and feasibility of deploying foundation models in real-world drone applications and providing practical implementations in autonomous flight.

- **[ManiTaskGen: A Comprehensive Task Generator for Benchmarking and Improving Vision-Language Agents on Embodied Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20726)**  `arXiv:2505.20726`  `cs.RO`  
  _Liu Dai, Haina Wang, Weikang Wan, Hao Su_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Building embodied agents capable of accomplishing arbitrary tasks is a core objective towards achieving embodied artificial general intelligence (E-AGI). While recent work has advanced such general robot policies, their training and evaluation are often limited to tasks within specific scenes, involving restricted instructions and scenarios. Existing benchmarks also typically rely on manual annotation of limited tasks in a few scenes. We argue that exploring the full spectrum of feasible tasks within any given scene is crucial, as they provide both extensive benchmarks for evaluation and valuable resources for agent improvement. Towards this end, we introduce ManiTaskGen, a novel system that automatically generates comprehensive, diverse, feasible mobile manipulation tasks for any given scene. The generated tasks encompass both process-based, specific instructions (e.g., "move object from X to Y") and outcome-based, abstract instructions (e.g., "clear the table"). We apply ManiTaskGen to both simulated and real-world scenes, demonstrating the validity and diversity of the generated tasks. We then leverage these tasks to automatically construct benchmarks, thoroughly evaluating the embodied decision-making capabilities of agents built upon existing vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method that utilizes ManiTaskGen tasks to enhance embodied decision-making. Overall, this work presents a universal task generation framework for arbitrary scenes, facilitating both benchmarking and improvement of embodied decision-making agents.

- **[HoPE: Hybrid of Position Embedding for Length Generalization in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20444)**  `arXiv:2505.20444`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Haoran Li, Yingjie Qin, Baoyuan Ou, Lai Xu, Ruiwen Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal tasks. However, their performance often deteriorates in long-context scenarios, particularly long videos. While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has been widely adopted for length generalization in Large Language Models (LLMs), extending vanilla RoPE to capture the intricate spatial-temporal dependencies in videos remains an unsolved challenge. Existing methods typically allocate different frequencies within RoPE to encode 3D positional information. However, these allocation strategies mainly rely on heuristics, lacking in-depth theoretical analysis. In this paper, we first study how different allocation strategies impact the long-context capabilities of VLMs. Our analysis reveals that current multimodal RoPEs fail to reliably capture semantic similarities over extended contexts. To address this issue, we propose HoPE, a Hybrid of Position Embedding designed to improve the long-context capabilities of VLMs. HoPE introduces a hybrid frequency allocation strategy for reliable semantic modeling over arbitrarily long context, and a dynamic temporal scaling mechanism to facilitate robust learning and flexible inference across diverse context lengths. Extensive experiments across four video benchmarks on long video understanding and retrieval tasks demonstrate that HoPE consistently outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness.

- **[DeCAF: Decentralized Consensus-And-Factorization for Low-Rank Adaptation of Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21382)**  `arXiv:2505.21382`  `cs.LG`  
  _Nastaran Saadati, Zhanhong Jiang, Joshua R. Waite, Shreyan Ganguly, Aditya Balu, Chinmay Hegde, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most effective, computationally tractable fine-tuning approaches for training Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). LoRA accomplishes this by freezing the pre-trained model weights and injecting trainable low-rank matrices, allowing for efficient learning of these foundation models even on edge devices. However, LoRA in decentralized settings still remains under explored, particularly for the theoretical underpinnings due to the lack of smoothness guarantee and model consensus interference (defined formally below). This work improves the convergence rate of decentralized LoRA (DLoRA) to match the rate of decentralized SGD by ensuring gradient smoothness. We also introduce DeCAF, a novel algorithm integrating DLoRA with truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD)-based matrix factorization to resolve consensus interference. Theoretical analysis shows TSVD's approximation error is bounded and consensus differences between DLoRA and DeCAF vanish as rank increases, yielding DeCAF's matching convergence rate. Extensive experiments across vision/language tasks demonstrate our algorithms outperform local training and rivals federated learning under both IID and non-IID data distributions.

- **[MLMC-based Resource Adequacy Assessment with Active Learning Trained Surrogate Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20930)**  `arXiv:2505.20930`  `cs.LG`  
  _Ruiqi Zhang, Simon H. Tindemans_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) is a flexible and effective variance reduction technique for accelerating reliability assessments of complex power system. Recently, data-driven surrogate models have been proposed as lower-level models in the MLMC framework due to their high correlation and negligible execution time once trained. However, in resource adequacy assessments, pre-labeled datasets are typically unavailable. For large-scale systems, the efficiency gains from surrogate models are often offset by the substantial time required for labeling training data. Therefore, this paper introduces a speed metric that accounts for training time in evaluating MLMC efficiency. Considering the total time budget is limited, a vote-by-committee active learning approach is proposed to reduce the required labeling calls. A case study demonstrates that, within practical variance thresholds, active learning enables significantly improved MLMC efficiency with reduced training effort, compared to regular surrogate modelling approaches.

  Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) collect and pseudo-label terabytes of multi-modal data localized to HD maps during normal fleet testing. However, identifying interesting and safety-critical scenarios from uncurated driving logs remains a significant challenge. Traditional scenario mining techniques are error-prone and prohibitively time-consuming, often relying on hand-crafted structured queries. In this work, we revisit spatio-temporal scenario mining through the lens of recent vision-language models (VLMs) to detect whether a described scenario occurs in a driving log and, if so, precisely localize it in both time and space. To address this problem, we introduce RefAV, a large-scale dataset of 10,000 diverse natural language queries that describe complex multi-agent interactions relevant to motion planning derived from 1000 driving logs in the Argoverse 2 Sensor dataset. We evaluate several referential multi-object trackers and present an empirical analysis of our baselines. Notably, we find that naively repurposing off-the-shelf VLMs yields poor performance, suggesting that scenario mining presents unique challenges.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) trained on internet-scale data achieve remarkable zero-shot detection performance on common objects like car, truck, and pedestrian. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution classes, tasks and imaging modalities not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply re-training VLMs on more visual data, we argue that one should align VLMs to new concepts with annotation instructions containing a few visual examples and rich textual descriptions. To this end, we introduce Roboflow100-VL, a large-scale collection of 100 multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly found in VLM pre-training. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on our benchmark in zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised settings, allowing for comparison across data regimes. Notably, we find that VLMs like GroundingDINO and Qwen2.5-VL achieve less than 2% zero-shot accuracy on challenging medical imaging datasets within Roboflow100-VL, demonstrating the need for few-shot concept alignment.

- **[Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models via Adaptive Attention Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21472)**  `arXiv:2505.21472`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Mehrdad Fazli, Bowen Wei, Ziwei Zhu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve impressive performance on multimodal tasks but often suffer from hallucination, and confidently describe objects or attributes not present in the image. Current inference-time interventions, while training-free, struggle to maintain accuracy in open-ended and long-form generation scenarios. We introduce the Confidence-Aware Attention Calibration (CAAC) framework to address this challenge by targeting two key biases: spatial perception bias, which distributes attention disproportionately across image tokens, and modality bias, which shifts focus from visual to textual inputs over time. CAAC employs a two-step approach: Visual-Token Calibration (VTC) to balance attention across visual tokens, and Adaptive Attention Re-Scaling (AAR) to reinforce visual grounding based on the model's confidence. This confidence-driven adjustment ensures consistent visual alignment during generation. Experiments on CHAIR, AMBER, and POPE benchmarks demonstrate that CAAC outperforms baselines, particularly in long-form generations, effectively reducing hallucination.

- **[ID-Align: RoPE-Conscious Position Remapping for Dynamic High-Resolution Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21465)**  `arXiv:2505.21465`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Bozhou Li, Wentao Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Currently, a prevalent approach for enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) performance is to encode both the high-resolution version and the thumbnail of an image simultaneously. While effective, this method generates a large number of image tokens. When combined with the widely used Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), its long-term decay property hinders the interaction between high-resolution tokens and thumbnail tokens, as well as between text and image. To address these issues, we propose ID-Align, which alleviates these problems by reordering position IDs. In this method, high-resolution tokens inherit IDs from their corresponding thumbnail token while constraining the overexpansion of positional indices. Our experiments conducted within the LLaVA-Next framework demonstrate that ID-Align achieves significant improvements, including a 6.09% enhancement on MMBench's relation reasoning tasks and notable gains across multiple benchmarks.

- **[MUSEG: Reinforcing Video Temporal Understanding via Timestamp-Aware Multi-Segment Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20715)**  `arXiv:2505.20715`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Fuwen Luo, Shengfeng Lou, Chi Chen, Ziyue Wang, Chenliang Li, Weizhou Shen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video temporal understanding is crucial for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason over events in videos. Despite recent advances in general video understanding, current MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained temporal reasoning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to address this issue recently, existing RL approaches remain limited in effectiveness. In this work, we propose MUSEG, a novel RL-based method that enhances temporal understanding by introducing timestamp-aware multi-segment grounding. MUSEG enables MLLMs to align queries with multiple relevant video segments, promoting more comprehensive temporal reasoning. To facilitate effective learning, we design a customized RL training recipe with phased rewards that progressively guides the model toward temporally grounded reasoning. Extensive experiments on temporal grounding and time-sensitive video QA tasks demonstrate that MUSEG significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across diverse temporal understanding scenarios.

- **[MMLongBench: Benchmarking Long-Context Vision-Language Models Effectively and Thoroughly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10610)**  `arXiv:2505.10610`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Zhaowei Wang, Wenhao Yu, Xiyu Ren, Jipeng Zhang, Yu Zhao, Rohit Saxena, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid extension of context windows in large vision-language models has given rise to long-context vision-language models (LCVLMs), which are capable of handling hundreds of images with interleaved text tokens in a single forward pass. In this work, we introduce MMLongBench, the first benchmark covering a diverse set of long-context vision-language tasks, to evaluate LCVLMs effectively and thoroughly. MMLongBench is composed of 13,331 examples spanning five different categories of downstream tasks, such as Visual RAG and Many-Shot ICL. It also provides broad coverage of image types, including various natural and synthetic images. To assess the robustness of the models to different input lengths, all examples are delivered at five standardized input lengths (8K-128K tokens) via a cross-modal tokenization scheme that combines vision patches and text tokens. Through a thorough benchmarking of 46 closed-source and open-source LCVLMs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current models' vision-language long-context ability. Our results show that: i) performance on a single task is a weak proxy for overall long-context capability; ii) both closed-source and open-source models face challenges in long-context vision-language tasks, indicating substantial room for future improvement; iii) models with stronger reasoning ability tend to exhibit better long-context performance. By offering wide task coverage, various image types, and rigorous length control, MMLongBench provides the missing foundation for diagnosing and advancing the next generation of LCVLMs.

  _Bryan Sangwoo Kim, Jeongsol Kim, Jong Chul Ye_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern single-image super-resolution (SISR) models deliver photo-realistic results at the scale factors on which they are trained, but collapse when asked to magnify far beyond that regime. We address this scalability bottleneck with Chain-of-Zoom (CoZ), a model-agnostic framework that factorizes SISR into an autoregressive chain of intermediate scale-states with multi-scale-aware prompts. CoZ repeatedly re-uses a backbone SR model, decomposing the conditional probability into tractable sub-problems to achieve extreme resolutions without additional training. Because visual cues diminish at high magnifications, we augment each zoom step with multi-scale-aware text prompts generated by a vision-language model (VLM). The prompt extractor itself is fine-tuned using Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a critic VLM, aligning text guidance towards human preference. Experiments show that a standard 4x diffusion SR model wrapped in CoZ attains beyond 256x enlargement with high perceptual quality and fidelity. Project Page:this https URL.

  Academic poster generation is a crucial yet challenging task in scientific communication, requiring the compression of long-context interleaved documents into a single, visually coherent page. To address this challenge, we introduce the first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation, which pairs recent conference papers with author-designed posters and evaluates outputs on (i)Visual Quality-semantic alignment with human posters, (ii)Textual Coherence-language fluency, (iii)Holistic Assessment-six fine-grained aesthetic and informational criteria scored by a VLM-as-judge, and notably (iv)PaperQuiz-the poster's ability to convey core paper content as measured by VLMs answering generated quizzes. Building on this benchmark, we propose PosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser distills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns text-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and spatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by executing rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and ensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o outputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and poor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary aesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual semantics to convey meaning. Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the Qwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across nearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens. It transforms a 22-page paper into a finalized yet editable .pptx poster - all for just $0.005. These findings chart clear directions for the next generation of fully automated poster-generation models. The code and datasets are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at general vision-language tasks, visuospatial cognition - reasoning about spatial layouts, relations, and dynamics - remains a significant challenge. Existing models often lack the necessary architectural components and specialized training data for fine-grained spatial understanding. We introduce ViCA2 (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant 2), a novel MLLM designed to enhance spatial reasoning. ViCA2 features a dual vision encoder architecture integrating SigLIP for semantics and Hiera for spatial structure, coupled with a token ratio control mechanism for efficiency. We also developed ViCA-322K, a new large-scale dataset with over 322,000 spatially grounded question-answer pairs for targeted instruction tuning. On the challenging VSI-Bench benchmark, our ViCA2-7B model achieves a state-of-the-art average score of 56.8, significantly surpassing larger open-source models (e.g., LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B, 40.9) and leading proprietary models (Gemini-1.5 Pro, 45.4). This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in achieving strong visuospatial intelligence with a compact model. We release ViCA2, its codebase, and the ViCA-322K dataset to facilitate further research.

  Video-based spatial cognition is vital for robotics and embodied AI but challenges current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning. Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling. We release all resources to foster research in robust visuospatial intelligence.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and reasoning about visual content, but significant challenges persist in tasks requiring cross-viewpoint understanding and spatial reasoning. We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Given the central role of charts in scientific, business, and communication contexts, enhancing the chart understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) has become increasingly critical. A key limitation of existing VLMs lies in their inaccurate visual grounding of infographic elements, including charts and human-recognizable objects (HROs) such as icons and images. However, chart understanding often requires identifying relevant elements and reasoning over them. To address this limitation, we introduce OrionBench, a benchmark designed to support the development of accurate object detection models for charts and HROs in infographics. It contains 26,250 real and 78,750 synthetic infographics, with over 6.9 million bounding box annotations. These annotations are created by combining the model-in-the-loop and programmatic methods. We demonstrate the usefulness of OrionBench through three applications: 1) constructing a Thinking-with-Boxes scheme to boost the chart understanding performance of VLMs, 2) comparing existing object detection models, and 3) applying the developed detection model to document layout and UI element detection.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Active vision, also known as active perception, refers to the process of actively selecting where and how to look in order to gather task-relevant information. It is a critical component of efficient perception and decision-making in humans and advanced embodied agents. Recently, the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as central planning and decision-making modules in robotic systems has gained extensive attention. However, despite the importance of active perception in embodied intelligence, there is little to no exploration of how MLLMs can be equipped with or learn active perception capabilities. In this paper, we first provide a systematic definition of MLLM-based active perception tasks. We point out that the recently proposed GPT-o3 model's zoom-in search strategy can be regarded as a special case of active perception; however, it still suffers from low search efficiency and inaccurate region selection. To address these issues, we propose ACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on top of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We further establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across both general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding, and domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote sensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive segmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot reasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit reasoning data. We hope that our work can provide a simple codebase and evaluation protocol to facilitate future research on active perception in MLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aligning large VLMs with human preferences is a challenging task, as methods like RLHF and DPO often overfit to textual information or exacerbate hallucinations. Although augmenting negative image samples partially addresses these pitfalls, no prior work has employed listwise preference optimization for VLMs, due to the complexity and cost of constructing listwise image samples. In this work, we propose LPOI, the first object-aware listwise preference optimization developed for reducing hallucinations in VLMs. LPOI identifies and masks a critical object in the image, and then interpolates the masked region between the positive and negative images to form a sequence of incrementally more complete images. The model is trained to rank these images in ascending order of object visibility, effectively reducing hallucinations while retaining visual fidelity. LPOI requires no extra annotations beyond standard pairwise preference data, as it automatically constructs the ranked lists through object masking and interpolation. Comprehensive experiments on MMHalBench, AMBER, and Object HalBench confirm that LPOI outperforms existing preference optimization methods in reducing hallucinations and enhancing VLM performance. We make the code available atthis https URL.

  Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) offer a powerful format for representing visual designs as interpretable code. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled high-quality SVG generation by framing the problem as a code generation task and leveraging large-scale pretraining. VLMs are particularly suitable for this task as they capture both global semantics and fine-grained visual patterns, while transferring knowledge across vision, natural language, and code domains. However, existing VLM approaches often struggle to produce faithful and efficient SVGs because they never observe the rendered images during training. Although differentiable rendering for autoregressive SVG code generation remains unavailable, rendered outputs can still be compared to original inputs, enabling evaluative feedback suitable for reinforcement learning (RL). We introduce RLRF(Reinforcement Learning from Rendering Feedback), an RL method that enhances SVG generation in autoregressive VLMs by leveraging feedback from rendered SVG outputs. Given an input image, the model generates SVG roll-outs that are rendered and compared to the original image to compute a reward. This visual fidelity feedback guides the model toward producing more accurate, efficient, and semantically coherent SVGs. RLRF significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning, addressing common failure modes and enabling precise, high-quality SVG generation with strong structural understanding and generalization.

  We introduce a novel self-improving framework that enhances Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT) with Visual-Language Models (VLMs) to address the limitations of current active visual tracking systems in recovering from tracking failure. Our approach combines the off-the-shelf active tracking methods with VLMs' reasoning capabilities, deploying a fast visual policy for normal tracking and activating VLM reasoning only upon failure detection. The framework features a memory-augmented self-reflection mechanism that enables the VLM to progressively improve by learning from past experiences, effectively addressing VLMs' limitations in 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements, with our framework boosting success rates by $72\%$ with state-of-the-art RL-based approaches and $220\%$ with PID-based methods in challenging environments. This work represents the first integration of VLM-based reasoning to assist EVT agents in proactive failure recovery, offering substantial advances for real-world robotic applications that require continuous target monitoring in dynamic, unstructured environments.

  With the rapid development of multimodal models, the demand for assessing video understanding capabilities has been steadily increasing. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating video understanding exhibit significant limitations in coverage, task diversity, and scene adaptability. These shortcomings hinder the accurate assessment of models' comprehensive video understanding capabilities. To tackle this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and holistic video understanding (H2VU) benchmark designed to evaluate both general video and online streaming video comprehension. This benchmark contributes three key features:Extended video duration: Spanning videos from brief 3-second clips to comprehensive 1.5-hour recordings, thereby bridging the temporal gaps found in current benchmarks. Comprehensive assessment tasks: Beyond traditional perceptual and reasoning tasks, we have introduced modules for countercommonsense comprehension and trajectory state tracking. These additions test the models' deep understanding capabilities beyond mere prior knowledge. Enriched video data: To keep pace with the rapid evolution of current AI agents, we have expanded first-person streaming video datasets. This expansion allows for the exploration of multimodal models' performance in understanding streaming videos from a first-person perspective. Extensive results from H2VU reveal that existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) possess substantial potential for improvement in our newly proposed evaluation tasks. We expect that H2VU will facilitate advancements in video understanding research by offering a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of MLLMs.

  Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to mitigate object hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By reducing over-reliance on language priors, these strategies ensure that generated content remains closely grounded in visual inputs, producing contextually accurate outputs. Since contrastive decoding requires no additional training or external tools, it offers both computational efficiency and versatility, making it highly attractive. However, these methods present two main limitations: (1) bluntly suppressing language priors can compromise coherence and accuracy of generated content, and (2) processing contrastive inputs adds computational load, significantly slowing inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF), a plug-and-play technique that enhances attention to visual signals within the model's middle layers, where modality fusion predominantly occurs. This approach enables more effective capture of visual features, reducing the model's bias toward language modality. Experimental results demonstrate that VAF significantly reduces hallucinations across various MLLMs without affecting inference speed, while maintaining coherence and accuracy in generated outputs.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have showcased exceptional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning ability in complex textual inference tasks including causal reasoning. However, will these causalities remain straightforward when crucial hints hide in visual details? If not, what factors might influence cross-modal generalization? Whether we can effectively enhance their capacity for robust causal inference across both text and vision? Motivated by these, we introduce MuCR - a novel Multimodal Causal Reasoning benchmark that leverages synthetic siamese images and text pairs to challenge MLLMs. Additionally, we develop tailored metrics from multiple perspectives, including image-level match, phrase-level understanding, and sentence-level explanation, to comprehensively assess MLLMs' comprehension abilities. Our experiments reveal that current MLLMs fall short in multimodal causal reasoning compared to their performance in purely textual settings. Additionally, we find that identifying visual cues across images is key to effective cross-modal generalization. Finally, we propose a VcCoT strategy that better highlights visual cues, and our results confirm its efficacy in enhancing multimodal causal reasoning. The project is available at:this https URL

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain vulnerable to transferable adversarial examples. While existing methods typically achieve targeted attacks by aligning global features-such as CLIP's [CLS] token-between adversarial and target samples, they often overlook the rich local information encoded in patch tokens. This leads to suboptimal alignment and limited transferability, particularly for closed-source models. To address this limitation, we propose a targeted transferable adversarial attack method based on feature optimal alignment, called FOA-Attack, to improve adversarial transfer capability. Specifically, at the global level, we introduce a global feature loss based on cosine similarity to align the coarse-grained features of adversarial samples with those of target samples. At the local level, given the rich local representations within Transformers, we leverage clustering techniques to extract compact local patterns to alleviate redundant local features. We then formulate local feature alignment between adversarial and target samples as an optimal transport (OT) problem and propose a local clustering optimal transport loss to refine fine-grained feature alignment. Additionally, we propose a dynamic ensemble model weighting strategy to adaptively balance the influence of multiple models during adversarial example generation, thereby further improving transferability. Extensive experiments across various models demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially in transferring to closed-source MLLMs. The code is released atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in CoT reasoning and RL post-training have been reported to enhance video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. This progress naturally raises a question: can these models perform complex video reasoning in a manner comparable to human experts? However, existing video benchmarks primarily evaluate visual perception and grounding abilities, with questions that can be answered based on explicit prompts or isolated visual cues. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the intricacies of real-world reasoning, where humans must actively search for, integrate, and analyze multiple clues before reaching a conclusion. To address this issue, we present Video-Holmes, a benchmark inspired by the reasoning process of Sherlock Holmes, designed to evaluate the complex video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Video-Holmes consists of 1,837 questions derived from 270 manually annotated suspense short films, which spans seven carefully designed tasks. Each task is constructed by first identifying key events and causal relationships within films, and then designing questions that require models to actively locate and connect multiple relevant visual clues scattered across different video segments. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals that, while these models generally excel at visual perception, they encounter substantial difficulties with integrating information and often miss critical clues. For example, the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves an accuracy of only 45%, with most models scoring below 40%. We aim that Video-Holmes can serve as a "Holmes-test" for multimodal reasoning, motivating models to reason more like humans and emphasizing the ongoing challenges in this field. The benchmark is released inthis https URL.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable accuracy in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from static images. However, their efficacy in video OCR is significantly diminished due to factors such as motion blur, temporal variations, and visual effects inherent in video content. To provide clearer guidance for training practical MLLMs, we introduce the MME-VideoOCR benchmark, which encompasses a comprehensive range of video OCR application scenarios. MME-VideoOCR features 10 task categories comprising 25 individual tasks and spans 44 diverse scenarios. These tasks extend beyond text recognition to incorporate deeper comprehension and reasoning of textual content within videos. The benchmark consists of 1,464 videos with varying resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, along with 2,000 meticulously curated, manually annotated question-answer pairs. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs on MME-VideoOCR, revealing that even the best-performing model (Gemini-2.5 Pro) achieves an accuracy of only 73.7%. Fine-grained analysis indicates that while existing MLLMs demonstrate strong performance on tasks where relevant texts are contained within a single or few frames, they exhibit limited capability in effectively handling tasks that demand holistic video comprehension. These limitations are especially evident in scenarios that require spatio-temporal reasoning, cross-frame information integration, or resistance to language prior bias. Our findings also highlight the importance of high-resolution visual input and sufficient temporal coverage for reliable OCR in dynamic video scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current VLM-based VQA methods often process entire images, leading to excessive visual tokens that include redundant information irrelevant to the posed question. This abundance of unnecessary image details creates numerous visual tokens, drastically increasing memory and computational requirements in VLMs. To address this, we propose Contextual Region-Oriented Visual Token Pruning (CROP), a novel framework to compress visual tokens through a two-step process: Localization and Pruning. Specifically, CROP first employs an efficient model to identify the contextual region relevant to the input query. Subsequently, two distinct strategies are introduced for pruning: (1) Pre-LLM Compression (PLC), which adaptively compresses different image regions with varying ratios, and (2) Inner-LLM Pruning (ILP), a training-free method that prunes tokens within early LLM layers guided by the identified contextual region. Extensive experiments on a wide range of VQA tasks demonstrate that CROP significantly outperforms existing visual token pruning methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code and datasets will be made available.

  Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made great achievements in Earth vision. However, complex disaster scenes with diverse disaster types, geographic regions, and satellite sensors have posed new challenges for VLM applications. To fill this gap, we curate a remote sensing vision-language dataset (DisasterM3) for global-scale disaster assessment and response. DisasterM3 includes 26,988 bi-temporal satellite images and 123k instruction pairs across 5 continents, with three characteristics: 1) Multi-hazard: DisasterM3 involves 36 historical disaster events with significant impacts, which are categorized into 10 common natural and man-made disasters. 2)Multi-sensor: Extreme weather during disasters often hinders optical sensor imaging, making it necessary to combine Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for post-disaster scenes. 3) Multi-task: Based on real-world scenarios, DisasterM3 includes 9 disaster-related visual perception and reasoning tasks, harnessing the full potential of VLM's reasoning ability with progressing from disaster-bearing body recognition to structural damage assessment and object relational reasoning, culminating in the generation of long-form disaster reports. We extensively evaluated 14 generic and remote sensing VLMs on our benchmark, revealing that state-of-the-art models struggle with the disaster tasks, largely due to the lack of a disaster-specific corpus, cross-sensor gap, and damage object counting insensitivity. Focusing on these issues, we fine-tune four VLMs using our dataset and achieve stable improvements across all tasks, with robust cross-sensor and cross-disaster generalization capabilities.

  Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential for comprehensive 3D scene understanding. However, existing approaches typically utilize only one or a limited subset of 3D modalities, resulting in incomplete representations of 3D scenes and reduced interpretive accuracy. Furthermore, different types of queries inherently depend on distinct modalities, indicating that uniform processing of all modality tokens may fail to effectively capture query-specific context. To address these challenges, we propose Uni3D-MoE, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based 3D MLLM designed to enable adaptive 3D multimodal fusion. Specifically, Uni3D-MoE integrates a comprehensive set of 3D modalities, including multi-view RGB and depth images, bird's-eye-view (BEV) maps, point clouds, and voxel representations. At its core, our framework employs a learnable routing mechanism within the sparse MoE-based large language model, dynamically selecting appropriate experts at the token level. Each expert specializes in processing multimodal tokens based on learned modality preferences, thus facilitating flexible collaboration tailored to diverse task-specific requirements. Extensive evaluations on standard 3D scene understanding benchmarks and specialized datasets demonstrate the efficacy of Uni3D-MoE.

  _Chaeyoung Jung, Youngjoon Jang, Joon Son Chung_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucination remains a major challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this, various contrastive decoding (CD) methods have been proposed that contrasts original logits with hallucinated logits generated from perturbed inputs. While CD has shown promise in vision-language models (VLMs), it is not well-suited for AV-LLMs, where hallucinations often emerge from both unimodal and cross-modal combinations involving audio, video, and language. These intricate interactions call for a more adaptive and modality-aware decoding strategy. In this paper, we propose Audio-Visual Contrastive Decoding (AVCD)-a novel, training-free decoding framework designed to model trimodal interactions and suppress modality-induced hallucinations in AV-LLMs. Unlike previous CD methods in VLMs that corrupt a fixed modality, AVCD leverages attention distributions to dynamically identify less dominant modalities and applies attentive masking to generate perturbed output logits. To support CD in a trimodal setting, we also reformulate the original CD framework to jointly handle audio, visual, and textual inputs. Finally, to improve efficiency, we introduce entropy-guided adaptive decoding, which selectively skips unnecessary decoding steps based on the model's confidence in its predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AVCD consistently outperforms existing decoding methods. Especially, on the AVHBench dataset, it improves accuracy by 6% for VideoLLaMA2 and 11% for video-SALMONN, demonstrating strong robustness and generalizability.

  DeepSeek R1 has significantly advanced complex reasoning for large language models (LLMs). While recent methods have attempted to replicate R1's reasoning capabilities in multimodal settings, they face limitations, including inconsistencies between reasoning and final answers, model instability and crashes during long-chain exploration, and low data learning efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose TACO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for visual reasoning. Building on Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization (GRPO), TACO introduces Think-Answer Consistency, which tightly couples reasoning with answer consistency to ensure answers are grounded in thoughtful reasoning. We also introduce the Rollback Resample Strategy, which adaptively removes problematic samples and reintroduces them to the sampler, enabling stable long-chain exploration and future learning opportunities. Additionally, TACO employs an adaptive learning schedule that focuses on moderate difficulty samples to optimize data efficiency. Furthermore, we propose the Test-Time-Resolution-Scaling scheme to address performance degradation due to varying resolutions during reasoning while balancing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks for REC and VQA tasks show that fine-tuning LVLMs leads to significant performance improvements.

  User-Centric Embodied Visual Tracking (UC-EVT) presents a novel challenge for reinforcement learning-based models due to the substantial gap between high-level user instructions and low-level agent actions. While recent advancements in language models (e.g., LLMs, VLMs, VLAs) have improved instruction comprehension, these models face critical limitations in either inference speed (LLMs, VLMs) or generalizability (VLAs) for UC-EVT tasks. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Hierarchical Instruction-aware Embodied Visual Tracking (HIEVT)} agent, which bridges instruction comprehension and action generation using \textit{spatial goals} as intermediaries. HIEVT first introduces \textit{LLM-based Semantic-Spatial Goal Aligner} to translate diverse human instructions into spatial goals that directly annotate the desired spatial position. Then the \textit{RL-based Adaptive Goal-Aligned Policy}, a general offline policy, enables the tracker to position the target as specified by the spatial goal. To benchmark UC-EVT tasks, we collect over ten million trajectories for training and evaluate across one seen environment and nine unseen challenging environments. Extensive experiments and real-world deployments demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of HIEVT across diverse environments, varying target dynamics, and complex instruction combinations.

  Autonomous driving requires real-time, robust reasoning across perception, prediction, planning, and behavior. However, conventional end-to-end models fail to generalize in complex scenarios due to the lack of structured reasoning. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have been applied to driving tasks, but they typically rely on isolated modules and static supervision, limiting their ability to support multi-stage decision-making. We present AutoDriveRL, a unified training framework that formulates autonomous driving as a structured reasoning process over four core tasks. Each task is independently modeled as a vision-language question-answering problem and optimized using task-specific reward models, enabling fine-grained reinforcement signals at different reasoning stages. Within this framework, we train DriveRX, a cross-task reasoning VLM designed for real-time decision-making. DriveRX achieves strong performance on a public benchmark, outperforming GPT-4o in behavior reasoning and demonstrating robustness under complex or corrupted driving conditions. Our analysis further highlights the impact of vision encoder design and reward-guided reasoning compression. We will release the AutoDriveRL framework and the DriveRX model to support future research.

  Open-Ended object Detection (OED) is a novel and challenging task that detects objects and generates their category names in a free-form manner, without requiring additional vocabularies during inference. However, the existing OED models, such as GenerateU, require large-scale datasets for training, suffer from slow convergence, and exhibit limited performance. To address these issues, we present a novel and efficient Open-Det framework, consisting of four collaborative parts. Specifically, Open-Det accelerates model training in both the bounding box and object name generation process by reconstructing the Object Detector and the Object Name Generator. To bridge the semantic gap between Vision and Language modalities, we propose a Vision-Language Aligner with V-to-L and L-to-V alignment mechanisms, incorporating with the Prompts Distiller to transfer knowledge from the VLM into VL-prompts, enabling accurate object name generation for the LLM. In addition, we design a Masked Alignment Loss to eliminate contradictory supervision and introduce a Joint Loss to enhance classification, resulting in more efficient training. Compared to GenerateU, Open-Det, using only 1.5% of the training data (0.077M vs. 5.077M), 20.8% of the training epochs (31 vs. 149), and fewer GPU resources (4 V100 vs. 16 A100), achieves even higher performance (+1.0% in APr).

We introduce MMPerspective, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' understanding of perspective through 10 carefully crafted tasks across three complementary dimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. Our benchmark comprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083 question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point perception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship understanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving transformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence on surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning and maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis further reveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective capabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting. MMPerspective establishes a valuable testbed for diagnosing and advancing spatial understanding in vision-language systems. Resources available at:this https URL

  Referring Multi-object tracking (RMOT) is an important research field in computer vision. Its task form is to guide the models to track the objects that conform to the language instruction. However, the RMOT task commonly requires clear language instructions, such methods often fail to work when complex language instructions with reasoning characteristics appear. In this work, we propose a new task, called Reasoning-based Multi-Object Tracking (ReaMOT). ReaMOT is a more challenging task that requires accurate reasoning about objects that match the language instruction with reasoning characteristic and tracking the objects' trajectories. To advance the ReaMOT task and evaluate the reasoning capabilities of tracking models, we construct ReaMOT Challenge, a reasoning-based multi-object tracking benchmark built upon 12 datasets. Specifically, it comprises 1,156 language instructions with reasoning characteristic, 423,359 image-language pairs, and 869 diverse scenes, which is divided into three levels of reasoning difficulty. In addition, we propose a set of evaluation metrics tailored for the ReaMOT task. Furthermore, we propose ReaTrack, a training-free framework for reasoning-based multi-object tracking based on large vision-language models (LVLM) and SAM2, as a baseline for the ReaMOT task. Extensive experiments on the ReaMOT Challenge benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our ReaTrack framework.

  Recent advancements in image-to-video (I2V) generation have shown promising performance in conventional scenarios. However, these methods still encounter significant challenges when dealing with complex scenes that require a deep understanding of nuanced motion and intricate object-action relationships. To address these challenges, we present Dynamic-I2V, an innovative framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to jointly encode visual and textual conditions for a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture. By leveraging the advanced multimodal understanding capabilities of MLLMs, our model significantly improves motion controllability and temporal coherence in synthesized videos. The inherent multimodality of Dynamic-I2V further enables flexible support for diverse conditional inputs, extending its applicability to various downstream generation tasks. Through systematic analysis, we identify a critical limitation in current I2V benchmarks: a significant bias towards favoring low-dynamic videos, stemming from an inadequate balance between motion complexity and visual quality metrics. To resolve this evaluation gap, we propose DIVE - a novel assessment benchmark specifically designed for comprehensive dynamic quality measurement in I2V generation. In conclusion, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm that Dynamic-I2V attains state-of-the-art performance in image-to-video generation, particularly revealing significant improvements of 42.5%, 7.9%, and 11.8% in dynamic range, controllability, and quality, respectively, as assessed by the DIVE metric in comparison to existing methods.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently been integrated into multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks to address the challenge of few-shot, weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). A key trend involves leveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue structures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales (e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x) visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2) heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly correlated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast, lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate the value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment for efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data.

  The rapid advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced capabilities in Document Understanding. However, prevailing benchmarks like DocVQA and ChartQA predominantly comprise \textit{scanned or digital} documents, inadequately reflecting the intricate challenges posed by diverse real-world scenarios, such as variable illumination and physical distortions. This paper introduces WildDoc, the inaugural benchmark designed specifically for assessing document understanding in natural environments. WildDoc incorporates a diverse set of manually captured document images reflecting real-world conditions and leverages document sources from established benchmarks to facilitate comprehensive comparisons with digital or scanned documents. Further, to rigorously evaluate model robustness, each document is captured four times under different conditions. Evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs on WildDoc expose substantial performance declines and underscore the models' inadequate robustness compared to traditional benchmarks, highlighting the unique challenges posed by real-world document understanding.

- **[Selftok: Discrete Visual Tokens of Autoregression, by Diffusion, and for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07538)**  `arXiv:2505.07538`  `cs.CV`  
  _Bohan Wang, Zhongqi Yue, Fengda Zhang, Shuo Chen, Li'an Bi, Junzhe Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We completely discard the conventional spatial prior in image representation and introduce a novel discrete visual tokenizer: Self-consistency Tokenizer (Selftok). At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior -- mirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the reverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok fundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key ways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion and AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok tokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture -- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training objectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman equation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports reinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable to that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA tokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality reconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for both visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any text-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual tokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all the existing models by a large margin. Therefore, we believe that Selftok effectively addresses the long-standing challenge that visual tokens cannot support effective RL. When combined with the well-established strengths of RL in LLMs, this brings us one step closer to realizing a truly multimodal LLM. Project Page:this https URL.

- **[NoisyRollout: Reinforcing Visual Reasoning with Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13055)**  `arXiv:2504.13055`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xiangyan Liu, Jinjie Ni, Zijian Wu, Chao Du, Longxu Dou, Haonan Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have strengthened the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, enhancing policy exploration to better scale test-time compute remains largely underexplored. In addition, VLMs continue to struggle with imperfect visual perception, which in turn affects the subsequent reasoning process. To this end, we propose NoisyRollout, a simple yet effective data augmentation method that mixes trajectories from both clean and moderately distorted images during RL training. By injecting targeted diversity in visual perception and the resulting reasoning patterns, NoisyRollout promotes better policy exploration through vision-oriented inductive biases, ultimately leading to more robust reasoning behaviors. We further adopt a noise annealing schedule that gradually reduces distortion strength over training, leveraging noisy signals early on while ensuring training stability in later stages. Crucially, our method is easy-to-adopt--requiring no additional training cost and no modifications to the RL objective. Extensive experiments on $2$ distinct training datasets demonstrate that NoisyRollout achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source RL-tuned models across $5$ out-of-domain reasoning and perception benchmarks. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of NoisyRollout across model sizes ($7$B and $32$B) and data scales (from $1$K to $6$K), highlighting its generalizability and scalability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in LVLMs have improved vision-language understanding, but they still struggle with spatial perception, limiting their ability to reason about complex 3D scenes. Unlike previous approaches that incorporate 3D representations into models to improve spatial understanding, we aim to unlock the potential of VLMs by leveraging spatially relevant image data. To this end, we introduce a novel 2D spatial data generation and annotation pipeline built upon scene data with 3D ground-truth. This pipeline enables the creation of a diverse set of spatial tasks, ranging from basic perception tasks to more complex reasoning tasks. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct SPAR-7M, a large-scale dataset generated from thousands of scenes across multiple public datasets. In addition, we introduce SPAR-Bench, a benchmark designed to offer a more comprehensive evaluation of spatial capabilities compared to existing spatial benchmarks, supporting both single-view and multi-view inputs. Training on both SPAR-7M and large-scale 2D datasets enables our models to achieve state-of-the-art performance on 2D spatial benchmarks. Further fine-tuning on 3D task-specific datasets yields competitive results, underscoring the effectiveness of our dataset in enhancing spatial reasoning.

- **[How Do Multimodal Large Language Models Handle Complex Multimodal Reasoning? Placing Them in An Extensible Escape Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10042)**  `arXiv:2503.10042`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ziyue Wang, Yurui Dong, Fuwen Luo, Minyuan Ruan, Zhili Cheng, Chi Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancing of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has spurred interest in complex multimodal reasoning tasks in the real-world and virtual environment, which require coordinating multiple abilities, including visual perception, visual reasoning, spatial awareness, and target deduction. However, existing evaluations primarily assess the final task completion, often degrading assessments to isolated abilities such as visual grounding and visual question answering. Less attention is given to comprehensively and quantitatively analyzing reasoning process in multimodal environments, which is crucial for understanding model behaviors and underlying reasoning mechanisms beyond merely task success. To address this, we introduce MM-Escape, an extensible benchmark for investigating multimodal reasoning, inspired by real-world escape games. MM-Escape emphasizes intermediate model behaviors alongside final task completion. To achieve this, we develop EscapeCraft, a customizable and open environment that enables models to engage in free-form exploration for assessing multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments show that MLLMs, regardless of scale, can successfully complete the simplest room escape tasks, with some exhibiting human-like exploration strategies. Yet, performance dramatically drops as task difficulty increases. Moreover, we observe that performance bottlenecks vary across models, revealing distinct failure modes and limitations in their multimodal reasoning abilities, such as repetitive trajectories without adaptive exploration, getting stuck in corners due to poor visual spatial awareness, and ineffective use of acquired props, such as the key. We hope our work sheds light on new challenges in multimodal reasoning, and uncovers potential improvements in MLLMs capabilities.

  _Yunhao Gou, Hansi Yang, Zhili Liu, Kai Chen, Yihan Zeng, Lanqing Hong, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) aims to enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet its effectiveness is often compromised by corrupted datasets with issues such as hallucinated content, incorrect responses, and poor OCR quality. Previous approaches to address these challenges have focused on refining datasets through high-quality data collection or rule-based filtering that can be costly or limited in scope. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into the impact of corrupted data on MLLMs and discover that, although corrupted data degrade model performance, such adverse effects are largely reversible, and MLLMs are {\bf corrupted but not broken}. Specifically, we find that disabling a small subset of parameters can almost fully restore performance. Moreover, corrupted MLLMs inherently possess the capability to differentiate between clean and corrupted samples, facilitating dataset cleaning without external intervention. Building on these insights, we introduce a corruption-robust training paradigm that significantly surpasses existing strategies for mitigating the effects of corrupted data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate spatial reasoning in outdoor environments - covering geometry, object pose, and inter-object relationships - is fundamental to downstream tasks such as mapping, motion forecasting, and high-level planning in autonomous driving. We introduce SURDS, a large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision language models (VLMs). Built on the nuScenes dataset, SURDS comprises 41,080 vision-question-answer training instances and 9,250 evaluation samples, spanning six spatial categories: orientation, depth estimation, pixel-level localization, pairwise distance, lateral ordering, and front-behind relations. We benchmark leading general-purpose VLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen, revealing persistent limitations in fine-grained spatial understanding. To address these deficiencies, we go beyond static evaluation and explore whether alignment techniques can improve spatial reasoning performance. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning-based alignment scheme leveraging spatially grounded reward signals - capturing both perception-level accuracy (location) and reasoning consistency (logic). We further incorporate final-answer correctness and output-format rewards to guide fine-grained policy adaptation. Our GRPO-aligned variant achieves an overall score of 40.80 in the SURDS benchmark. Notably, it outperforms proprietary systems such as GPT-4o (13.30) and Gemini-2.0-flash (35.71). To our best knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that reinforcement learning-based alignment can significantly and consistently enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in real-world driving contexts. We release the SURDS benchmark, evaluation toolkit, and GRPO alignment code through:this https URL.

  _Han Xiao, Guozhi Wang, Yuxiang Chai, Zimu Lu, Weifeng Lin, Hao He, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce UI-Genie, a self-improving framework addressing two key challenges in GUI agents: verification of trajectory outcome is challenging and high-quality training data are not scalable. These challenges are addressed by a reward model and a self-improving pipeline, respectively. The reward model, UI-Genie-RM, features an image-text interleaved architecture that efficiently pro- cesses historical context and unifies action-level and task-level rewards. To sup- port the training of UI-Genie-RM, we develop deliberately-designed data genera- tion strategies including rule-based verification, controlled trajectory corruption, and hard negative mining. To address the second challenge, a self-improvement pipeline progressively expands solvable complex GUI tasks by enhancing both the agent and reward models through reward-guided exploration and outcome verification in dynamic environments. For training the model, we generate UI- Genie-RM-517k and UI-Genie-Agent-16k, establishing the first reward-specific dataset for GUI agents while demonstrating high-quality synthetic trajectory gen- eration without manual annotation. Experimental results show that UI-Genie achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple GUI agent benchmarks with three generations of data-model self-improvement. We open-source our complete framework implementation and generated datasets to facilitate further research inthis https URL.

- **[A Stereotype Content Analysis on Color-related Social Bias in Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20901)**  `arXiv:2505.20901`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Junhyuk Choi, Minju Kim, Yeseon Hong, Bugeun Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large vision language models(LVLMs) rapidly advance, concerns about their potential to learn and generate social biases and stereotypes are increasing. Previous studies on LVLM's stereotypes face two primary limitations: metrics that overlooked the importance of content words, and datasets that overlooked the effect of color. To address these limitations, this study introduces new evaluation metrics based on the Stereotype Content Model (SCM). We also propose BASIC, a benchmark for assessing gender, race, and color stereotypes. Using SCM metrics and BASIC, we conduct a study with eight LVLMs to discover stereotypes. As a result, we found three findings. (1) The SCM-based evaluation is effective in capturing stereotypes. (2) LVLMs exhibit color stereotypes in the output along with gender and race ones. (3) Interaction between model architecture and parameter sizes seems to affect stereotypes. We release BASIC publicly on [anonymized for review].

  _Taiqiang Wu, Runming Yang, Jiayi Li, Pengfei Hu, Ngai Wong, Yujiu Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) consistently benefit from further fine-tuning on various tasks. However, we observe that directly tuning the INSTRUCT (i.e., instruction tuned) models often leads to marginal improvements and even performance degeneration. Notably, paired BASE models, the foundation for these INSTRUCT variants, contain highly similar weight values (i.e., less than 2% on average for Llama 3.1 8B). Therefore, we propose a novel Shadow-FT framework to tune the INSTRUCT models by leveraging the corresponding BASE models. The key insight is to fine-tune the BASE model, and then directly graft the learned weight updates to the INSTRUCT model. Our proposed Shadow-FT introduces no additional parameters, is easy to implement, and significantly improves performance. We conduct extensive experiments on tuning mainstream LLMs, such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3 series, and evaluate them across 19 benchmarks covering coding, reasoning, and mathematical tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Shadow-FT consistently outperforms conventional full-parameter and parameter-efficient tuning approaches. Further analyses indicate that Shadow-FT can be applied to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and combined with direct preference optimization (DPO). Codes and weights are available at \href{this https URL}{Github}.

  _Kun Huang, Weikai Xu, Yuxuan Liu, Quandong Wang, Pengzhi Gao, Wei Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Chain of Action-Planning Thoughts (CoaT) paradigm has been shown to improve the reasoning performance of VLM-based mobile agents in GUI tasks. However, the scarcity of diverse CoaT trajectories limits the expressiveness and generalization ability of such agents. While self-training is commonly employed to address data scarcity, existing approaches either overlook the correctness of intermediate reasoning steps or depend on expensive process-level annotations to construct process reward models (PRM). To address the above problems, we propose an Iterative Preference Learning (IPL) that constructs a CoaT-tree through interative sampling, scores leaf nodes using rule-based reward, and backpropagates feedback to derive Thinking-level Direct Preference Optimization (T-DPO) pairs. To prevent overfitting during warm-up supervised fine-tuning, we further introduce a three-stage instruction evolution, which leverages GPT-4o to generate diverse Q\&A pairs based on real mobile UI screenshots, enhancing both generality and layout understanding. Experiments on three standard Mobile GUI-agent benchmarks demonstrate that our agent MobileIPL outperforms strong baselines, including continual pretraining models such as OS-ATLAS and UI-TARS. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across three standard Mobile GUI-Agents benchmarks and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain scenarios.

  Recent progress in Machine Unlearning (MU) has introduced solutions for the selective removal of private or sensitive information encoded within deep neural networks. Nonetheless, MU for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains in its nascent phase. Therefore, we propose to reformulate the task of multimodal MU in the era of MLLMs, which aims to erase only the visual patterns associated with a given entity while preserving the corresponding textual knowledge encoded within the original parameters of the language model backbone. Furthermore, we develop a novel geometry-constrained gradient ascent method MMUnlearner. It updates the weights of MLLMs with a weight saliency map jointly restricted by the remaining concepts and textual knowledge during unlearning, thereby preserving parameters essential for non-target knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMUnlearner surpasses baselines that finetuning MLLMs with VQA data directly through Gradient Ascent (GA) or Negative Preference Optimization (NPO), across all evaluation dimensions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is increasingly expensive, as the growing size and cross-modality complexity of benchmarks demand significant scoring efforts. To tackle with this difficulty, we introduce AutoJudger, an agent-driven framework for efficient and adaptive benchmarking of MLLMs that tackles this escalating cost. AutoJudger employs the Item Response Theory (IRT) to estimate the question difficulty and an autonomous evaluation agent to dynamically select the most informative test questions based on the model's real-time performance. Specifically, AutoJudger incorporates two pivotal components: a semantic-aware retrieval mechanism to ensure that selected questions cover diverse and challenging scenarios across both vision and language modalities, and a dynamic memory that maintains contextual statistics of previously evaluated questions to guide coherent and globally informed question selection throughout the evaluation process. Extensive experiments on four representative multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive framework dramatically reduces evaluation expenses, i.e. AutoJudger uses only 4% of the data to achieve over 90% ranking accuracy with the full benchmark evaluation on MMT-Bench.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex tasks with multimodal context. However, it is still understudied whether they exhibit modality preference when processing multimodal contexts. To study this question, we first build a \textbf{MC\textsuperscript{2}} benchmark under controlled evidence conflict scenarios to systematically evaluate modality preference, which is the tendency to favor one modality over another when making decisions based on multimodal conflicting evidence. Our extensive evaluation reveals that all 18 tested MLLMs generally demonstrate clear modality bias, and modality preference can be influenced by external interventions. An in-depth analysis reveals that the preference direction can be captured within the latent representations of MLLMs. Built on this, we propose a probing and steering method based on representation engineering to explicitly control modality preference without additional fine-tuning or carefully crafted prompts. Our method effectively amplifies modality preference toward a desired direction and applies to downstream tasks such as hallucination mitigation and multimodal machine translation, yielding promising improvements.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present a comprehensive and systematic analysis of vision-language models (VLMs) for disparate meme classification tasks. We introduced a novel approach that generates a VLM-based understanding of meme images and fine-tunes the LLMs on textual understanding of the embedded meme text for improving the performance. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Benchmarking VLMs with diverse prompting strategies purposely to each sub-task; (2) Evaluating LoRA fine-tuning across all VLM components to assess performance gains; and (3) Proposing a novel approach where detailed meme interpretations generated by VLMs are used to train smaller language models (LLMs), significantly improving classification. The strategy of combining VLMs with LLMs improved the baseline performance by 8.34%, 3.52% and 26.24% for sarcasm, offensive and sentiment classification, respectively. Our results reveal the strengths and limitations of VLMs and present a novel strategy for meme understanding.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in multimodal question answering have primarily focused on combining heterogeneous modalities or fine-tuning multimodal large language models. While these approaches have shown strong performance, they often rely on a single, generalized reasoning strategy, overlooking the unique characteristics of each modality ultimately limiting both accuracy and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose MAMMQA, a multi-agent QA framework for multimodal inputs spanning text, tables, and images. Our system includes two Visual Language Model (VLM) agents and one text-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The first VLM decomposes the user query into sub-questions and sequentially retrieves partial answers from each modality. The second VLM synthesizes and refines these results through cross-modal reasoning. Finally, the LLM integrates the insights into a cohesive answer. This modular design enhances interpretability by making the reasoning process transparent and allows each agent to operate within its domain of expertise. Experiments on diverse multimodal QA benchmarks demonstrate that our cooperative, multi-agent framework consistently outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness.

  Research interest in end-to-end autonomous driving has surged owing to its fully differentiable design integrating modular tasks, i.e. perception, prediction and planing, which enables optimization in pursuit of the ultimate goal. Despite the great potential of the end-to-end paradigm, existing methods suffer from several aspects including expensive BEV (bird's eye view) computation, action diversity, and sub-optimal decision in complex real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid sparse-dense diffusion policy, empowered by a Vision-Language Model (VLM), called Diff-VLA. We explore the sparse diffusion representation for efficient multi-modal driving behavior. Moreover, we rethink the effectiveness of VLM driving decision and improve the trajectory generation guidance through deep interaction across agent, map instances and VLM output. Our method shows superior performance in Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025 which contains challenging real and reactive synthetic scenarios. Our methods achieves 45.0 PDMS.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Logical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence and an essential capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Despite the significant advancement in multimodal reasoning, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate their reasoning abilities due to the lack of explicit categorization for logical reasoning types and an unclear understanding of reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce MME-Reasoning, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of MLLMs, which covers all three types of reasoning (i.e., inductive, deductive, and abductive) in its questions. We carefully curate the data to ensure that each question effectively evaluates reasoning ability rather than perceptual skills or knowledge breadth, and extend the evaluation protocols to cover the evaluation of diverse questions. Our evaluation reveals substantial limitations of state-of-the-art MLLMs when subjected to holistic assessments of logical reasoning capabilities. Even the most advanced MLLMs show limited performance in comprehensive logical reasoning, with notable performance imbalances across reasoning types. In addition, we conducted an in-depth analysis of approaches such as ``thinking mode'' and Rule-based RL, which are commonly believed to enhance reasoning abilities. These findings highlight the critical limitations and performance imbalances of current MLLMs in diverse logical reasoning scenarios, providing comprehensive and systematic insights into the understanding and evaluation of reasoning capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Procedural mistake detection (PMD) is a challenging problem of classifying whether a human user (observed through egocentric video) has successfully executed a task (specified by a procedural text). Despite significant recent efforts, machine performance in the wild remains nonviable, and the reasoning processes underlying this performance are opaque. As such, we extend PMD to require generating visual self-dialog rationales to inform decisions. Given the impressive, mature image understanding capabilities observed in recent vision-and-language models (VLMs), we curate a suitable benchmark dataset for PMD based on individual frames. As our reformulation enables unprecedented transparency, we leverage a natural language inference (NLI) model to formulate two automated metrics for the coherence of generated rationales. We establish baselines for this reframed task, showing that while VLMs struggle off-the-shelf, their accuracy, coherence, and efficiency can be improved by incorporating these metrics into common inference and fine-tuning methods- though not without tradeoff. Lastly, our multi-faceted metrics visualize common outcomes, highlighting areas for further improvement.

  Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have spurred increased interest in Device-Control Agents (DC agents), such as utilizing in-the-wild device control to manage graphical user interfaces. Conventional methods for assessing the capabilities of DC agents, such as computing step-wise action accuracy and overall task success rates, provide a macroscopic view of DC agents' performance; however, they fail to offer microscopic insights into potential errors that may occur in real-world applications. Conducting a finer-grained performance evaluation of DC agents presents significant challenges. This study introduces a new perspective on evaluation methods for DC agents by proposing the XBOUND evaluation method, which employs the calculation of a novel Explore Metric to delineate the capability boundaries of DC agents. Compared to previous evaluation methods, XBOUND focuses on individual states to assess the proficiency of DC agents in mastering these states. Furthermore, we have developed a ``pseudo'' episode tree dataset derived from Android Control test data. Utilizing this dataset and XBOUND, we comprehensively evaluate the OS-Atlas and UI-TARS series, examining both the overall and specific performance across five common tasks. Additionally, we select representative cases to highlight the current deficiencies and limitations inherent in both series. Code is available atthis https URL.

  _Zhengyang Ji, Yifan Jia, Shang Gao, Yutao Yue_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, yet they also exhibit notable social biases. These biases often manifest as unintended associations between neutral concepts and sensitive human attributes, leading to disparate model behaviors across demographic groups. While existing studies primarily focus on detecting and quantifying such biases, they offer limited insight into the underlying mechanisms within the models. To address this gap, we propose an explanatory framework that combines information flow analysis with multi-round dialogue evaluation, aiming to understand the origin of social bias from the perspective of imbalanced internal information utilization. Specifically, we first identify high-contribution image tokens involved in the model's reasoning process for neutral questions via information flow analysis. Then, we design a multi-turn dialogue mechanism to evaluate the extent to which these key tokens encode sensitive information. Extensive experiments reveal that LVLMs exhibit systematic disparities in information usage when processing images of different demographic groups, suggesting that social bias is deeply rooted in the model's internal reasoning dynamics. Furthermore, we complement our findings from a textual modality perspective, showing that the model's semantic representations already display biased proximity patterns, thereby offering a cross-modal explanation of bias formation.

  The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has unlocked new opportunities to tackle complex scientific challenges. Despite this progress, their application in addressing earth science problems, especially at the graduate level, remains underexplored. A significant barrier is the absence of benchmarks that capture the depth and contextual complexity of geoscientific reasoning. Current benchmarks often rely on synthetic datasets or simplistic figure-caption pairs, which do not adequately reflect the intricate reasoning and domain-specific insights required for real-world scientific applications. To address these gaps, we introduce MSEarth, a multimodal scientific benchmark curated from high-quality, open-access scientific publications. MSEarth encompasses the five major spheres of Earth science: atmosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere, featuring over 7K figures with refined captions. These captions are crafted from the original figure captions and enriched with discussions and reasoning from the papers, ensuring the benchmark captures the nuanced reasoning and knowledge-intensive content essential for advanced scientific tasks. MSEarth supports a variety of tasks, including scientific figure captioning, multiple choice questions, and open-ended reasoning challenges. By bridging the gap in graduate-level benchmarks, MSEarth provides a scalable and high-fidelity resource to enhance the development and evaluation of MLLMs in scientific reasoning. The benchmark is publicly available to foster further research and innovation in this field. Resources related to this benchmark can be found atthis https URLandthis https URL.

  Spatial reasoning is a core component of human cognition, enabling individuals to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. It relies on a nuanced understanding of spatial structures and inter-object relationships, serving as the foundation for complex reasoning and decision-making. To investigate whether current vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit similar capability, we introduce Jigsaw-Puzzles, a novel benchmark consisting of 1,100 carefully curated real-world images with high spatial complexity. Based on this dataset, we design five tasks to rigorously evaluate VLMs' spatial perception, structural understanding, and reasoning capabilities, while deliberately minimizing reliance on domain-specific knowledge to better isolate and assess the general spatial reasoning capability. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 24 state-of-the-art VLMs. The results show that even the strongest model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves only 77.14% overall accuracy and performs particularly poorly on the Order Generation task, with only 30.00% accuracy, far below the performance exceeding 90% achieved by human participants. This persistent gap underscores the need for continued progress, positioning Jigsaw-Puzzles as a challenging and diagnostic benchmark for advancing spatial reasoning research in VLMs.

  The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) poses a stringent test of general AI capabilities, requiring solvers to infer abstract patterns from only a handful of examples. Despite substantial progress in deep learning, state-of-the-art models still achieve accuracy rates of merely 40-55% on 2024 ARC Competition, indicative of a significant gap between their performance and human-level reasoning. In this work, we seek to bridge that gap by introducing an analogy-inspired ARC dataset, GIFARC. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), we synthesize new ARC-style tasks from a variety of GIF images that include analogies. Each new task is paired with ground-truth analogy, providing an explicit mapping between visual transformations and everyday concepts. By embedding robust human-intuitive analogies into ARC-style tasks, GIFARC guides AI agents to evaluate the task analogically before engaging in brute-force pattern search, thus efficiently reducing problem complexity and build a more concise and human-understandable solution. We empirically validate that guiding LLM with analogic approach with GIFARC affects task-solving approaches of LLMs to align with analogic approach of human.

  Spatial Planning is a crucial part in the field of spatial intelligence, which requires the understanding and planning about object arrangements in space perspective. AI agents with the spatial planning ability can better adapt to various real-world applications, including robotic manipulation, automatic assembly, urban planning etc. Recent works have attempted to construct benchmarks for evaluating the spatial intelligence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial reasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers from the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task execution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive benchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability of open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild requires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on the given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial planning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data collection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates spatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial understanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on MineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based agents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their spatial planning abilities. We believe our MineAnyBuild will open new avenues for the evaluation of spatial intelligence and help promote further development for open-world AI agents capable of spatial planning.

  Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled unified processing of language, vision, and structured inputs, opening the door to complex tasks such as logical deduction, spatial reasoning, and scientific analysis. Despite their promise, the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, particularly those augmented with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T), remain poorly understood and lack standardized evaluation benchmarks. Existing work focuses primarily on perception or final answer correctness, offering limited insight into how models reason or fail across modalities. To address this gap, we introduce the MMMR, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking. The MMMR comprises 1) a high-difficulty dataset of 1,083 questions spanning six diverse reasoning types with symbolic depth and multi-hop demands and 2) a modular Reasoning Trace Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP) for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy through metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotations. Empirical results show that MLLMs-T overall outperform non-thinking counterparts, but even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5 Pro suffer from reasoning pathologies such as inconsistency and overthinking. This benchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and provides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development. Overall, the MMMR offers a scalable foundation for evaluating, comparing, and improving the next generation of multi-modal reasoning systems.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chart understanding tasks. However, interpreting charts with textual descriptions often leads to information loss, as it fails to fully capture the dense information embedded in charts. In contrast, parsing charts into code provides lossless representations that can effectively contain all critical details. Although existing open-source MLLMs have achieved success in chart understanding tasks, they still face two major challenges when applied to chart-to-code tasks: (1) Low executability and poor restoration of chart details in the generated code and (2) Lack of large-scale and diverse training data. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ChartCoder}, the first dedicated chart-to-code MLLM, which leverages Code LLMs as the language backbone to enhance the executability of the generated code. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Chart2Code-160k}, the first large-scale and diverse dataset for chart-to-code generation, and propose the \textbf{Snippet-of-Thought (SoT)} method, which transforms direct chart-to-code generation data into step-by-step generation. Experiments demonstrate that ChartCoder, with only 7B parameters, surpasses existing open-source MLLMs on chart-to-code benchmarks, achieving superior chart restoration and code excitability. Our code is available atthis https URL.
