- **[GRAPPA: Generalizing and Adapting Robot Policies via Online Agentic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06473)**  `arXiv:2410.06473`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robot learning approaches such as behavior cloning and reinforcement learning have shown great promise in synthesizing robot skills from human demonstrations in specific environments. However, these approaches often require task-specific demonstrations or designing complex simulation environments, which limits the development of generalizable and robust policies for unseen real-world settings. Recent advances in the use of foundation models for robotics (e.g., LLMs, VLMs) have shown great potential in enabling systems to understand the semantics in the world from large-scale internet data. However, it remains an open challenge to use this knowledge to enable robotic systems to understand the underlying dynamics of the world, to generalize policies across different tasks, and to adapt policies to new environments. To alleviate these limitations, we propose an agentic framework for robot self-guidance and self-improvement, which consists of a set of role-specialized conversational agents, such as a high-level advisor, a grounding agent, a monitoring agent, and a robotic agent. Our framework iteratively grounds a base robot policy to relevant objects in the environment and uses visuomotor cues to shift the action distribution of the policy to more desirable states, online, while remaining agnostic to the subjective configuration of a given robot hardware platform. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively guide manipulation policies to achieve significantly higher success rates, both in simulation and in real-world experiments, without the need for additional human demonstrations or extensive exploration.

  In Visual Document Understanding (VDU) tasks, fine-tuning a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) with new datasets often falls short in optimizing the vision encoder to identify query-specific regions in text-rich document images. Existing methods that directly inject queries into model layers by modifying the network architecture often struggle to adapt to new datasets with limited annotations. To address this, we introduce QID, a novel, streamlined, architecture-preserving approach that integrates query embeddings into the vision encoder, leading to notable performance gains, particularly in data-scarce fine-tuning scenarios. Specifically, our approach introduces a dual-module framework: a query-aware module that generates a unique query vector to precisely guide the model's focus, as well as a query-agnostic module that captures the positional relationships among tokens, ensuring robust spatial understanding. Notably, both modules operate independently of the vision attention blocks, facilitating targeted learning of query embeddings and enhancing visual semantic identification. Experiments with OCR-free VLMs across multiple datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements using our method, especially in handling text-rich documents in data-scarce environments.

  Multimodal reasoning, which integrates language and visual cues into problem solving and decision making, is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence and a crucial step toward artificial general intelligence. However, the evaluation of multimodal reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains inadequate. Most existing reasoning benchmarks are constrained by limited data size, narrow domain coverage, and unstructured knowledge distribution. To close these gaps, we introduce MDK12-Bench, a multi-disciplinary benchmark assessing the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs via real-world K-12 examinations. Spanning six disciplines (math, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and information science), our benchmark comprises 140K reasoning instances across diverse difficulty levels from primary school to 12th grade. It features 6,827 instance-level knowledge point annotations based on a well-organized knowledge structure, detailed answer explanations, difficulty labels and cross-year partitions, providing a robust platform for comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, we present a novel dynamic evaluation framework to mitigate data contamination issues by bootstrapping question forms, question types, and image styles during evaluation. Extensive experiment on MDK12-Bench reveals the significant limitation of current MLLMs in multimodal reasoning. The findings on our benchmark provide insights into the development of the next-generation models. Our data and codes are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly in processing multimodal information, but their ability to reconcile conflicting signals across modalities remains underexplored. This work investigates how VLMs process ASCII art, a unique medium where textual elements collectively form visual patterns, potentially creating semantic-visual conflicts. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that systematically challenges five state-of-the-art models (including GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini) using adversarial ASCII art, where character-level semantics deliberately contradict global visual patterns. Our experiments reveal a strong text-priority bias: VLMs consistently prioritize textual information over visual patterns, with visual recognition ability declining dramatically as semantic complexity increases. Various mitigation attempts through visual parameter tuning and prompt engineering yielded only modest improvements, suggesting that this limitation requires architectural-level solutions. These findings uncover fundamental flaws in how current VLMs integrate multimodal information, providing important guidance for future model development while highlighting significant implications for content moderation systems vulnerable to adversarial examples.

- **[Retrieval-Based Interleaved Visual Chain-of-Thought in Real-World Driving Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04671)**  `arXiv:2501.04671`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models, its effectiveness in vision-language models (VLMs) remains limited due to over-reliance on textual cues and memorized knowledge. To investigate the visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs in complex real-world scenarios, we introduce DrivingVQA, a visual question answering dataset derived from driving theory exams, which contains 3,931 multiple-choice problems with expert-written explanations and grounded entities relevant to the reasoning process. Leveraging this dataset, we propose RIV-CoT, a Retrieval-Based Interleaved Visual Chain-of-Thought method that enables VLMs to reason using visual crops corresponding to these relevant entities. Our experiments demonstrate that RIV-CoT improves answer accuracy by 3.1% and reasoning accuracy by 4.6% over vanilla CoT prompting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method effectively scales to the larger A-OKVQA reasoning dataset by leveraging automatically generated pseudo-labels, outperforming CoT prompting.

- **[Black Swan: Abductive and Defeasible Video Reasoning in Unpredictable Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05725)**  `arXiv:2412.05725`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Aditya Chinchure, Sahithya Ravi, Raymond Ng, Vered Shwartz, Boyang Li, Leonid Sigal_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The commonsense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), especially in abductive reasoning and defeasible reasoning, remain poorly understood. Most benchmarks focus on typical visual scenarios, making it difficult to discern whether model performance stems from keen perception and reasoning skills, or reliance on pure statistical recall. We argue that by focusing on atypical events in videos, clearer insights can be gained on the core capabilities of VLMs. Explaining and understanding such out-of-distribution events requires models to extend beyond basic pattern recognition and regurgitation of their prior knowledge. To this end, we introduce BlackSwanSuite, a benchmark for evaluating VLMs' ability to reason about unexpected events through abductive and defeasible tasks. Our tasks artificially limit the amount of visual information provided to models while questioning them about hidden unexpected events, or provide new visual information that could change an existing hypothesis about the event. We curate a comprehensive benchmark suite comprising over 3,800 MCQ, 4,900 generative and 6,700 yes/no questions, spanning 1,655 videos. After extensively evaluating various state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, as well as open-source VLMs such as LLaVA-Video, we find significant performance gaps of up to 32% from humans on these tasks. Our findings reveal key limitations in current VLMs, emphasizing the need for enhanced model architectures and training strategies. Our data and leaderboard is available atthis http URL.

- **[SceneTAP: Scene-Coherent Typographic Adversarial Planner against Vision-Language Models in Real-World Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00114)**  `arXiv:2412.00114`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yue Cao, Yun Xing, Jie Zhang, Di Lin, Tianwei Zhang, Ivor Tsang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in interpreting visual content. While existing works demonstrate these models' vulnerability to deliberately placed adversarial texts, such texts are often easily identifiable as anomalous. In this paper, we present the first approach to generate scene-coherent typographic adversarial attacks that mislead advanced LVLMs while maintaining visual naturalness through the capability of the LLM-based agent. Our approach addresses three critical questions: what adversarial text to generate, where to place it within the scene, and how to integrate it seamlessly. We propose a training-free, multi-modal LLM-driven scene-coherent typographic adversarial planning (SceneTAP) that employs a three-stage process: scene understanding, adversarial planning, and seamless integration. The SceneTAP utilizes chain-of-thought reasoning to comprehend the scene, formulate effective adversarial text, strategically plan its placement, and provide detailed instructions for natural integration within the image. This is followed by a scene-coherent TextDiffuser that executes the attack using a local diffusion mechanism. We extend our method to real-world scenarios by printing and placing generated patches in physical environments, demonstrating its practical implications. Extensive experiments show that our scene-coherent adversarial text successfully misleads state-of-the-art LVLMs, including ChatGPT-4o, even after capturing new images of physical setups. Our evaluations demonstrate a significant increase in attack success rates while maintaining visual naturalness and contextual appropriateness. This work highlights vulnerabilities in current vision-language models to sophisticated, scene-coherent adversarial attacks and provides insights into potential defense mechanisms.

- **[OmniSVG: A Unified Scalable Vector Graphics Generation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06263)**  `arXiv:2504.06263`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yiying Yang, Wei Cheng, Sijin Chen, Xianfang Zeng, Jiaxu Zhang, Liao Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an important image format widely adopted in graphic design because of their resolution independence and editability. The study of generating high-quality SVG has continuously drawn attention from both designers and researchers in the AIGC community. However, existing methods either produces unstructured outputs with huge computational cost or is limited to generating monochrome icons of over-simplified structures. To produce high-quality and complex SVG, we propose OmniSVG, a unified framework that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for end-to-end multimodal SVG generation. By parameterizing SVG commands and coordinates into discrete tokens, OmniSVG decouples structural logic from low-level geometry for efficient training while maintaining the expressiveness of complex SVG structure. To further advance the development of SVG synthesis, we introduce MMSVG-2M, a multimodal dataset with two million richly annotated SVG assets, along with a standardized evaluation protocol for conditional SVG generation tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniSVG outperforms existing methods and demonstrates its potential for integration into professional SVG design workflows.

- **[Transfer between Modalities with MetaQueries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06256)**  `arXiv:2504.06256`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xichen Pan, Satya Narayan Shukla, Aashu Singh, Zhuokai Zhao, Shlok Kumar Mishra, Jialiang Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unified multimodal models aim to integrate understanding (text output) and generation (pixel output), but aligning these different modalities within a single architecture often demands complex training recipes and careful data balancing. We introduce MetaQueries, a set of learnable queries that act as an efficient interface between autoregressive multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and diffusion models. MetaQueries connects the MLLM's latents to the diffusion decoder, enabling knowledge-augmented image generation by leveraging the MLLM's deep understanding and reasoning capabilities. Our method simplifies training, requiring only paired image-caption data and standard diffusion objectives. Notably, this transfer is effective even when the MLLM backbone remains frozen, thereby preserving its state-of-the-art multimodal understanding capabilities while achieving strong generative performance. Additionally, our method is flexible and can be easily instruction-tuned for advanced applications such as image editing and subject-driven generation.

- **[V-MAGE: A Game Evaluation Framework for Assessing Visual-Centric Capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06148)**  `arXiv:2504.06148`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xiangxi Zheng, Linjie Li, Zhengyuan Yang, Ping Yu, Alex Jinpeng Wang, Rui Yan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have led to significant improvements across various multimodal benchmarks. However, as evaluations shift from static datasets to open-world, dynamic environments, current game-based benchmarks remain inadequate because they lack visual-centric tasks and fail to assess the diverse reasoning skills required for real-world decision-making. To address this, we introduce Visual-centric Multiple Abilities Game Evaluation (V-MAGE), a game-based evaluation framework designed to assess visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. V-MAGE features five diverse games with 30+ handcrafted levels, testing models on core visual skills such as positioning, trajectory tracking, timing, and visual memory, alongside higher-level reasoning like long-term planning and deliberation. We use V-MAGE to evaluate leading MLLMs, revealing significant challenges in their visual perception and reasoning. In all game environments, the top-performing MLLMs, as determined by Elo rating comparisons, exhibit a substantial performance gap compared to humans. Our findings highlight critical limitations, including various types of perceptual errors made by the models, and suggest potential avenues for improvement from an agent-centric perspective, such as refining agent strategies and addressing perceptual inaccuracies.

- **[econSG: Efficient and Multi-view Consistent Open-Vocabulary 3D Semantic Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06003)**  `arXiv:2504.06003`  `cs.CV`  
  _Can Zhang, Gim Hee Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The primary focus of most recent works on open-vocabulary neural fields is extracting precise semantic features from the VLMs and then consolidating them efficiently into a multi-view consistent 3D neural fields representation. However, most existing works over-trusted SAM to regularize image-level CLIP without any further refinement. Moreover, several existing works improved efficiency by dimensionality reduction of semantic features from 2D VLMs before fusing with 3DGS semantic fields, which inevitably leads to multi-view inconsistency. In this work, we propose econSG for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with 3DGS. Our econSG consists of: 1) A Confidence-region Guided Regularization (CRR) that mutually refines SAM and CLIP to get the best of both worlds for precise semantic features with complete and precise boundaries. 2) A low dimensional contextual space to enforce 3D multi-view consistency while improving computational efficiency by fusing backprojected multi-view 2D features and follow by dimensional reduction directly on the fused 3D features instead of operating on each 2D view separately. Our econSG shows state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets compared to the existing methods. Furthermore, we are also the most efficient training among all the methods.

- **[On the Suitability of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to Visual Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05682)**  `arXiv:2504.05682`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xiaxu Chen, Wei Li, Chunxu Liu, Chi Xie, Xiaoyan Hu, Chengqian Ma, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) is proved to be greatly valuable for enhancing the reasoning ability of LLMs. Researchers have been starting to apply RFT to MLLMs, hoping it will also enhance the capabilities of visual understanding. However, these works are at a very early stage and have not examined how suitable RFT actually is for visual tasks. In this work, we endeavor to understand the suitabilities and limitations of RFT for visual tasks, through experimental analysis and observations. We start by quantitative comparisons on various tasks, which shows RFT is generally better than SFT on visual tasks. %especially when the number of training samples are limited. To check whether such advantages are brought up by the reasoning process, we design a new reward that encourages the model to ``think'' more, whose results show more thinking can be beneficial for complicated tasks but harmful for simple tasks. We hope this study can provide more insight for the rapid advancements on this topic.

- **[REVEAL: Relation-based Video Representation Learning for Video-Question-Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05463)**  `arXiv:2504.05463`  `cs.CV`  
  _Sofian Chaybouti, Walid Bousselham, Moritz Wolter, Hilde Kuehne_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video-Question-Answering (VideoQA) comprises the capturing of complex visual relation changes over time, remaining a challenge even for advanced Video Language Models (VLM), i.a., because of the need to represent the visual content to a reasonably sized input for those models. To address this problem, we proposeRElation-based Video rEpresentAtion Learning (REVEAL), a framework designed to capture visual relation information by encoding them into structured, decomposed representations. Specifically, inspired by spatiotemporal scene graphs, we propose to encode video sequences as sets of relation triplets in the form of (\textit{subject-predicate-object}) over time via their language embeddings. To this end, we extract explicit relations from video captions and introduce a Many-to-Many Noise Contrastive Estimation (MM-NCE) together with a Q-Former architecture to align an unordered set of video-derived queries with corresponding text-based relation descriptions. At inference, the resulting Q-former produces an efficient token representation that can serve as input to a VLM for VideoQA.We evaluate the proposed framework on five challenging benchmarks: NeXT-QA, Intent-QA, STAR, VLEP, and TVQA. It shows that the resulting query-based video representation is able to outperform global alignment-based CLS or patch token representations and achieves competitive results against state-of-the-art models, particularly on tasks requiring temporal reasoning and relation comprehension. The code and models will be publicly released.

- **[Taxonomy-Aware Evaluation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05457)**  `arXiv:2504.05457`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When a vision-language model (VLM) is prompted to identify an entity depicted in an image, it may answer 'I see a conifer,' rather than the specific label 'norway spruce'. This raises two issues for evaluation: First, the unconstrained generated text needs to be mapped to the evaluation label space (i.e., 'conifer'). Second, a useful classification measure should give partial credit to less-specific, but not incorrect, answers ('norway spruce' being a type of 'conifer'). To meet these requirements, we propose a framework for evaluating unconstrained text predictions, such as those generated from a vision-language model, against a taxonomy. Specifically, we propose the use of hierarchical precision and recall measures to assess the level of correctness and specificity of predictions with regard to a taxonomy. Experimentally, we first show that existing text similarity measures do not capture taxonomic similarity well. We then develop and compare different methods to map textual VLM predictions onto a taxonomy. This allows us to compute hierarchical similarity measures between the generated text and the ground truth labels. Finally, we analyze modern VLMs on fine-grained visual classification tasks based on our proposed taxonomic evaluation scheme.

- **[Investigating the Scaling Effect of Instruction Templates for Training Multimodal Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08307)**  `arXiv:2412.08307`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current multimodal language model (MLM) training approaches overlook the influence of instruction templates. Previous research deals with this problem by leveraging hand-crafted or model-generated templates, failing to investigate the scaling effect of instruction templates on MLM training. In this work, we propose a programmatic instruction template generator capable of producing over 15K unique instruction templates by filling randomly sampled positional synonyms into weighted sampled meta templates, enabling us to comprehensively explore MLM's performance across various template scales in the training process. Our investigation into scaling instruction templates for MLM training demonstrates that MLM capabilities do not consistently improve with increasing template scale. Instead, optimal performance is achieved at a medium template scale. Models trained with data augmented at the optimal template scale achieve performance gains of up to 10% over those trained on the original data and achieve the best overall performance compared with the similar-scale MLMs tuned on at most 75 times the scale of our augmented dataset. The code will be publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[Scaling Video-Language Models to 10K Frames via Hierarchical Differential Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02438)**  `arXiv:2504.02438`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Chuanqi Cheng, Jian Guan, Wei Wu, Rui Yan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-form video processing fundamentally challenges vision-language models (VLMs) due to the high computational costs of handling extended temporal sequences. Existing token pruning and feature merging methods often sacrifice critical temporal dependencies or dilute semantic information. We introduce differential distillation, a principled approach that systematically preserves task-relevant information while suppressing redundancy. Based on this principle, we develop ViLaMP, a hierarchical video-language model that processes hour-long videos at ``mixed precision'' through two key mechanisms: (1) differential keyframe selection that maximizes query relevance while maintaining temporal distinctiveness at the frame level and (2) differential feature merging that preserves query-salient features in non-keyframes at the patch level. Hence, ViLaMP retains full information in keyframes while reducing non-keyframes to their most salient features, resembling mixed-precision training. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViLaMP's superior performance across four video understanding benchmarks, particularly on long-form content. Notably, ViLaMP can process ultra-long videos (up to 10K frames) on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, achieving substantial computational efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Charts are ubiquitous, as people often use them to analyze data, answer questions, and discover critical insights. However, performing complex analytical tasks with charts requires significant perceptual and cognitive effort. Chart Question Answering (CQA) systems automate this process by enabling models to interpret and reason with visual representations of data. However, existing benchmarks like ChartQA lack real-world diversity and have recently shown performance saturation with modern large vision-language models (LVLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce ChartQAPro, a new benchmark that includes 1,341 charts from 157 diverse sources, spanning various chart types, including infographics and dashboards, and featuring 1,948 questions in various types, such as multiple-choice, conversational, hypothetical, and unanswerable questions, to better reflect real-world challenges. Our evaluations with 21 models show a substantial performance drop for LVLMs on ChartQAPro; e.g., Claude Sonnet 3.5 scores 90.5% on ChartQA but only 55.81% on ChartQAPro, underscoring the complexity of chart reasoning. We complement our findings with detailed error analyses and ablation studies, identifying key challenges and opportunities for advancing LVLMs in chart understanding and reasoning. We release ChartQAPro atthis https URL.
