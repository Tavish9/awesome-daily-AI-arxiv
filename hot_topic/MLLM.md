- **[From Foresight to Forethought: VLM-In-the-Loop Policy Steering via Latent Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01828)**  `arXiv:2502.01828`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While generative robot policies have demonstrated significant potential in learning complex, multimodal behaviors from demonstrations, they still exhibit diverse failures at deployment-time. Policy steering offers an elegant solution to reducing the chance of failure by using an external verifier to select from low-level actions proposed by an imperfect generative policy. Here, one might hope to use a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a verifier, leveraging its open-world reasoning capabilities. However, off-the-shelf VLMs struggle to understand the consequences of low-level robot actions as they are represented fundamentally differently than the text and images the VLM was trained on. In response, we propose FOREWARN, a novel framework to unlock the potential of VLMs as open-vocabulary verifiers for runtime policy steering. Our key idea is to decouple the VLM's burden of predicting action outcomes (foresight) from evaluation (forethought). For foresight, we leverage a latent world model to imagine future latent states given diverse low-level action plans. For forethought, we align the VLM with these predicted latent states to reason about the consequences of actions in its native representation--natural language--and effectively filter proposed plans. We validate our framework across diverse robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating its ability to bridge representational gaps and provide robust, generalizable policy steering.

  Tool use enhances a robot's task capabilities. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have equipped robots with sophisticated cognitive capabilities for tool-use applications. However, existing methodologies focus on elementary quasi-static tool manipulations or high-level tool selection while neglecting the critical aspect of task-appropriate tool grasping. To address this limitation, we introduce inverse Tool-Use Planning (iTUP), a novel VLM-driven framework that enables grounded fine-grained planning for versatile robotic tool use. Through an integrated pipeline of VLM-based tool and contact point grounding, position-velocity trajectory planning, and physics-informed grasp generation and selection, iTUP demonstrates versatility across (1) quasi-static and more challenging (2) dynamic and (3) cluster tool-use tasks. To ensure robust planning, our framework integrates stable and safe task-aware grasping by reasoning over semantic affordances and physical constraints. We evaluate iTUP and baselines on a comprehensive range of realistic tool use tasks including precision hammering, object scooping, and cluster sweeping. Experimental results demonstrate that iTUP ensures a thorough grounding of cognition and planning for challenging robot tool use across diverse environments.

- **[Efficient Vocabulary-Free Fine-Grained Visual Recognition in the Age of Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01064)**  `arXiv:2505.01064`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  Fine-grained Visual Recognition (FGVR) involves distinguishing between visually similar categories, which is inherently challenging due to subtle inter-class differences and the need for large, expert-annotated datasets. In domains like medical imaging, such curated datasets are unavailable due to issues like privacy concerns and high annotation costs. In such scenarios lacking labeled data, an FGVR model cannot rely on a predefined set of training labels, and hence has an unconstrained output space for predictions. We refer to this task as Vocabulary-Free FGVR (VF-FGVR), where a model must predict labels from an unconstrained output space without prior label information. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show potential for VF-FGVR, querying these models for each test input is impractical because of high costs and prohibitive inference times. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{Nea}rest-Neighbor Label \textbf{R}efinement (NeaR), a novel approach that fine-tunes a downstream CLIP model using labels generated by an MLLM. Our approach constructs a weakly supervised dataset from a small, unlabeled training set, leveraging MLLMs for label generation. NeaR is designed to handle the noise, stochasticity, and open-endedness inherent in labels generated by MLLMs, and establishes a new benchmark for efficient VF-FGVR.

- **[Evaluating Vision Language Model Adaptations for Radiology Report Generation in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01096)**  `arXiv:2505.01096`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`

  The integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare has opened new horizons for improving medical diagnostics and patient care. However, challenges persist in developing systems capable of generating accurate and contextually relevant radiology reports, particularly in low-resource languages. In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of instruction-tuned Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the specialized task of radiology report generation across three low-resource languages: Italian, German, and Spanish. Employing the LLaVA architectural framework, we conducted a systematic evaluation of pre-trained models utilizing general datasets, domain-specific datasets, and low-resource language-specific datasets. In light of the unavailability of models that possess prior knowledge of both the medical domain and low-resource languages, we analyzed various adaptations to determine the most effective approach for these contexts. The results revealed that language-specific models substantially outperformed both general and domain-specific models in generating radiology reports, emphasizing the critical role of linguistic adaptation. Additionally, models fine-tuned with medical terminology exhibited enhanced performance across all languages compared to models with generic knowledge, highlighting the importance of domain-specific training. We also explored the influence of the temperature parameter on the coherence of report generation, providing insights for optimal model settings. Our findings highlight the importance of tailored language and domain-specific training for improving the quality and accuracy of radiological reports in multilingual settings. This research not only advances our understanding of VLMs adaptability in healthcare but also points to significant avenues for future investigations into model tuning and language-specific adaptations.

  The steady improvements of text-to-image (T2I) generative models lead to slow deprecation of automatic evaluation benchmarks that rely on static datasets, motivating researchers to seek alternative ways to evaluate the T2I progress. In this paper, we explore the potential of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as evaluator agents that interact with a T2I model, with the objective of assessing prompt-generation consistency and image aesthetics. We present Multimodal Text-to-Image Eval (MT2IE), an evaluation framework that iteratively generates prompts for evaluation, scores generated images and matches T2I evaluation of existing benchmarks with a fraction of the prompts used in existing static benchmarks. Moreover, we show that MT2IE's prompt-generation consistency scores have higher correlation with human judgment than scores previously introduced in the literature. MT2IE generates prompts that are efficient at probing T2I model performance, producing the same relative T2I model rankings as existing benchmarks while using only 1/80th the number of prompts for evaluation.

- **[Empowering Agentic Video Analytics Systems with Video Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00254)**  `arXiv:2505.00254`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly pivotal across diverse domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific, predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical scenarios. The recent emergence of Video-Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVAS, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVAS incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVAS achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively, significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVAS-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex question-answer pairs. On AVAS-100, AVAS achieves top-tier performance with an accuracy of 75.8%.

- **[Steering Away from Harm: An Adaptive Approach to Defending Vision Language Model Against Jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16721)**  `arXiv:2411.16721`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Han Wang, Gang Wang, Huan Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Language Models (VLMs) can produce unintended and harmful content when exposed to adversarial attacks, particularly because their vision capabilities create new vulnerabilities. Existing defenses, such as input preprocessing, adversarial training, and response evaluation-based methods, are often impractical for real-world deployment due to their high costs. To address this challenge, we propose ASTRA, an efficient and effective defense by adaptively steering models away from adversarial feature directions to resist VLM attacks. Our key procedures involve finding transferable steering vectors representing the direction of harmful response and applying adaptive activation steering to remove these directions at inference time. To create effective steering vectors, we randomly ablate the visual tokens from the adversarial images and identify those most strongly associated with jailbreaks. These tokens are then used to construct steering vectors. During inference, we perform the adaptive steering method that involves the projection between the steering vectors and calibrated activation, resulting in little performance drops on benign inputs while strongly avoiding harmful outputs under adversarial inputs. Extensive experiments across multiple models and baselines demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance and high efficiency in mitigating jailbreak risks. Additionally, ASTRA exhibits good transferability, defending against unseen attacks (i.e., structured-based attack, perturbation-based attack with project gradient descent variants, and text-only attack).

- **[FreeInsert: Disentangled Text-Guided Object Insertion in 3D Gaussian Scene without Spatial Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01322)**  `arXiv:2505.01322`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chenxi Li, Weijie Wang, Qiang Li, Bruno Lepri, Nicu Sebe, Weizhi Nie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-driven object insertion in 3D scenes is an emerging task that enables intuitive scene editing through natural language. However, existing 2D editing-based methods often rely on spatial priors such as 2D masks or 3D bounding boxes, and they struggle to ensure consistency of the inserted object. These limitations hinder flexibility and scalability in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose FreeInsert, a novel framework that leverages foundation models including MLLMs, LGMs, and diffusion models to disentangle object generation from spatial placement. This enables unsupervised and flexible object insertion in 3D scenes without spatial priors. FreeInsert starts with an MLLM-based parser that extracts structured semantics, including object types, spatial relationships, and attachment regions, from user instructions. These semantics guide both the reconstruction of the inserted object for 3D consistency and the learning of its degrees of freedom. We leverage the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to initialize object pose and scale. A hierarchical, spatially aware refinement stage further integrates spatial semantics and MLLM-inferred priors to enhance placement. Finally, the appearance of the object is improved using the inserted-object image to enhance visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FreeInsert achieves semantically coherent, spatially precise, and visually realistic 3D insertions without relying on spatial priors, offering a user-friendly and flexible editing experience.

- **[InstructAttribute: Fine-grained Object Attributes editing with Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00751)**  `arXiv:2505.00751`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xingxi Yin, Jingfeng Zhang, Zhi Li, Yicheng Li, Yin Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, renowned for their advanced generative abilities, are extensively utilized in image editing applications, demonstrating remarkable effectiveness. However, achieving precise control over fine-grained attributes still presents considerable challenges. Existing image editing techniques either fail to modify the attributes of an object or struggle to preserve its structure and maintain consistency in other areas of the image. To address these challenges, we propose the Structure-Preserving and Attribute Amplification (SPAA), a training-free method which enables precise control over the color and material transformations of objects by editing the self-attention maps and cross-attention values. Furthermore, we constructed the Attribute Dataset, which encompasses nearly all colors and materials associated with various objects, by integrating multimodal large language models (MLLM) to develop an automated pipeline for data filtering and instruction labeling. Training on this dataset, we present our InstructAttribute, an instruction-based model designed to facilitate fine-grained editing of color and material attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in object-level color and material editing, outperforming existing instruction-based image editing approaches.

- **[Insight-V: Exploring Long-Chain Visual Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14432)**  `arXiv:2411.14432`  `cs.CV`

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate enhanced capabilities and reliability by reasoning more, evolving from Chain-of-Thought prompting to product-level solutions like OpenAI o1. Despite various efforts to improve LLM reasoning, high-quality long-chain reasoning data and optimized training pipelines still remain inadequately explored in vision-language tasks. In this paper, we present Insight-V, an early effort to 1) scalably produce long and robust reasoning data for complex multi-modal tasks, and 2) an effective training pipeline to enhance the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, to create long and structured reasoning data without human labor, we design a two-step pipeline with a progressive strategy to generate sufficiently long and diverse reasoning paths and a multi-granularity assessment method to ensure data quality. We observe that directly supervising MLLMs with such long and complex reasoning data will not yield ideal reasoning ability. To tackle this problem, we design a multi-agent system consisting of a reasoning agent dedicated to performing long-chain reasoning and a summary agent trained to judge and summarize reasoning results. We further incorporate an iterative DPO algorithm to enhance the reasoning agent's generation stability and quality. Based on the popular LLaVA-NeXT model and our stronger base MLLM, we demonstrate significant performance gains across challenging multi-modal benchmarks requiring visual reasoning. Benefiting from our multi-agent system, Insight-V can also easily maintain or improve performance on perception-focused multi-modal tasks.

- **[$X^2$-DFD: A framework for eXplainable and eXtendable Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06126)**  `arXiv:2410.06126`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting deepfakes has become an important task. Most existing detection methods provide only real/fake predictions without offering human-comprehensible explanations. Recent studies leveraging MLLMs for deepfake detection have shown improvements in explainability. However, the performance of pre-trained MLLMs (e.g., LLaVA) remains limited due to a lack of understanding of their capabilities for this task and strategies to enhance them. In this work, we empirically assess the strengths and weaknesses of MLLMs specifically in deepfake detection via forgery features analysis. Building on these assessments, we propose a novel framework called ${X}^2$-DFD, consisting of three core modules. The first module, Model Feature Assessment (MFA), measures the detection capabilities of forgery features intrinsic to MLLMs, and gives a descending ranking of these features. The second module, Strong Feature Strengthening (SFS), enhances the detection and explanation capabilities by fine-tuning the MLLM on a dataset constructed based on the top-ranked features. The third module, Weak Feature Supplementing (WFS), improves the fine-tuned MLLM's capabilities on lower-ranked features by integrating external dedicated deepfake detectors. To verify the effectiveness of this framework, we further present a practical implementation, where an automated forgery features generation, evaluation, and ranking procedure is designed for MFA module; an automated generation procedure of the fine-tuning dataset containing real and fake images with explanations based on top-ranked features is developed for SFS model; an external conventional deepfake detector focusing on blending artifact, which corresponds to a low detection capability in the pre-trained MLLM, is integrated for WFS module. Experiments show that our approach enhances both detection and explanation performance.

  Vision and language model (VLM) decoders are currently the best-performing architectures on multimodal tasks. Next to answers, they are able to produce natural language explanations, either in post-hoc or CoT settings. However, it is not clear to what extent they are using the input vision and text modalities when generating answers or explanations. In this work, we investigate if VLMs rely on their input modalities differently when they produce explanations as opposed to answers. We also evaluate the self-consistency of VLM decoders in both post-hoc and CoT explanation settings, by extending existing unimodal tests and measures to VLM decoders. We find that most tested VLMs are less self-consistent than LLMs. Text contributions in all tested VL decoders are more important than image contributions in all examined tasks. However, when comparing explanation generation to answer generation, the contributions of images are significantly stronger for generating explanations compared to answers. This difference is even larger in CoT compared to post-hoc explanations. Lastly, we provide an up-to-date benchmarking of state-of-the-art VL decoders on the VALSE benchmark, which before was restricted to VL encoders. We find that the tested VL decoders still struggle with most phenomena tested by VALSE.
