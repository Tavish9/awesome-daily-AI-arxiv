- **[Efficient Active Training for Deep LiDAR Odometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03211)**  `arXiv:2509.03211`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  Robust and efficient deep LiDAR odometry models are crucial for accurate localization and 3D reconstruction, but typically require extensive and diverse training data to adapt to diverse environments, leading to inefficiencies. To tackle this, we introduce an active training framework designed to selectively extract training data from diverse environments, thereby reducing the training load and enhancing model generalization. Our framework is based on two key strategies: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental Selection (AIS). ITSS begins by breaking down motion sequences from general weather into nodes and edges for detailed trajectory analysis, prioritizing diverse sequences to form a rich initial training dataset for training the base model. For complex sequences that are difficult to analyze, especially under challenging snowy weather conditions, AIS uses scene reconstruction and prediction inconsistency to iteratively select training samples, refining the model to handle a wide range of real-world scenarios. Experiments across datasets and weather conditions validate our approach's effectiveness. Notably, our method matches the performance of full-dataset training with just 52\% of the sequence volume, demonstrating the training efficiency and robustness of our active training paradigm. By optimizing the training process, our approach sets the stage for more agile and reliable LiDAR odometry systems, capable of navigating diverse environmental conditions with greater precision.

- **[Sem-RaDiff: Diffusion-Based 3D Radar Semantic Perception in Cluttered Agricultural Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02283)**  `arXiv:2509.02283`  `cs.RO`

  Accurate and robust environmental perception is crucial for robot autonomous navigation. While current methods typically adopt optical sensors (e.g., camera, LiDAR) as primary sensing modalities, their susceptibility to visual occlusion often leads to degraded performance or complete system failure. In this paper, we focus on agricultural scenarios where robots are exposed to the risk of onboard sensor contamination. Leveraging radar's strong penetration capability, we introduce a radar-based 3D environmental perception framework as a viable alternative. It comprises three core modules designed for dense and accurate semantic perception: 1) Parallel frame accumulation to enhance signal-to-noise ratio of radar raw data. 2) A diffusion model-based hierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts then generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds. 3) A specifically designed sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data. We conducted extensive benchmark comparisons and experimental evaluations on a self-built dataset collected in real-world agricultural field scenes. Results demonstrate that our method achieves superior structural and semantic prediction performance compared to existing methods, while simultaneously reducing computational and memory costs by 51.3% and 27.5%, respectively. Furthermore, our approach achieves complete reconstruction and accurate classification of thin structures such as poles and wires-which existing methods struggle to perceive-highlighting its potential for dense and accurate 3D radar perception.

- **[Robult: Leveraging Redundancy and Modality Specific Features for Robust Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03477)**  `arXiv:2509.03477`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Duy A. Nguyen, Abhi Kamboj, Minh N. Do_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled (PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2) a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

- **[FoMEMO: Towards Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03244)**  `arXiv:2509.03244`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yiming Yao, Fei Liu, Liang Zhao, Xi Lin, Qingfu Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO (Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive performance compared to existing methods.

- **[Learning Laplacian Eigenvectors: a Pre-training Method for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02803)**  `arXiv:2509.02803`  `cs.LG`  
  _Howard Dai, Nyambura Njenga, Benjamin Whitsett, Catherine Ma, Darwin Deng, Sara de √Ångel, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by inductively learning Laplacian eigenvectors. Traditional Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph. Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when task-specific data is sparse.

  Text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) have recently emerged as powerful generative models with great potential for solving inverse problems in imaging. However, leveraging such models in a Plug & Play (PnP), zero-shot manner remains challenging because it requires identifying a suitable text prompt for the unknown image of interest. Also, existing text-to-image PnP approaches are highly computationally expensive. We herein address these challenges by proposing a novel PnP inference paradigm specifically designed for embedding generative models within stochastic inverse solvers, with special attention to Latent Consistency Models (LCMs), which distill LDMs into fast generators. We leverage our framework to propose LAtent consisTency INverse sOlver (LATINO), the first zero-shot PnP framework to solve inverse problems with priors encoded by LCMs. Our conditioning mechanism avoids automatic differentiation and reaches SOTA quality in as little as 8 neural function evaluations. As a result, LATINO delivers remarkably accurate solutions and is significantly more memory and computationally efficient than previous approaches. We then embed LATINO within an empirical Bayesian framework that automatically calibrates the text prompt from the observed measurements by marginal maximum likelihood estimation. Extensive experiments show that prompt self-calibration greatly improves estimation, allowing LATINO with PRompt Optimization to define new SOTAs in image reconstruction quality and computational efficiency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Organoids replicate organ structure and function, playing a crucial role in fields such as tumor treatment and drug screening. Their shape and size can indicate their developmental status, but traditional fluorescence labeling methods risk compromising their structure. Therefore, this paper proposes an automated, non-destructive approach to organoid segmentation and tracking. We introduced the LGBP-OrgaNet, a deep learning-based system proficient in accurately segmenting, tracking, and quantifying organoids. The model leverages complementary information extracted from CNN and Transformer modules and introduces the innovative feature fusion module, Learnable Gaussian Band Pass Fusion, to merge data from two branches. Additionally, in the decoder, the model proposes a Bidirectional Cross Fusion Block to fuse multi-scale features, and finally completes the decoding through progressive concatenation and upsampling. SROrga demonstrates satisfactory segmentation accuracy and robustness on organoids segmentation datasets, providing a potent tool for organoid research.

- **[AutoDetect: Designing an Autoencoder-based Detection Method for Poisoning Attacks on Object Detection Applications in the Military Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03179)**  `arXiv:2509.03179`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Alma M. Liezenga, Stefan Wijnja, Puck de Haan, Niels W. T. Brink, Jip J. van Stijn, Yori Kamphuis, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences. In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack: a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large, representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

- **[Decoding Visual Neural Representations by Multimodal with Dynamic Balancing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03433)**  `arXiv:2509.03433`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kaili sun, Xingyu Miao, Bing Zhai, Haoran Duan, Yang Long_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image, and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content. With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB) strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by 2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

- **[Towards Realistic Hand-Object Interaction with Gravity-Field Based Diffusion Bridge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03114)**  `arXiv:2509.03114`  `cs.CV`  
  _Miao Xu, Xiangyu Zhu, Xusheng Liang, Zidu Wang, Jinlin Wu, Zhen Lei_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

- **[Discrete Noise Inversion for Next-scale Autoregressive Text-based Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01984)**  `arXiv:2509.01984`  `cs.CV`

  Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing approach.

- **[UPGS: Unified Pose-aware Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Scene Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00831)**  `arXiv:2509.00831`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhijing Wu, Longguang Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

  Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety, or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.

  Accurate depth estimation is at the core of many applications in computer graphics, vision, and robotics. Current state-of-the-art monocular depth estimators, trained on extensive datasets, generalize well but lack 3D consistency needed for many applications. In this paper, we combine the strength of those generalizing monocular depth estimation techniques with multi-view data by framing this as an analysis-by-synthesis optimization problem to lift and refine such relative depth maps to accurate error-free depth maps. After an initial global scale estimation through structure-from-motion point clouds, we further refine the depth map through optimization enforcing multi-view consistency via photometric and geometric losses with differentiable rendering of the meshed depth map. In a two-stage optimization, scaling is further refined first, and afterwards artifacts and errors in the depth map are corrected via nearby-view photometric supervision. Our evaluation shows that our method is able to generate detailed, high-quality, view consistent, accurate depth maps, also in challenging indoor scenarios, and outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view depth reconstruction approaches on such datasets.Project page and source code can be found atthis https URL.
