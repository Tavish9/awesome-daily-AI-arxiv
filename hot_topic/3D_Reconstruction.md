  We propose SemGauss-SLAM, a dense semantic SLAM system utilizing 3D Gaussian representation, that enables accurate 3D semantic mapping, robust camera tracking, and high-quality rendering simultaneously. In this system, we incorporate semantic feature embedding into 3D Gaussian representation, which effectively encodes semantic information within the spatial layout of the environment for precise semantic scene representation. Furthermore, we propose feature-level loss for updating 3D Gaussian representation, enabling higher-level guidance for 3D Gaussian optimization. In addition, to reduce cumulative drift in tracking and improve semantic reconstruction accuracy, we introduce semantic-informed bundle adjustment. By leveraging multi-frame semantic associations, this strategy enables joint optimization of 3D Gaussian representation and camera poses, resulting in low-drift tracking and accurate semantic mapping. Our SemGauss-SLAM demonstrates superior performance over existing radiance field-based SLAM methods in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy on Replica and ScanNet datasets, while also showing excellent capabilities in high-precision semantic segmentation and dense semantic mapping.

- **[ManiGaussian++: General Robotic Bimanual Manipulation with Hierarchical Gaussian World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19842)**  `arXiv:2506.19842`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-task robotic bimanual manipulation is becoming increasingly popular as it enables sophisticated tasks that require diverse dual-arm collaboration patterns. Compared to unimanual manipulation, bimanual tasks pose challenges to understanding the multi-body spatiotemporal dynamics. An existing method ManiGaussian pioneers encoding the spatiotemporal dynamics into the visual representation via Gaussian world model for single-arm settings, which ignores the interaction of multiple embodiments for dual-arm systems with significant performance drop. In this paper, we propose ManiGaussian++, an extension of ManiGaussian framework that improves multi-task bimanual manipulation by digesting multi-body scene dynamics through a hierarchical Gaussian world model. To be specific, we first generate task-oriented Gaussian Splatting from intermediate visual features, which aims to differentiate acting and stabilizing arms for multi-body spatiotemporal dynamics modeling. We then build a hierarchical Gaussian world model with the leader-follower architecture, where the multi-body spatiotemporal dynamics is mined for intermediate visual representation via future scene prediction. The leader predicts Gaussian Splatting deformation caused by motions of the stabilizing arm, through which the follower generates the physical consequences resulted from the movement of the acting arm. As a result, our method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art bimanual manipulation techniques by an improvement of 20.2% in 10 simulated tasks, and achieves 60% success rate on average in 9 challenging real-world tasks.

- **[The MOTIF Hand: A Robotic Hand for Multimodal Observations with Thermal, Inertial, and Force Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19201)**  `arXiv:2506.19201`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advancing dexterous manipulation with multi-fingered robotic hands requires rich sensory capabilities, while existing designs lack onboard thermal and torque sensing. In this work, we propose the MOTIF hand, a novel multimodal and versatile robotic hand that extends the LEAP hand by integrating: (i) dense tactile information across the fingers, (ii) a depth sensor, (iii) a thermal camera, (iv), IMU sensors, and (v) a visual sensor. The MOTIF hand is designed to be relatively low-cost (under 4000 USD) and easily reproducible. We validate our hand design through experiments that leverage its multimodal sensing for two representative tasks. First, we integrate thermal sensing into 3D reconstruction to guide temperature-aware, safe grasping. Second, we show how our hand can distinguish objects with identical appearance but different masses - a capability beyond methods that use vision only.

- **[Multimodal Anomaly Detection with a Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19077)**  `arXiv:2506.19077`  `cs.RO`  
  _Christoph Willibald, Daniel Sliwowski, Dongheui Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With a growing number of robots being deployed across diverse applications, robust multimodal anomaly detection becomes increasingly important. In robotic manipulation, failures typically arise from (1) robot-driven anomalies due to an insufficient task model or hardware limitations, and (2) environment-driven anomalies caused by dynamic environmental changes or external interferences. Conventional anomaly detection methods focus either on the first by low-level statistical modeling of proprioceptive signals or the second by deep learning-based visual environment observation, each with different computational and training data requirements. To effectively capture anomalies from both sources, we propose a mixture-of-experts framework that integrates the complementary detection mechanisms with a visual-language model for environment monitoring and a Gaussian-mixture regression-based detector for tracking deviations in interaction forces and robot motions. We introduce a confidence-based fusion mechanism that dynamically selects the most reliable detector for each situation. We evaluate our approach on both household and industrial tasks using two robotic systems, demonstrating a 60% reduction in detection delay while improving frame-wise anomaly detection performance compared to individual detectors.

- **[DroneDiffusion: Robust Quadrotor Dynamics Learning with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11292)**  `arXiv:2409.11292`  `cs.RO`  
  _Avirup Das, Rishabh Dev Yadav, Sihao Sun, Mingfei Sun, Samuel Kaski, Wei Pan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  An inherent fragility of quadrotor systems stems from model inaccuracies and external disturbances. These factors hinder performance and compromise the stability of the system, making precise control challenging. Existing model-based approaches either make deterministic assumptions, utilize Gaussian-based representations of uncertainty, or rely on nominal models, all of which often fall short in capturing the complex, multimodal nature of real-world dynamics. This work introduces DroneDiffusion, a novel framework that leverages conditional diffusion models to learn quadrotor dynamics, formulated as a sequence generation task. DroneDiffusion achieves superior generalization to unseen, complex scenarios by capturing the temporal nature of uncertainties and mitigating error propagation. We integrate the learned dynamics with an adaptive controller for trajectory tracking with stability guarantees. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world flights demonstrate the robustness of the framework across a range of scenarios, including unfamiliar flight paths and varying payloads, velocities, and wind disturbances.

- **[Stochastic Motion Planning as Gaussian Variational Inference: Theory and Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14985)**  `arXiv:2308.14985`  `cs.RO`  
  _Hongzhe Yu, Yongxin Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel formulation for motion planning under uncertainties based on variational inference where the optimal motion plan is modeled as a posterior distribution. We propose a Gaussian variational inference-based framework, termed Gaussian Variational Inference Motion Planning (GVI-MP), to approximate this posterior by a Gaussian distribution over the trajectories. We show that the GVI-MP framework is dual to a special class of stochastic control problems and brings robustness into the decision-making in motion planning. We develop two algorithms to numerically solve this variational inference and the equivalent control formulations for motion planning. The first algorithm uses a natural gradient paradigm to iteratively update a Gaussian proposal distribution on the sparse motion planning factor graph. We propose a second algorithm, the Proximal Covariance Steering Motion Planner (PCS-MP), to solve the same inference problem in its stochastic control form with an additional terminal constraint. We leverage a proximal gradient paradigm where, at each iteration, we quadratically approximate nonlinear state costs and solve a linear covariance steering problem in closed form. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various robot models. An implementation is provided inthis https URL.

- **[Realistic Image-to-Image Machine Unlearning via Decoupling and Knowledge Retention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04260)**  `arXiv:2502.04260`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine Unlearning allows participants to remove their data from a trained machine learning model in order to preserve their privacy, and security. However, the machine unlearning literature for generative models is rather limited. The literature for image-to-image generative model (I2I model) considers minimizing the distance between Gaussian noise and the output of I2I model for forget samples as machine unlearning. However, we argue that the machine learning model performs fairly well on unseen data i.e., a retrained model will be able to catch generic patterns in the data and hence will not generate an output which is equivalent to Gaussian noise. In this paper, we consider that the model after unlearning should treat forget samples as out-of-distribution (OOD) data, i.e., the unlearned model should no longer recognize or encode the specific patterns found in the forget samples. To achieve this, we propose a framework which decouples the model parameters with gradient ascent, ensuring that forget samples are OOD for unlearned model with theoretical guarantee. We also provide $(\epsilon, \delta)$-unlearning guarantee for model updates with gradient ascent. The unlearned model is further fine-tuned on the remaining samples to maintain its performance. We also propose an attack model to ensure that the unlearned model has effectively removed the influence of forget samples. Extensive empirical evaluation on two large-scale datasets, ImageNet-1K and Places365 highlights the superiority of our approach. To show comparable performance with retrained model, we also show the comparison of a simple AutoEncoder on various baselines on CIFAR-10 dataset.

  Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns, limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data. Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets, enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11% reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a 10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real training sets are not available.

- **[ReMAR-DS: Recalibrated Feature Learning for Metal Artifact Reduction and CT Domain Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19531)**  `arXiv:2506.19531`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Mubashara Rehman, Niki Martinel, Michele Avanzo, Riccardo Spizzo, Christian Micheloni_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Artifacts in kilo-Voltage CT (kVCT) imaging degrade image quality, impacting clinical decisions. We propose a deep learning framework for metal artifact reduction (MAR) and domain transformation from kVCT to Mega-Voltage CT (MVCT). The proposed framework, ReMAR-DS, utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with enhanced feature recalibration, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving anatomical structures. This ensures that only relevant information is utilized in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions. Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Clinically, this enables oncologists to rely on kVCT alone, reducing repeated high-dose MVCT scans and lowering radiation exposure for cancer patients.

- **[Self-Supervised Multimodal NeRF for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19615)**  `arXiv:2506.19615`  `cs.CV`  
  _Gaurav Sharma, Ravi Kothari, Josef Schmid_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based framework, referred to as Novel View Synthesis Framework (NVSF). It jointly learns the implicit neural representation of space and time-varying scene for both LiDAR and Camera. We test this on a real-world autonomous driving scenario containing both static and dynamic scenes. Compared to existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs, our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline models, our framework has reported best performance on both LiDAR and Camera domain.

- **[Online camera-pose-free stereo endoscopic tissue deformation recovery with tissue-invariant vision-biomechanics consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19388)**  `arXiv:2506.19388`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jiahe Chen, Naoki Tomii, Ichiro Sakuma, Etsuko Kobayashi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tissue deformation recovery based on stereo endoscopic images is crucial for tool-tissue interaction analysis and benefits surgical navigation and autonomous soft tissue manipulation. Previous research suffers from the problems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack of tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing. Unlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are represented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue geometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D displacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6 parameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local deformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where all motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera. Inter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation, making it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map is introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online approach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo and ex vivo laparoscopic datasets. With the inputs of depth and optical flow, the method stably models tissue geometry and deformation even when the tissue is partially occluded or moving outside the field of view. Results show that the 3D reconstruction accuracy in the non-occluded and occluded areas reaches 0.37$\pm$0.27 mm and 0.39$\pm$0.21 mm in terms of surface distance, respectively. The method can also estimate surface strain distribution during various manipulations as an extra modality for mechanical-based analysis.

- **[HoliGS: Holistic Gaussian Splatting for Embodied View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19291)**  `arXiv:2506.19291`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xiaoyuan Wang, Yizhou Zhao, Botao Ye, Xiaojun Shan, Weijie Lyu, Lu Qi, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose HoliGS, a novel deformable Gaussian splatting framework that addresses embodied view synthesis from long monocular RGB videos. Unlike prior 4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRF pipelines, which struggle with training overhead in minute-long captures, our method leverages invertible Gaussian Splatting deformation networks to reconstruct large-scale, dynamic environments accurately. Specifically, we decompose each scene into a static background plus time-varying objects, each represented by learned Gaussian primitives undergoing global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and subtle non-rigid deformations via an invertible neural flow. This hierarchical warping strategy enables robust free-viewpoint novel-view rendering from various embodied camera trajectories by attaching Gaussians to a complete canonical foreground shape (\eg, egocentric or third-person follow), which may involve substantial viewpoint changes and interactions between multiple actors. Our experiments demonstrate that \ourmethod~ achieves superior reconstruction quality on challenging datasets while significantly reducing both training and rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs. These results highlight a practical and scalable solution for EVS in real-world scenarios. The source code will be released.

- **[Inverse-and-Edit: Effective and Fast Image Editing by Cycle Consistency Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19103)**  `arXiv:2506.19103`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ilia Beletskii, Andrey Kuznetsov, Aibek Alanov_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in image editing with diffusion models have achieved impressive results, offering fine-grained control over the generation process. However, these methods are computationally intensive because of their iterative nature. While distilled diffusion models enable faster inference, their editing capabilities remain limited, primarily because of poor inversion quality. High-fidelity inversion and reconstruction are essential for precise image editing, as they preserve the structural and semantic integrity of the source image. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps. Our method introduces a cycle-consistency optimization strategy that significantly improves reconstruction accuracy and enables a controllable trade-off between editability and content preservation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across various image editing tasks and datasets, demonstrating that our method matches or surpasses full-step diffusion models while being substantially more efficient. The code of our method is available on GitHub atthis https URL.

- **[RA-NeRF: Robust Neural Radiance Field Reconstruction with Accurate Camera Pose Estimation under Complex Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15242)**  `arXiv:2506.15242`  `cs.CV`  
  _Qingsong Yan, Qiang Wang, Kaiyong Zhao, Jie Chen, Bo Li, Xiaowen Chu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories. Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

- **[Pro-AD: Learning Comprehensive Prototypes with Prototype-based Constraint for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13097)**  `arXiv:2506.13097`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ziqing Zhou, Yurui Pan, Lidong Wang, Wenbing Zhu, Mingmin Chi, Dong Wu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prototype-based reconstruction methods for unsupervised anomaly detection utilize a limited set of learnable prototypes which only aggregates insufficient normal information, resulting in undesirable reconstruction. However, increasing the number of prototypes may lead to anomalies being well reconstructed through the attention mechanism, which we refer to as the "Soft Identity Mapping" problem. In this paper, we propose Pro-AD to address these issues and fully utilize the prototypes to boost the performance of anomaly detection. Specifically, we first introduce an expanded set of learnable prototypes to provide sufficient capacity for semantic information. Then we employ a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder which integrates the process of the normal information aggregation and the target feature reconstruction via prototypes, with the aim of allowing the prototypes to aggregate more comprehensive normal semantic information from different levels of the image features and the target feature reconstruction to not only utilize its contextual information but also dynamically leverage the learned comprehensive prototypes. Additionally, to prevent the anomalies from being well reconstructed using sufficient semantic information through the attention mechanism, Pro-AD introduces a Prototype-based Constraint that applied within the target feature reconstruction process of the decoder, which further improves the performance of our approach. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our Pro-AD achieve state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its superior robustness and practical effectiveness for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection task.

- **[Super-Resolution with Structured Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15961)**  `arXiv:2505.15961`  `cs.CV`  
  _Gabby Litterio, Juan-David Lizarazo-Ferro, Pedro Felzenszwalb, Rashid Zia_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We consider the limits of super-resolution using imaging constraints. Due to various theoretical and practical limitations, reconstruction-based methods have been largely restricted to small increases in resolution. In addition, motion-blur is usually seen as a nuisance that impedes super-resolution. We show that by using high-precision motion information, sparse image priors, and convex optimization, it is possible to increase resolution by large factors. A key operation in super-resolution is deconvolution with a box. In general, convolution with a box is not invertible. However, we obtain perfect reconstructions of sparse signals using convex optimization. We also show that motion blur can be helpful for super-resolution. We demonstrate that using pseudo-random motion it is possible to reconstruct a high-resolution target using a single low-resolution image. We present numerical experiments with simulated data and results with real data captured by a camera mounted on a computer controlled stage.

- **[Beyond Reconstruction: A Physics Based Neural Deferred Shader for Photo-realistic Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12273)**  `arXiv:2504.12273`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhuo He, Paul Henderson, Nicolas Pugeault_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning based rendering has achieved major improvements in photo-realistic image synthesis, with potential applications including visual effects in movies and photo-realistic scene building in video games. However, a significant limitation is the difficulty of decomposing the illumination and material parameters, which limits such methods to reconstructing an input scene, without any possibility to control these parameters. This paper introduces a novel physics based neural deferred shading pipeline to decompose the data-driven rendering process, learn a generalizable shading function to produce photo-realistic results for shading and relighting tasks; we also propose a shadow estimator to efficiently mimic shadowing effects. Our model achieves improved performance compared to classical models and a state-of-art neural shading model, and enables generalizable photo-realistic shading from arbitrary illumination input.

- **[Dynamic PET Image Reconstruction via Non-negative INR Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08025)**  `arXiv:2503.08025`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chaozhi Zhang, Wenxiang Ding, Roy Y. He, Xiaoqun Zhang, Qiaoqiao Ding_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The reconstruction of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) images from noisy projection data is a significant but challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised learning approach, Non-negative Implicit Neural Representation Factorization (\texttt{NINRF}), based on low rank matrix factorization of unknown images and employing neural networks to represent both coefficients and bases. Mathematically, we demonstrate that if a sequence of dynamic PET images satisfies a generalized non-negative low-rank property, it can be decomposed into a set of non-negative continuous functions varying in the temporal-spatial domain. This bridges the well-established non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with continuous functions and we propose using implicit neural representations (INRs) to connect matrix with continuous functions. The neural network parameters are obtained by minimizing the KL divergence, with additional sparsity regularization on coefficients and bases. Extensive experiments on dynamic PET reconstruction with Poisson noise demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to other methods, while giving continuous representations for object's detailed geometric features and regional concentration variation.

- **[GCE-Pose: Global Context Enhancement for Category-level Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04293)**  `arXiv:2502.04293`  `cs.CV`  
  _Weihang Li, Hongli Xu, Junwen Huang, Hyunjun Jung, Peter KT Yu, Nassir Navab, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A key challenge in model-free category-level pose estimation is the extraction of contextual object features that generalize across varying instances within a specific category. Recent approaches leverage foundational features to capture semantic and geometry cues from data. However, these approaches fail under partial visibility. We overcome this with a first-complete-then-aggregate strategy for feature extraction utilizing class priors. In this paper, we present GCE-Pose, a method that enhances pose estimation for novel instances by integrating category-level global context prior. GCE-Pose performs semantic shape reconstruction with a proposed Semantic Shape Reconstruction (SSR) module. Given an unseen partial RGB-D object instance, our SSR module reconstructs the instance's global geometry and semantics by deforming category-specific 3D semantic prototypes through a learned deep Linear Shape Model. We further introduce a Global Context Enhanced (GCE) feature fusion module that effectively fuses features from partial RGB-D observations and the reconstructed global context. Extensive experiments validate the impact of our global context prior and the effectiveness of the GCE fusion module, demonstrating that GCE-Pose significantly outperforms existing methods on challenging real-world datasets HouseCat6D and NOCS-REAL275.
