- **[Constrained Gaussian Process Motion Planning via Stein Variational Newton Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04936)**  `arXiv:2504.04936`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Gaussian Process Motion Planning (GPMP) is a widely used framework for generating smooth trajectories within a limited compute time--an essential requirement in many robotic applications. However, traditional GPMP approaches often struggle with enforcing hard nonlinear constraints and rely on Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) solutions that disregard the full Bayesian posterior. This limits planning diversity and ultimately hampers decision-making. Recent efforts to integrate Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) into motion planning have shown promise in handling complex constraints. Nonetheless, these methods still face persistent challenges, such as difficulties in strictly enforcing constraints and inefficiencies when the probabilistic inference problem is poorly conditioned. To address these issues, we propose a novel constrained Stein Variational Gaussian Process Motion Planning (cSGPMP) framework, incorporating a GPMP prior specifically designed for trajectory optimization under hard constraints. Our approach improves the efficiency of particle-based inference while explicitly handling nonlinear constraints. This advancement significantly broadens the applicability of GPMP to motion planning scenarios demanding robust Bayesian inference, strict constraint adherence, and computational efficiency within a limited time. We validate our method on standard benchmarks, achieving an average success rate of 98.57% across 350 planning tasks, significantly outperforming competitive baselines. This demonstrates the ability of our method to discover and use diverse trajectory modes, enhancing flexibility and adaptability in complex environments, and delivering significant improvements over standard baselines without incurring major computational costs.

  Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology now has photorealistic mapping capabilities thanks to the real-time high-fidelity rendering capability of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). However, due to the static representation of scenes, current 3DGS-based SLAM encounters issues with pose drift and failure to reconstruct accurate maps in dynamic environments. To address this problem, we present D4DGS-SLAM, the first SLAM method based on 4DGS map representation for dynamic environments. By incorporating the temporal dimension into scene representation, D4DGS-SLAM enables high-quality reconstruction of dynamic scenes. Utilizing the dynamics-aware InfoModule, we can obtain the dynamics, visibility, and reliability of scene points, and filter stable static points for tracking accordingly. When optimizing Gaussian points, we apply different isotropic regularization terms to Gaussians with varying dynamic characteristics. Experimental results on real-world dynamic scene datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both camera pose tracking and map quality.

  Tool use is critical for enabling robots to perform complex real-world tasks, and leveraging human tool-use data can be instrumental for teaching robots. However, existing data collection methods like teleoperation are slow, prone to control delays, and unsuitable for dynamic tasks. In contrast, human natural data, where humans directly perform tasks with tools, offers natural, unstructured interactions that are both efficient and easy to collect. Building on the insight that humans and robots can share the same tools, we propose a framework to transfer tool-use knowledge from human data to robots. Using two RGB cameras, our method generates 3D reconstruction, applies Gaussian splatting for novel view augmentation, employs segmentation models to extract embodiment-agnostic observations, and leverages task-space tool-action representations to train visuomotor policies. We validate our approach on diverse real-world tasks, including meatball scooping, pan flipping, wine bottle balancing, and other complex tasks. Our method achieves a 71\% higher average success rate compared to diffusion policies trained with teleoperation data and reduces data collection time by 77\%, with some tasks solvable only by our framework. Compared to hand-held gripper, our method cuts data collection time by 41\%. Additionally, our method bridges the embodiment gap, improves robustness to variations in camera viewpoints and robot configurations, and generalizes effectively across objects and spatial setups.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models approximate the denoising distribution as a Gaussian and predict its mean, whereas flow matching models reparameterize the Gaussian mean as flow velocity. However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an $L_2$ denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256$\times$256.

- **[Variational Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04318)**  `arXiv:2504.04318`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Mehmet Can Yavuz, Berrin Yanikoglu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Variational Self-Supervised Learning (VSSL), a novel framework that combines variational inference with self-supervised learning to enable efficient, decoder-free representation learning. Unlike traditional VAEs that rely on input reconstruction via a decoder, VSSL symmetrically couples two encoders with Gaussian outputs. A momentum-updated teacher network defines a dynamic, data-dependent prior, while the student encoder produces an approximate posterior from augmented views. The reconstruction term in the ELBO is replaced with a cross-view denoising objective, preserving the analytical tractability of Gaussian KL divergence. We further introduce cosine-based formulations of KL and log-likelihood terms to enhance semantic alignment in high-dimensional latent spaces. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 show that VSSL achieves competitive or superior performance to leading self-supervised methods, including BYOL and MoCo V3. VSSL offers a scalable, probabilistically grounded approach to learning transferable representations without generative reconstruction, bridging the gap between variational modeling and modern self-supervised techniques.

- **[Semantic-guided Representation Learning for Multi-Label Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03801)**  `arXiv:2504.03801`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-label Recognition (MLR) involves assigning multiple labels to each data instance in an image, offering advantages over single-label classification in complex scenarios. However, it faces the challenge of annotating all relevant categories, often leading to uncertain annotations, such as unseen or incomplete labels. Recent Vision and Language Pre-training (VLP) based methods have made significant progress in tackling zero-shot MLR tasks by leveraging rich vision-language correlations. However, the correlation between multi-label semantics has not been fully explored, and the learned visual features often lack essential semantic information. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Semantic-guided Representation Learning approach (SigRL) that enables the model to learn effective visual and textual representations, thereby improving the downstream alignment of visual images and categories. Specifically, we first introduce a graph-based multi-label correlation module (GMC) to facilitate information exchange between labels, enriching the semantic representation across the multi-label texts. Next, we propose a Semantic Visual Feature Reconstruction module (SVFR) to enhance the semantic information in the visual representation by integrating the learned textual representation during reconstruction. Finally, we optimize the image-text matching capability of the VLP model using both local and global features to achieve zero-shot MLR. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on several MLR benchmarks, encompassing both zero-shot MLR (with unseen labels) and single positive multi-label learning (with limited labels), demonstrating the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **[Noisy Test-Time Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14604)**  `arXiv:2502.14604`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to address distribution shifts between source and target data by relying solely on target data during testing. In open-world scenarios, models often encounter noisy samples, i.e., samples outside the in-distribution (ID) label space. Leveraging the zero-shot capability of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), this paper introduces Zero-Shot Noisy TTA (ZS-NTTA), focusing on adapting the model to target data with noisy samples during test-time in a zero-shot manner. We find existing TTA methods underperform under ZS-NTTA, often lagging behind even the frozen model. We conduct comprehensive experiments to analyze this phenomenon, revealing that the negative impact of unfiltered noisy data outweighs the benefits of clean data during model updating. Also, adapting a classifier for ID classification and noise detection hampers both sub-tasks. Built on this, we propose a framework that decouples the classifier and detector, focusing on developing an individual detector while keeping the classifier frozen. Technically, we introduce the Adaptive Noise Detector (AdaND), which utilizes the frozen model's outputs as pseudo-labels to train a noise detector. To handle clean data streams, we further inject Gaussian noise during adaptation, preventing the detector from misclassifying clean samples as noisy. Beyond the ZS-NTTA, AdaND can also improve the zero-shot out-of-distribution (ZS-OOD) detection ability of VLMs. Experiments show that AdaND outperforms in both ZS-NTTA and ZS-OOD detection. On ImageNet, AdaND achieves a notable improvement of $8.32\%$ in harmonic mean accuracy ($\text{Acc}_\text{H}$) for ZS-NTTA and $9.40\%$ in FPR95 for ZS-OOD detection, compared to SOTA methods. Importantly, AdaND is computationally efficient and comparable to the model-frozen method. The code is publicly available at:this https URL.

  _Jianhao Zheng, Zihan Zhu, Valentin Bieri, Marc Pollefeys, Songyou Peng, Iro Armeni_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present WildGS-SLAM, a robust and efficient monocular RGB SLAM system designed to handle dynamic environments by leveraging uncertainty-aware geometric mapping. Unlike traditional SLAM systems, which assume static scenes, our approach integrates depth and uncertainty information to enhance tracking, mapping, and rendering performance in the presence of moving objects. We introduce an uncertainty map, predicted by a shallow multi-layer perceptron and DINOv2 features, to guide dynamic object removal during both tracking and mapping. This uncertainty map enhances dense bundle adjustment and Gaussian map optimization, improving reconstruction accuracy. Our system is evaluated on multiple datasets and demonstrates artifact-free view synthesis. Results showcase WildGS-SLAM's superior performance in dynamic environments compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  Despite recent advancements in surface reconstruction, Level of Detail (LoD) 3 building reconstruction remains an unresolved challenge. The main issue pertains to the object-oriented modelling paradigm, which requires georeferencing, watertight geometry, facade semantics, and low-poly representation -- Contrasting unstructured mesh-oriented models. In Texture2LoD3, we introduce a novel method leveraging the ubiquity of 3D building model priors and panoramic street-level images, enabling the reconstruction of LoD3 building models. We observe that prior low-detail building models can serve as valid planar targets for ortho-rectifying street-level panoramic images. Moreover, deploying segmentation on accurately textured low-level building surfaces supports maintaining essential georeferencing, watertight geometry, and low-poly representation for LoD3 reconstruction. In the absence of LoD3 validation data, we additionally introduce the ReLoD3 dataset, on which we experimentally demonstrate that our method leads to improved facade segmentation accuracy by 11% and can replace costly manual projections. We believe that Texture2LoD3 can scale the adoption of LoD3 models, opening applications in estimating building solar potential or enhancing autonomous driving simulations.

- **[Adversarial Robustness for Deep Learning-based Wildfire Prediction Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20006)**  `arXiv:2412.20006`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rapidly growing wildfires have recently devastated societal assets, exposing a critical need for early warning systems to expedite relief efforts. Smoke detection using camera-based Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) offers a promising solution for wildfire prediction. However, the rarity of smoke across time and space limits training data, raising model overfitting and bias concerns. Current DNNs, primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, complicate robustness evaluation due to architectural differences. To address these challenges, we introduce WARP (Wildfire Adversarial Robustness Procedure), the first model-agnostic framework for evaluating wildfire detection models' adversarial robustness. WARP addresses inherent limitations in data diversity by generating adversarial examples through image-global and -local perturbations. Global and local attacks superimpose Gaussian noise and PNG patches onto image inputs, respectively; this suits both CNNs and transformers while generating realistic adversarial scenarios. Using WARP, we assessed real-time CNNs and Transformers, uncovering key vulnerabilities. At times, transformers exhibited over 70% precision degradation under global attacks, while both models generally struggled to differentiate cloud-like PNG patches from real smoke during local attacks. To enhance model robustness, we proposed four wildfire-oriented data augmentation techniques based on WARP's methodology and results, which diversify smoke image data and improve model precision and robustness. These advancements represent a substantial step toward developing a reliable early wildfire warning system, which may be our first safeguard against wildfire destruction.

- **[Explaining Low Perception Model Competency with High-Competency Counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05254)**  `arXiv:2504.05254`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Sara Pohland, Claire Tomlin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There exist many methods to explain how an image classification model generates its decision, but very little work has explored methods to explain why a classifier might lack confidence in its prediction. As there are various reasons the classifier might lose confidence, it would be valuable for this model to not only indicate its level of uncertainty but also explain why it is uncertain. Counterfactual images have been used to visualize changes that could be made to an image to generate a different classification decision. In this work, we explore the use of counterfactuals to offer an explanation for low model competency--a generalized form of predictive uncertainty that measures confidence. Toward this end, we develop five novel methods to generate high-competency counterfactual images, namely Image Gradient Descent (IGD), Feature Gradient Descent (FGD), Autoencoder Reconstruction (Reco), Latent Gradient Descent (LGD), and Latent Nearest Neighbors (LNN). We evaluate these methods across two unique datasets containing images with six known causes for low model competency and find Reco, LGD, and LNN to be the most promising methods for counterfactual generation. We further evaluate how these three methods can be utilized by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate language explanations for low model competency. We find that the inclusion of a counterfactual image in the language model query greatly increases the ability of the model to generate an accurate explanation for the cause of low model competency, thus demonstrating the utility of counterfactual images in explaining low perception model competency.

  Current 3D reconstruction techniques struggle to infer unbounded scenes from a few images faithfully. Specifically, existing methods have high computational demands, require detailed pose information, and cannot reconstruct occluded regions reliably. We introduce 6Img-to-3D, an efficient, scalable transformer-based encoder-renderer method for single-shot image to 3D reconstruction. Our method outputs a 3D-consistent parameterized triplane from only six outward-facing input images for large-scale, unbounded outdoor driving scenarios. We take a step towards resolving existing shortcomings by combining contracted custom cross- and self-attention mechanisms for triplane parameterization, differentiable volume rendering, scene contraction, and image feature projection. We showcase that six surround-view vehicle images from a single timestamp without global pose information are enough to reconstruct 360$^{\circ}$ scenes during inference time, taking 395 ms. Our method allows, for example, rendering third-person images and birds-eye views. Our code is available atthis https URL, and more examples can be found at our website herethis https URL.

- **[PanoDreamer: Consistent Text to 360-Degree Scene Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05152)**  `arXiv:2504.05152`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhexiao Xiong, Zhang Chen, Zhong Li, Yi Xu, Nathan Jacobs_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automatically generating a complete 3D scene from a text description, a reference image, or both has significant applications in fields like virtual reality and gaming. However, current methods often generate low-quality textures and inconsistent 3D structures. This is especially true when extrapolating significantly beyond the field of view of the reference image. To address these challenges, we propose PanoDreamer, a novel framework for consistent, 3D scene generation with flexible text and image control. Our approach employs a large language model and a warp-refine pipeline, first generating an initial set of images and then compositing them into a 360-degree panorama. This panorama is then lifted into 3D to form an initial point cloud. We then use several approaches to generate additional images, from different viewpoints, that are consistent with the initial point cloud and expand/refine the initial point cloud. Given the resulting set of images, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to create the final 3D scene, which can then be rendered from different viewpoints. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PanoDreamer in generating high-quality, geometrically consistent 3D scenes.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent novel view synthesis (NVS) techniques, including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly advanced 3D scene reconstruction with high-quality rendering and realistic detail recovery. Effectively removing occlusions while preserving scene details can further enhance the robustness and applicability of these techniques. However, existing approaches for object and occlusion removal predominantly rely on generative priors, which, despite filling the resulting holes, introduce new artifacts and blurriness. Moreover, existing benchmark datasets for evaluating occlusion removal methods lack realistic complexity and viewpoint variations. To address these issues, we introduce DeclutterSet, a novel dataset featuring diverse scenes with pronounced occlusions distributed across foreground, midground, and background, exhibiting substantial relative motion across viewpoints. We further introduce DeclutterNeRF, an occlusion removal method free from generative priors. DeclutterNeRF introduces joint multi-view optimization of learnable camera parameters, occlusion annealing regularization, and employs an explainable stochastic structural similarity loss, ensuring high-quality, artifact-free reconstructions from incomplete images. Experiments demonstrate that DeclutterNeRF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on our proposed DeclutterSet, establishing a strong baseline for future research.

- **[Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration with Anchored 3D Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04597)**  `arXiv:2504.04597`  `cs.CV`  
  _Haebeom Jung, Namtae Kim, Jungwoo Kim, Jaesik Park_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method that jointly optimizes sensor poses and scene geometry from arbitrary scenes, without relying on traditional calibration targets such as checkerboards or spherical reflectors. Our approach leverages a 3D Gaussian-based scene representation. We first freeze reliable LiDAR points as anchors, then jointly optimize the poses and auxiliary Gaussian parameters in a fully differentiable manner using a photometric loss. This joint optimization significantly reduces sensor misalignment, resulting in higher rendering quality and consistently improved PSNR compared to the carefully calibrated poses provided in popular datasets. We validate our method through extensive experiments on two real-world autonomous driving datasets, KITTI-360 and Waymo, each featuring distinct sensor configurations. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach using a custom LiDAR-camera setup, confirming strong performance across diverse hardware configurations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the advancements in 3D full-shape generation, accurately modeling complex geometries and semantics of shape parts remains a significant challenge, particularly for shapes with varying numbers of parts. Current methods struggle to effectively integrate the contextual and structural information of 3D shapes into their generative processes. We address these limitations with PRISM, a novel compositional approach for 3D shape generation that integrates categorical diffusion models with Statistical Shape Models (SSM) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). Our method employs compositional SSMs to capture part-level geometric variations and uses GMM to represent part semantics in a continuous space. This integration enables both high fidelity and diversity in generated shapes while preserving structural coherence. Through extensive experiments on shape generation and manipulation tasks, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous methods in both quality and controllability of part-level operations. Our code will be made publicly available.

- **[NCL-CIR: Noise-aware Contrastive Learning for Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04339)**  `arXiv:2504.04339`  `cs.CV`  
  _Peng Gao, Yujian Lee, Zailong Chen, Hui zhang, Xubo Liu, Yiyang Hu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) seeks to find a target image using a multi-modal query, which combines an image with modification text to pinpoint the target. While recent CIR methods have shown promise, they mainly focus on exploring relationships between the query pairs (image and text) through data augmentation or model design. These methods often assume perfect alignment between queries and target images, an idealized scenario rarely encountered in practice. In reality, pairs are often partially or completely mismatched due to issues like inaccurate modification texts, low-quality target images, and annotation errors. Ignoring these mismatches leads to numerous False Positive Pair (FFPs) denoted as noise pairs in the dataset, causing the model to overfit and ultimately reducing its performance. To address this problem, we propose the Noise-aware Contrastive Learning for CIR (NCL-CIR), comprising two key components: the Weight Compensation Block (WCB) and the Noise-pair Filter Block (NFB). The WCB coupled with diverse weight maps can ensure more stable token representations of multi-modal queries and target images. Meanwhile, the NFB, in conjunction with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) predicts noise pairs by evaluating loss distributions, and generates soft labels correspondingly, allowing for the design of the soft-label based Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss function. Consequently, the overall architecture helps to mitigate the influence of mismatched and partially matched samples, with experimental results demonstrating that NCL-CIR achieves exceptional performance on the benchmark datasets.

  _Zhisheng Huang, Peng Wang, Jingdong Zhang, Yuan Liu, Xin Li, Wenping Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized neural rendering with its efficiency and quality, but like many novel view synthesis methods, it heavily depends on accurate camera poses from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) systems. Although recent SfM pipelines have made impressive progress, questions remain about how to further improve both their robust performance in challenging conditions (e.g., textureless scenes) and the precision of camera parameter estimation simultaneously. We present 3R-GS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges this gap by jointly optimizing 3D Gaussians and camera parameters from large reconstruction priors MASt3R-SfM. We note that naively performing joint 3D Gaussian and camera optimization faces two challenges: the sensitivity to the quality of SfM initialization, and its limited capacity for global optimization, leading to suboptimal reconstruction results. Our 3R-GS, overcomes these issues by incorporating optimized practices, enabling robust scene reconstruction even with imperfect camera registration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3R-GS delivers high-quality novel view synthesis and precise camera pose estimation while remaining computationally efficient. Project page:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently marked a significant advancement in 3D reconstruction, delivering both rapid rendering and high-quality results. However, existing 3DGS methods pose challenges in understanding underlying 3D semantics, which hinders model controllability and interpretability. To address it, we propose an interpretable single-view 3DGS framework, termed 3DisGS, to discover both coarse- and fine-grained 3D semantics via hierarchical disentangled representation learning (DRL). Specifically, the model employs a dual-branch architecture, consisting of a point cloud initialization branch and a triplane-Gaussian generation branch, to achieve coarse-grained disentanglement by separating 3D geometry and visual appearance features. Subsequently, fine-grained semantic representations within each modality are further discovered through DRL-based encoder-adapters. To our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve unsupervised interpretable 3DGS. Evaluations indicate that our model achieves 3D disentanglement while preserving high-quality and rapid reconstruction.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating visual information, yet they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, especially when processing noisy or corrupted images. Although existing VLMs adopt security measures during training to mitigate such attacks, vulnerabilities associated with noise-augmented visual inputs are overlooked. In this work, we identify that missing noise-augmented training causes critical security gaps: many VLMs are susceptible to even simple perturbations such as Gaussian noise. To address this challenge, we propose Robust-VLGuard, a multimodal safety dataset with aligned / misaligned image-text pairs, combined with noise-augmented fine-tuning that reduces attack success rates while preserving functionality of VLM. For stronger optimization-based visual perturbation attacks, we propose DiffPure-VLM, leveraging diffusion models to convert adversarial perturbations into Gaussian-like noise, which can be defended by VLMs with noise-augmented safety fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the distribution-shifting property of diffusion model aligns well with our fine-tuned VLMs, significantly mitigating adversarial perturbations across varying intensities. The dataset and code are available atthis https URL.

  _Ben Kaye, Tomas Jakab, Shangzhe Wu, Christian Rupprecht, Andrea Vedaldi_

  The choice of data representation is a key factor in the success of deep learning in geometric tasks. For instance, DUSt3R recently introduced the concept of viewpoint-invariant point maps, generalizing depth prediction and showing that all key problems in the 3D reconstruction of static scenes can be reduced to predicting such point maps. In this paper, we develop an analogous concept for a very different problem: the reconstruction of the 3D shape and pose of deformable objects. To this end, we introduce Dual Point Maps (DualPM), where a pair of point maps is extracted from the same image-one associating pixels to their 3D locations on the object and the other to a canonical version of the object in its rest pose. We also extend point maps to amodal reconstruction to recover the complete shape of the object, even through self-occlusions. We show that 3D reconstruction and 3D pose estimation can be reduced to the prediction of DualPMs. Empirically, we demonstrate that this representation is a suitable target for deep networks to predict. Specifically, we focus on modeling quadrupeds, showing that DualPMs can be trained purely on synthetic 3D data, consisting of one or two models per category, while generalizing effectively to real images.

  We propose SelfSplat, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting model designed to perform pose-free and 3D prior-free generalizable 3D reconstruction from unposed multi-view images. These settings are inherently ill-posed due to the lack of ground-truth data, learned geometric information, and the need to achieve accurate 3D reconstruction without finetuning, making it difficult for conventional methods to achieve high-quality results. Our model addresses these challenges by effectively integrating explicit 3D representations with self-supervised depth and pose estimation techniques, resulting in reciprocal improvements in both pose accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a matching-aware pose estimation network and a depth refinement module to enhance geometry consistency across views, ensuring more accurate and stable 3D reconstructions. To present the performance of our method, we evaluated it on large-scale real-world datasets, including RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. SelfSplat achieves superior results over previous state-of-the-art methods in both appearance and geometry quality, also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization capabilities. Extensive ablation studies and analysis also validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Code and pretrained models are available atthis https URL

  While Signed Distance Fields (SDF) are well-established for modeling watertight surfaces, Unsigned Distance Fields (UDF) broaden the scope to include open surfaces and models with complex inner structures. Despite their flexibility, UDFs encounter significant challenges in high-fidelity 3D reconstruction, such as non-differentiability at the zero level set, difficulty in achieving the exact zero value, numerous local minima, vanishing gradients, and oscillating gradient directions near the zero level set. To address these challenges, we propose Details Enhanced UDF (DEUDF) learning that integrates normal alignment and the SIREN network for capturing fine geometric details, adaptively weighted Eikonal constraints to address vanishing gradients near the target surface, unconditioned MLP-based UDF representation to relax non-negativity constraints, and DCUDF for extracting the local minimal average distance surface. These strategies collectively stabilize the learning process from unoriented point clouds and enhance the accuracy of UDFs. Our computational results demonstrate that DEUDF outperforms existing UDF learning methods in both accuracy and the quality of reconstructed surfaces. Our source code is atthis https URL.

  Feature pyramids have been widely adopted in convolutional neural networks and transformers for tasks in medical image segmentation. However, existing models generally focus on the Encoder-side Transformer for feature extraction. We further explore the potential in improving the feature decoder with a well-designed architecture. We propose Cross Feature Pyramid Transformer decoder (CFPFormer), a novel decoder block that integrates feature pyramids and transformers. Even though transformer-like architecture impress with outstanding performance in segmentation, the concerns to reduce the redundancy and training costs still exist. Specifically, by leveraging patch embedding, cross-layer feature concatenation mechanisms, CFPFormer enhances feature extraction capabilities while complexity issue is mitigated by our Gaussian Attention. Benefiting from Transformer structure and U-shaped connections, our work is capable of capturing long-range dependencies and effectively up-sample feature maps. Experimental results are provided to evaluate CFPFormer on medical image segmentation datasets, demonstrating the efficacy and effectiveness. With a ResNet50 backbone, our method achieves 92.02\% Dice Score, highlighting the efficacy of our methods. Notably, our VGG-based model outperformed baselines with more complex ViT and Swin Transformer backbone.

  Diffusion-Based Purification (DBP) has emerged as an effective defense mechanism against adversarial attacks. The success of DBP is often attributed to the forward diffusion process, which reduces the distribution gap between clean and adversarial images by adding Gaussian noise. While this explanation is theoretically sound, the exact role of this mechanism in enhancing robustness remains unclear. In this paper, through empirical analysis, we propose that the intrinsic stochasticity in the DBP process is the primary factor driving robustness. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a novel Deterministic White-Box (DW-box) setting to assess robustness in the absence of stochasticity, and we analyze attack trajectories and loss landscapes. Our results suggest that DBP models primarily rely on stochasticity to avoid effective attack directions, while their ability to purify adversarial perturbations may be limited. To further enhance the robustness of DBP models, we propose Adversarial Denoising Diffusion Training (ADDT), which incorporates classifier-guided adversarial perturbations into the diffusion training process, thereby strengthening the models' ability to purify adversarial perturbations. Additionally, we propose Rank-Based Gaussian Mapping (RBGM) to improve the compatibility of perturbations with diffusion models. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of ADDT. In conclusion, our study suggests that future research on DBP can benefit from a clearer distinction between stochasticity-driven and purification-driven robustness.
