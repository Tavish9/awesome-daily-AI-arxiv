- **[DATR: Diffusion-based 3D Apple Tree Reconstruction Framework with Sparse-View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19508)**  `arXiv:2508.19508`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  Digital twin applications offered transformative potential by enabling real-time monitoring and robotic simulation through accurate virtual replicas of physical assets. The key to these systems is 3D reconstruction with high geometrical fidelity. However, existing methods struggled under field conditions, especially with sparse and occluded views. This study developed a two-stage framework (DATR) for the reconstruction of apple trees from sparse views. The first stage leverages onboard sensors and foundation models to semi-automatically generate tree masks from complex field images. Tree masks are used to filter out background information in multi-modal data for the single-image-to-3D reconstruction at the second stage. This stage consists of a diffusion model and a large reconstruction model for respective multi view and implicit neural field generation. The training of the diffusion model and LRM was achieved by using realistic synthetic apple trees generated by a Real2Sim data generator. The framework was evaluated on both field and synthetic datasets. The field dataset includes six apple trees with field-measured ground truth, while the synthetic dataset featured structurally diverse trees. Evaluation results showed that our DATR framework outperformed existing 3D reconstruction methods across both datasets and achieved domain-trait estimation comparable to industrial-grade stationary laser scanners while improving the throughput by $\sim$360 times, demonstrating strong potential for scalable agricultural digital twin systems.

  Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical limitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns and a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face insufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while being efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook compounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel paradigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real datasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic observations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by generating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and speed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations that best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based weighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of causal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential interactive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated with closed-loop simulations ($R^2=0.8$) than the best existing open-loop approach ($R^2=0.7$). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Staircase Recognition and Location Based on Polarization Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19026)**  `arXiv:2505.19026`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Staircase is one of the most common structures in artificial scenes. However, it is difficult for humanoid robots and people with lower limb disabilities or visual impairment to cross the scene without the help of sensors and intelligent algorithms. Staircase scene perception technology is a prerequisite for recognition and localization. This technology is of great significance for the mode switching of the robot and the calculation of the footprint position to adapt to the discontinuous terrain. However, there are still many problems that constrain the application of this technology, such as low recognition accuracy, high initial noise from sensors, unstable output signals and high computational requirements. In terms of scene reconstruction, the binocular and time of flight (TOF) reconstruction of the scene can be easily affected by environmental light and the surface material of the target object. In contrast, due to the special structure of the polarizer, the polarization can selectively transmit polarized light in a specific direction and this reconstruction method relies on the polarization information of the object surface. So the advantages of polarization reconstruction are reflected, which are less affected by environmental light and not dependent on the texture information of the object surface. In this paper, in order to achieve the detection of staircase, this paper proposes a contrast enhancement algorithm that integrates polarization and light intensity information, and integrates point cloud segmentation based on YOLOv11. To realize the high-quality reconstruction, we proposed a method of fusing polarized binocular and TOF depth information to realize the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the staircase. Besides, it also proposes a joint calibration algorithm of monocular camera and TOF camera based on ICP registration and improved gray wolf optimization algorithm.

- **[Physics-Informed DeepONet Coupled with FEM for Convective Transport in Porous Media with Sharp Gaussian Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19847)**  `arXiv:2508.19847`  `cs.LG`  
  _Erdi Kara, Panos Stinis_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a hybrid framework that couples finite element methods (FEM) with physics-informed DeepONet to model fluid transport in porous media from sharp, localized Gaussian sources. The governing system consists of a steady-state Darcy flow equation and a time-dependent convection-diffusion equation. Our approach solves the Darcy system using FEM and transfers the resulting velocity field to a physics-informed DeepONet, which learns the mapping from source functions to solute concentration profiles. This modular strategy preserves FEM-level accuracy in the flow field while enabling fast inference for transport dynamics. To handle steep gradients induced by sharp sources, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy for trunk collocation points. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method is in good agreement with the reference solutions while offering orders of magnitude speedups over traditional solvers, making it suitable for practical applications in relevant scenarios. Implementation of our proposed method is available atthis https URL.

- **[Counterfactual Reward Model Training for Bias Mitigation in Multimodal Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19567)**  `arXiv:2508.19567`  `cs.LG`  
  _Sheryl Mathew, N Harshit_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), reward models can efficiently learn and amplify latent biases within multimodal datasets, which can lead to imperfect policy optimization through flawed reward signals and decreased fairness. Bias mitigation studies have often applied passive constraints, which can fail under causal confounding. Here, we present a counterfactual reward model that introduces causal inference with multimodal representation learning to provide an unsupervised, bias-resilient reward signal. The heart of our contribution is the Counterfactual Trust Score, an aggregated score consisting of four components: (1) counterfactual shifts that decompose political framing bias from topical bias; (2) reconstruction uncertainty during counterfactual perturbations; (3) demonstrable violations of fairness rules for each protected attribute; and (4) temporal reward shifts aligned with dynamic trust measures. We evaluated the framework on a multimodal fake versus true news dataset, which exhibits framing bias, class imbalance, and distributional drift. Following methodologies similar to unsupervised drift detection from representation-based distances [1] and temporal robustness benchmarking in language models [2], we also inject synthetic bias across sequential batches to test robustness. The resulting system achieved an accuracy of 89.12% in fake news detection, outperforming the baseline reward models. More importantly, it reduced spurious correlations and unfair reinforcement signals. This pipeline outlines a robust and interpretable approach to fairness-aware RLHF, offering tunable bias reduction thresholds and increasing reliability in dynamic real-time policy making.

- **[MAPo : Motion-Aware Partitioning of Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting for High-Fidelity Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19786)**  `arXiv:2508.19786`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting, known for enabling high-quality static scene reconstruction with fast rendering, is increasingly being applied to dynamic scene reconstruction. A common strategy involves learning a deformation field to model the temporal changes of a canonical set of 3D Gaussians. However, these deformation-based methods often produce blurred renderings and lose fine motion details in highly dynamic regions due to the inherent limitations of a single, unified model in representing diverse motion patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Motion-Aware Partitioning of Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (MAPo), a novel framework for high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction. Its core is a dynamic score-based partitioning strategy that distinguishes between high- and low-dynamic 3D Gaussians. For high-dynamic 3D Gaussians, we recursively partition them temporally and duplicate their deformation networks for each new temporal segment, enabling specialized modeling to capture intricate motion details. Concurrently, low-dynamic 3DGs are treated as static to reduce computational costs. However, this temporal partitioning strategy for high-dynamic 3DGs can introduce visual discontinuities across frames at the partition boundaries. To address this, we introduce a cross-frame consistency loss, which not only ensures visual continuity but also further enhances rendering quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAPo achieves superior rendering quality compared to baselines while maintaining comparable computational costs, particularly in regions with complex or rapid motions.

- **[FastAvatar: Towards Unified Fast High-Fidelity 3D Avatar Reconstruction with Large Gaussian Reconstruction Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19754)**  `arXiv:2508.19754`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite significant progress in 3D avatar reconstruction, it still faces challenges such as high time complexity, sensitivity to data quality, and low data utilization. We propose FastAvatar, a feedforward 3D avatar framework capable of flexibly leveraging diverse daily recordings (e.g., a single image, multi-view observations, or monocular video) to reconstruct a high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model within seconds, using only a single unified model. FastAvatar's core is a Large Gaussian Reconstruction Transformer featuring three key designs: First, a variant VGGT-style transformer architecture aggregating multi-frame cues while injecting initial 3D prompt to predict an aggregatable canonical 3DGS representation; Second, multi-granular guidance encoding (camera pose, FLAME expression, head pose) mitigating animation-induced misalignment for variable-length inputs; Third, incremental Gaussian aggregation via landmark tracking and sliced fusion losses. Integrating these features, FastAvatar enables incremental reconstruction, i.e., improving quality with more observations, unlike prior work wasting input data. This yields a quality-speed-tunable paradigm for highly usable avatar modeling. Extensive experiments show that FastAvatar has higher quality and highly competitive speed compared to existing methods.

- **[IDF: Iterative Dynamic Filtering Networks for Generalizable Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19649)**  `arXiv:2508.19649`  `cs.CV`  
  _Dongjin Kim, Jaekyun Ko, Muhammad Kashif Ali, Tae Hyun Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image denoising is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with applications in photography and medical imaging. While deep learning-based methods have shown remarkable success, their reliance on specific noise distributions limits generalization to unseen noise types and levels. Existing approaches attempt to address this with extensive training data and high computational resources but they still suffer from overfitting. To address these issues, we conduct image denoising by utilizing dynamically generated kernels via efficient operations. This approach helps prevent overfitting and improves resilience to unseen noise. Specifically, our method leverages a Feature Extraction Module for robust noise-invariant features, Global Statistics and Local Correlation Modules to capture comprehensive noise characteristics and structural correlations. The Kernel Prediction Module then employs these cues to produce pixel-wise varying kernels adapted to local structures, which are then applied iteratively for denoising. This ensures both efficiency and superior restoration quality. Despite being trained on single-level Gaussian noise, our compact model (~ 0.04 M) excels across diverse noise types and levels, demonstrating the promise of iterative dynamic filtering for practical image denoising.

- **[High-Speed FHD Full-Color Video Computer-Generated Holography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19579)**  `arXiv:2508.19579`  `cs.CV`  
  _Haomiao Zhang, Miao Cao, Xuan Yu, Hui Luo, Yanling Piao, Mengjie Qin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computer-generated holography (CGH) is a promising technology for next-generation displays. However, generating high-speed, high-quality holographic video requires both high frame rate display and efficient computation, but is constrained by two key limitations: ($i$) Learning-based models often produce over-smoothed phases with narrow angular spectra, causing severe color crosstalk in high frame rate full-color displays such as depth-division multiplexing and thus resulting in a trade-off between frame rate and color fidelity. ($ii$) Existing frame-by-frame optimization methods typically optimize frames independently, neglecting spatial-temporal correlations between consecutive frames and leading to computationally inefficient solutions. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel high-speed full-color video CGH generation scheme. First, we introduce Spectrum-Guided Depth Division Multiplexing (SGDDM), which optimizes phase distributions via frequency modulation, enabling high-fidelity full-color display at high frame rates. Second, we present HoloMamba, a lightweight asymmetric Mamba-Unet architecture that explicitly models spatial-temporal correlations across video sequences to enhance reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate that SGDDM achieves high-fidelity full-color display without compromise in frame rate, while HoloMamba generates FHD (1080p) full-color holographic video at over 260 FPS, more than 2.6$\times$ faster than the prior state-of-the-art Divide-Conquer-and-Merge Strategy.

- **[DNP-Guided Contrastive Reconstruction with a Reverse Distillation Transformer for Medical Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19573)**  `arXiv:2508.19573`  `cs.CV`  
  _Luhu Li, Bowen Lin, Mukhtiar Khan, Shujun Fu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly detection in medical images is challenging due to limited annotations and a domain gap compared to natural images. Existing reconstruction methods often rely on frozen pre-trained encoders, which limits adaptation to domain-specific features and reduces localization accuracy. Prototype-based learning offers interpretability and clustering benefits but suffers from prototype collapse, where few prototypes dominate training, harming diversity and generalization. To address this, we propose a unified framework combining a trainable encoder with prototype-guided reconstruction and a novel Diversity-Aware Alignment Loss. The trainable encoder, enhanced by a momentum branch, enables stable domain-adaptive feature learning. A lightweight Prototype Extractor mines informative normal prototypes to guide the decoder via attention for precise reconstruction. Our loss enforces balanced prototype use through diversity constraints and per-prototype normalization, effectively preventing collapse. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show significant improvements in representation quality and anomaly localization, outperforming prior methods. Visualizations and prototype assignment analyses further validate the effectiveness of our anti-collapse mechanism and enhanced interpretability.

- **[MonoRelief V2: Leveraging Real Data for High-Fidelity Monocular Relief Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19555)**  `arXiv:2508.19555`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yu-Wei Zhang, Tongju Han, Lipeng Gao, Mingqiang Wei, Hui Liu, Changbao Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents MonoRelief V2, an end-to-end model designed for directly recovering 2.5D reliefs from single images under complex material and illumination variations. In contrast to its predecessor, MonoRelief V1 [1], which was solely trained on synthetic data, MonoRelief V2 incorporates real data to achieve improved robustness, accuracy and efficiency. To overcome the challenge of acquiring large-scale real-world dataset, we generate approximately 15,000 pseudo real images using a text-to-image generative model, and derive corresponding depth pseudo-labels through fusion of depth and normal predictions. Furthermore, we construct a small-scale real-world dataset (800 samples) via multi-view reconstruction and detail refinement. MonoRelief V2 is then progressively trained on the pseudo-real and real-world datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance both in depth and normal predictions, highlighting its strong potential for a range of downstream applications.
