  Learning from demonstration is a promising approach for teaching robots new skills. However, a central challenge in the execution of acquired skills is the ability to recognize faults and prevent failures. This is essential because demonstrations typically cover only a limited set of scenarios and often only the successful ones. During task execution, unforeseen situations may arise, such as changes in the robot's environment or interaction with human operators. To recognize such situations, this paper focuses on teaching the robot situational awareness by using a camera input and labeling frames as safe or risky. We train a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model fed by a low-dimensional latent space representation of the input images. The model outputs a continuous risk score ranging from zero to one, quantifying the degree of risk at each timestep. This allows for pausing task execution in unsafe situations and directly adding new training data, labeled by the human user. Our experiments on a robotic manipulator show that the proposed method can reliably detect both known and novel faults using only a single example for each new fault. In contrast, a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) performs well only on faults it has encountered during training. Our method enables the next generation of cobots to be rapidly deployed with easy-to-set-up, vision-based risk assessment, proactively safeguarding humans and detecting misaligned parts or missing objects before failures occur. We provide all the code and data required to reproduce our experiments atthis http URL.

  Achieving efficient remote teleoperation is particularly challenging in unknown environments, as the teleoperator must rapidly build an understanding of the site's layout. Online 3D mapping is a proven strategy to tackle this challenge, as it enables the teleoperator to progressively explore the site from multiple perspectives. However, traditional online map-based teleoperation systems struggle to generate visually accurate 3D maps in real-time due to the high computational cost involved, leading to poor teleoperation performances. In this work, we propose a solution to improve teleoperation efficiency in unknown environments. Our approach proposes a novel, modular and efficient GPU-based integration between recent advancement in gaussian splatting SLAM and existing online map-based teleoperation systems. We compare the proposed solution against state-of-the-art teleoperation systems and validate its performances through real-world experiments using an aerial vehicle. The results show significant improvements in decision-making speed and more accurate interaction with the environment, leading to greater teleoperation efficiency. In doing so, our system enhances remote teleoperation by seamlessly integrating photorealistic mapping generation with real-time performances, enabling effective teleoperation in unfamiliar environments.

- **[Evaluating the Efficiency of Latent Spaces via the Coupling-Matrix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06314)**  `arXiv:2509.06314`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`

  A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact, interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality. We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse. Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C) can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.

- **[QualityFM: a Multimodal Physiological Signal Foundation Model with Self-Distillation for Signal Quality Challenges in Critically Ill Patients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06516)**  `arXiv:2509.06516`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Zongheng Guo, Tao Chen, Manuela Ferrario_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly recorded in intesive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR). However, the high incidence of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality, leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function, which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models with varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy and practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks: false alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial fibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and ECG signals.

- **[Predicting Fetal Outcomes from Cardiotocography Signals Using a Supervised Variational Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06540)**  `arXiv:2509.06540`  `cs.LG`

  Objective: To develop and interpret a supervised variational autoencoder (VAE) model for classifying cardiotocography (CTG) signals based on pregnancy outcomes, addressing interpretability limits of current deep learning approaches. Methods: The OxMat CTG dataset was used to train a VAE on five-minute fetal heart rate (FHR) segments, labeled with postnatal outcomes. The model was optimised for signal reconstruction and outcome prediction, incorporating Kullback-Leibler divergence and total correlation (TC) constraints to structure the latent space. Performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and mean squared error (MSE). Interpretability was assessed using coefficient of determination, latent traversals and unsupervised component analyses. Results: The model achieved an AUROC of 0.752 at the segment level and 0.779 at the CTG level, where predicted scores were aggregated. Relaxing TC constraints improved both reconstruction and classification. Latent analysis showed that baseline-related features (e.g., FHR baseline, baseline shift) were well represented and aligned with model scores, while metrics like short- and long-term variability were less strongly encoded. Traversals revealed clear signal changes for baseline features, while other properties were entangled or subtle. Unsupervised decompositions corroborated these patterns. Findings: This work demonstrates that supervised VAEs can achieve competitive fetal outcome prediction while partially encoding clinically meaningful CTG features. The irregular, multi-timescale nature of FHR signals poses challenges for disentangling physiological components, distinguishing CTG from more periodic signals such as ECG. Although full interpretability was not achieved, the model supports clinically useful outcome prediction and provides a basis for future interpretable, generative models.

  _Manit Baser, Dinil Mon Divakaran, Mohan Gurusamy_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robust model-editing techniques are essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in practical applications, to enable cost-effective ways to deal with challenges such as privacy breaches, bias mitigation and misinformation spread. For example, an LLM-based healthcare assistance may need to update out-dated or incorrect knowledge to prevent harmful recommendations. However, many editing techniques focus on isolated facts, which critically fail to prevent indirect knowledge leakage -- the unintended reconstruction of edited-out information through persistent causal links and contextual relationships. To assist users in selecting the right editing technique, we develop and present ThinkEval, a framework to systematically quantify indirect knowledge leakage and ripple effects in model-editing. ThinkEval builds and employs specialized knowledge graphs to analyze the causal structure of facts before and after editing. To support this approach, we present KnowGIC, a benchmark dataset comprising multi-step reasoning paths that precisely measure these complex knowledge transformation effects. We evaluate five editing techniques: AlphaEdit, RECT, ROME, MEMIT, and PRUNE across multiple LLMs. Our results show that these techniques struggle to balance indirect fact suppression with the preservation of related knowledge, compromising the contextual integrity of a model's knowledge. Our dataset is available at:this https URL.

- **[Sampling from Energy-based Policies using Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01312)**  `arXiv:2410.01312`  `cs.LG`  
  _Vineet Jain, Tara Akhound-Sadegh, Siamak Ravanbakhsh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Energy-based policies offer a flexible framework for modeling complex, multimodal behaviors in reinforcement learning (RL). In maximum entropy RL, the optimal policy is a Boltzmann distribution derived from the soft Q-function, but direct sampling from this distribution in continuous action spaces is computationally intractable. As a result, existing methods typically use simpler parametric distributions, like Gaussians, for policy representation -- limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of multimodal action distributions. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based approach for sampling from energy-based policies, where the negative Q-function defines the energy function. Based on this approach, we propose an actor-critic method called Diffusion Q-Sampling (DQS) that enables more expressive policy representations, allowing stable learning in diverse environments. We show that our approach enhances sample efficiency in continuous control tasks and captures multimodal behaviors, addressing key limitations of existing methods. Code is available atthis https URL

  Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue, which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution, low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to $60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in complex natural environments.

- **[FAVAE-Effective Frequency Aware Latent Tokenizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05441)**  `arXiv:2509.05441`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions, due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains rapid adoption in safety-critical tasks for efficient novel-view synthesis from static images, how might an adversary tamper images to cause harm? We introduce ComplicitSplat, the first attack that exploits standard 3DGS shading methods to create viewpoint-specific camouflage - colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed adversarial content in scene objects that are visible only from specific viewpoints and without requiring access to model architecture or weights. Our extensive experiments show that ComplicitSplat generalizes to successfully attack a variety of popular detector - both single-stage, multi-stage, and transformer-based models on both real-world capture of physical objects and synthetic scenes. To our knowledge, this is the first black-box attack on downstream object detectors using 3DGS, exposing a novel safety risk for applications like autonomous navigation and other mission-critical robotic systems.

  _Niels Balemans, Ali Anwar, Jan Steckel, Siegfried Mercelis_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space, with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose different metrics based on the Fr√©chet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance for downstream SLAM.

- **[SpecSwin3D: Generating Hyperspectral Imagery from Multispectral Data via Transformer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06122)**  `arXiv:2509.06122`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Tang Sui, Songxi Yang, Qunying Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity. Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40¬∞, and SSIM of 0.96, outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification and burnt area segmentation.

- **[Comparative Evaluation of Hard and Soft Clustering for Precise Brain Tumor Segmentation in MR Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05340)**  `arXiv:2509.05340`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association. Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset, incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of 0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

- **[Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector for Image Forgery Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12341)**  `arXiv:2508.12341`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Ziye Wang, Minghang Yu, Chunyan Xu, Zhen Cui_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid advancement of image generation techniques, robust forgery detection has become increasingly imperative to ensure the trustworthiness of digital media. Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of pre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the misalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the model's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction learning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing discrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery feature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies to minimize redundant forgery information. Experiments conducted on two standard image forgery datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SDD, which achieves superior results compared to existing methods. The code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Regeneration Based Training-free Attribution of Fake Images Generated by Text-to-Image Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01489)**  `arXiv:2403.01489`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Meiling Li, Zhenxing Qian, Xinpeng Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image generative models have recently garnered significant attention due to their ability to generate images based on prompt descriptions. While these models have shown promising performance, concerns have been raised regarding the potential misuse of the generated fake images. In response to this, we have presented a simple yet effective training-free method to attribute fake images generated by text-to-image models to their source models. Given a test image to be attributed, we first inverse the textual prompt of the image, and then put the reconstructed prompt into different candidate models to regenerate candidate fake images. By calculating and ranking the similarity of the test image and the candidate images, we can determine the source of the image. This attribution allows model owners to be held accountable for any misuse of their models. Note that our approach does not limit the number of candidate text-to-image generative models. Comprehensive experiments reveal that (1) Our method can effectively attribute fake images to their source models, achieving comparable attribution performance with the state-of-the-art method; (2) Our method has high scalability ability, which is well adapted to real-world attribution scenarios. (3) The proposed method yields satisfactory robustness to common attacks, such as Gaussian blurring, JPEG compression, and Resizing. We also analyze the factors that influence the attribution performance, and explore the boost brought by the proposed method as a plug-in to improve the performance of existing SOTA. We hope our work can shed some light on the solutions to addressing the source of AI-generated images, as well as to prevent the misuse of text-to-image generative models.

- **[Matching Shapes Under Different Topologies: A Topology-Adaptive Deformation Guided Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06862)**  `arXiv:2509.06862`  `cs.CV`  
  _Aymen Merrouche, Stefanie Wuhrer, Edmond Boyer_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D alignment quality.

- **[VIM-GS: Visual-Inertial Monocular Gaussian Splatting via Object-level Guidance in Large Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06685)**  `arXiv:2509.06685`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shengkai Zhang, Yuhe Liu, Guanjun Wu, Jianhua He, Xinggang Wang, Mozi Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes. Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency, inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output, we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

- **[3DOF+Quantization: 3DGS quantization for large scenes with limited Degrees of Freedom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06400)**  `arXiv:2509.06400`  `cs.CV`  
  _Matthieu Gendrin, St√©phane Pateux, Th√©o Ladune_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes, though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as 3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden scene.

- **[Multi-Strategy Guided Diffusion via Sparse Masking Temporal Reweighting Distribution Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05992)**  `arXiv:2509.05992`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zekun Zhou, Yanru Gong, Liu Shi, Qiegen Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information. The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of 2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

  _Jonathan Aellen, Florian Burkhardt, Thomas Vetter, Marcel L√ºthi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions, particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance. It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable in plug-and-play scenarios.

- **[Depth-Aware Super-Resolution via Distance-Adaptive Variational Formulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05746)**  `arXiv:2509.05746`  `cs.CV`  
  _Tianhao Guo, Bingjie Lu, Feng Wang, Zhengyang Lu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges. Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by 0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

  In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

  We introduce a novel, data-driven approach for reconstructing temporally coherent 3D motion from unstructured and potentially partial observations of non-rigidly deforming shapes. Our goal is to achieve high-fidelity motion reconstructions for shapes that undergo near-isometric deformations, such as humans wearing loose clothing. The key novelty of our work lies in its ability to combine implicit shape representations with explicit mesh-based deformation models, enabling detailed and temporally coherent motion reconstructions without relying on parametric shape models or decoupling shape and motion. Each frame is represented as a neural field decoded from a feature space where observations over time are fused, hence preserving geometric details present in the input data. Temporal coherence is enforced with a near-isometric deformation constraint between adjacent frames that applies to the underlying surface in the neural field. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, as demonstrated by its application to human and animal motion sequences reconstructed from monocular depth videos.

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become the de facto method of 3D representation in many vision tasks. This calls for the 3D understanding directly in this representation space. To facilitate the research in this direction, we first build ShapeSplat, a large-scale dataset of 3DGS using the commonly used ShapeNet, ModelNet and Objaverse datasets. Our dataset ShapeSplat consists of 206K objects spanning over 87 unique categories, whose labels are in accordance with the respective datasets. The creation of this dataset utilized the compute equivalent of 3.8 GPU years on a TITAN XP GPU.We utilize our dataset for unsupervised pretraining and supervised finetuning for classification and segmentation tasks. To this end, we introduce Gaussian-MAE, which highlights the unique benefits of representation learning from Gaussian parameters. Through exhaustive experiments, we provide several valuable insights. In particular, we show that (1) the distribution of the optimized GS centroids significantly differs from the uniformly sampled point cloud (used for initialization) counterpart; (2) this change in distribution results in degradation in classification but improvement in segmentation tasks when using only the centroids; (3) to leverage additional Gaussian parameters, we propose Gaussian feature grouping in a normalized feature space, along with splats pooling layer, offering a tailored solution to effectively group and embed similar Gaussians, which leads to notable improvement in finetuning tasks.

  The scarcity of high-quality, logically sound data is a critical bottleneck for advancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our work confronts this challenge by turning decades of automated theorem proving research into a scalable data engine. Rather than relying on error-prone LLMs or complex proof-assistant syntax like Lean and Isabelle, our framework leverages E-prover's saturation capabilities on the vast TPTP axiom library to derive a massive, guaranteed-valid corpus of theorems. Our pipeline is principled and simple: saturate axioms, filter for "interesting" theorems, and generate tasks. With no LLMs in the loop, we eliminate factual errors by construction. This purely symbolic data is then transformed into three difficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection, and proof reconstruction. Our zero-shot experiments on frontier models reveal a clear weakness: performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural reasoning. Our framework provides both the diagnostic tool to measure this gap and a scalable source of symbolic training data to address it. We make the code and data publicly available.this https URLthis https URL
