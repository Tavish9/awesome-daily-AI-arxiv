- **[ZeroGrasp: Zero-Shot Shape Reconstruction Enabled Robotic Grasping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10857)**  `arXiv:2504.10857`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  Robotic grasping is a cornerstone capability of embodied systems. Many methods directly output grasps from partial information without modeling the geometry of the scene, leading to suboptimal motion and even collisions. To address these issues, we introduce ZeroGrasp, a novel framework that simultaneously performs 3D reconstruction and grasp pose prediction in near real-time. A key insight of our method is that occlusion reasoning and modeling the spatial relationships between objects is beneficial for both accurate reconstruction and grasping. We couple our method with a novel large-scale synthetic dataset, which comprises 1M photo-realistic images, high-resolution 3D reconstructions and 11.3B physically-valid grasp pose annotations for 12K objects from the Objaverse-LVIS dataset. We evaluate ZeroGrasp on the GraspNet-1B benchmark as well as through real-world robot experiments. ZeroGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes to novel real-world objects by leveraging synthetic data.

- **[A PyTorch-Compatible Spike Encoding Framework for Energy-Efficient Neuromorphic Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11026)**  `arXiv:2504.11026`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer promising energy efficiency advantages, particularly when processing sparse spike trains. However, their incompatibility with traditional datasets, which consist of batches of input vectors rather than spike trains, necessitates the development of efficient encoding methods. This paper introduces a novel, open-source PyTorch-compatible Python framework for spike encoding, designed for neuromorphic applications in machine learning and reinforcement learning. The framework supports a range of encoding algorithms, including Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), Step Forward (SF), Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), and Ben's Spiker Algorithm (BSA), as well as specialized encoding strategies covering population coding and reinforcement learning scenarios. Furthermore, we investigate the performance trade-offs of each method on embedded hardware using C/C++ implementations, considering energy consumption, computation time, spike sparsity, and reconstruction accuracy. Our findings indicate that SF typically achieves the lowest reconstruction error and offers the highest energy efficiency and fastest encoding speed, achieving the second-best spike sparsity. At the same time, other methods demonstrate particular strengths depending on the signal characteristics. This framework and the accompanying empirical analysis provide valuable resources for selecting optimal encoding strategies for energy-efficient SNN applications.

- **[Reward-free World Models for Online Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14081)**  `arXiv:2410.14081`  `cs.LG`  
  _Shangzhe Li, Zhiao Huang, Hao Su_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imitation learning (IL) enables agents to acquire skills directly from expert demonstrations, providing a compelling alternative to reinforcement learning. However, prior online IL approaches struggle with complex tasks characterized by high-dimensional inputs and complex dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel approach to online imitation learning that leverages reward-free world models. Our method learns environmental dynamics entirely in latent spaces without reconstruction, enabling efficient and accurate modeling. We adopt the inverse soft-Q learning objective, reformulating the optimization process in the Q-policy space to mitigate the instability associated with traditional optimization in the reward-policy space. By employing a learned latent dynamics model and planning for control, our approach consistently achieves stable, expert-level performance in tasks with high-dimensional observation or action spaces and intricate dynamics. We evaluate our method on a diverse set of benchmarks, including DMControl, MyoSuite, and ManiSkill2, demonstrating superior empirical performance compared to existing approaches.

- **[A DeepONet for inverting the Neumann-to-Dirichlet Operator in Electrical Impedance Tomography: An approximation theoretic perspective and numerical results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17182)**  `arXiv:2407.17182`  `cs.LG`  
  _Anuj Abhishek, Thilo Strauss_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we consider the non-invasive medical imaging modality of Electrical Impedance Tomography, where the problem is to recover the conductivity in a medium from a set of data that arises out of a current-to-voltage map (Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator) defined on the boundary of the medium. We formulate this inverse problem as an operator-learning problem where the goal is to learn the implicitly defined operator-to-function map between the space of Neumann-to-Dirichlet operators to the space of admissible conductivities. Subsequently, we use an operator-learning architecture, popularly called DeepONets, to learn this operator-to-function map. Thus far, most of the operator learning architectures have been implemented to learn operators between function spaces. In this work, we generalize the earlier works and use a DeepONet to actually {learn an operator-to-function} map. We provide a Universal Approximation Theorem type result which guarantees that this implicitly defined operator-to-function map between the space of Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator to the space of conductivity function can be approximated to an arbitrary degree using such a DeepONet. Furthermore, we provide a computational implementation of our proposed approach and compare it against a standard baseline. We show that the proposed approach achieves good reconstructions and outperforms the baseline method in our experiments.

- **[Recognition of Geometrical Shapes by Dictionary Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10958)**  `arXiv:2504.10958`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Alexander K√∂hler, Michael Breu√ü_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dictionary learning is a versatile method to produce an overcomplete set of vectors, called atoms, to represent a given input with only a few atoms. In the literature, it has been used primarily for tasks that explore its powerful representation capabilities, such as for image reconstruction. In this work, we present a first approach to make dictionary learning work for shape recognition, considering specifically geometrical shapes. As we demonstrate, the choice of the underlying optimization method has a significant impact on recognition quality. Experimental results confirm that dictionary learning may be an interesting method for shape recognition tasks.

- **[Uncertainty Estimation for Trust Attribution to Speed-of-Sound Reconstruction with Variational Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11307)**  `arXiv:2504.11307`  `cs.CV`  
  _Sonia Laguna, Lin Zhang, Can Deniz Bezek, Monika Farkas, Dieter Schweizer, Rahel A. Kubik-Huch, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speed-of-sound (SoS) is a biomechanical characteristic of tissue, and its imaging can provide a promising biomarker for diagnosis. Reconstructing SoS images from ultrasound acquisitions can be cast as a limited-angle computed-tomography problem, with Variational Networks being a promising model-based deep learning solution. Some acquired data frames may, however, get corrupted by noise due to, e.g., motion, lack of contact, and acoustic shadows, which in turn negatively affects the resulting SoS reconstructions. We propose to use the uncertainty in SoS reconstructions to attribute trust to each individual acquired frame. Given multiple acquisitions, we then use an uncertainty based automatic selection among these retrospectively, to improve diagnostic decisions. We investigate uncertainty estimation based on Monte Carlo Dropout and Bayesian Variational Inference. We assess our automatic frame selection method for differential diagnosis of breast cancer, distinguishing between benign fibroadenoma and malignant carcinoma. We evaluate 21 lesions classified as BI-RADS~4, which represents suspicious cases for probable malignancy. The most trustworthy frame among four acquisitions of each lesion was identified using uncertainty based criteria. Selecting a frame informed by uncertainty achieved an area under curve of 76% and 80% for Monte Carlo Dropout and Bayesian Variational Inference, respectively, superior to any uncertainty-uninformed baselines with the best one achieving 64%. A novel use of uncertainty estimation is proposed for selecting one of multiple data acquisitions for further processing and decision making.

- **[3DAffordSplat: Efficient Affordance Reasoning with 3D Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11218)**  `arXiv:2504.11218`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zeming wei, Junyi Lin, Yang Liu, Weixing Chen, Jingzhou Luo, Guanbin Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D affordance reasoning is essential in associating human instructions with the functional regions of 3D objects, facilitating precise, task-oriented manipulations in embodied AI. However, current methods, which predominantly depend on sparse 3D point clouds, exhibit limited generalizability and robustness due to their sensitivity to coordinate variations and the inherent sparsity of the data. By contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers high-fidelity, real-time rendering with minimal computational overhead by representing scenes as dense, continuous distributions. This positions 3DGS as a highly effective approach for capturing fine-grained affordance details and improving recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, its full potential remains largely untapped due to the absence of large-scale, 3DGS-specific affordance datasets. To overcome these limitations, we present 3DAffordSplat, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset tailored for 3DGS-based affordance reasoning. This dataset includes 23,677 Gaussian instances, 8,354 point cloud instances, and 6,631 manually annotated affordance labels, encompassing 21 object categories and 18 affordance types. Building upon this dataset, we introduce AffordSplatNet, a novel model specifically designed for affordance reasoning using 3DGS representations. AffordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal structure alignment module that exploits structural consistency priors to align 3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, resulting in enhanced affordance recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat dataset significantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGS domain, while AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms existing methods across both seen and unseen settings, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities.

- **[Vivid4D: Improving 4D Reconstruction from Monocular Video by Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11092)**  `arXiv:2504.11092`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jiaxin Huang, Sheng Miao, BangBnag Yang, Yuewen Ma, Yiyi Liao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing 4D dynamic scenes from casually captured monocular videos is valuable but highly challenging, as each timestamp is observed from a single viewpoint. We introduce Vivid4D, a novel approach that enhances 4D monocular video synthesis by augmenting observation views - synthesizing multi-view videos from a monocular input. Unlike existing methods that either solely leverage geometric priors for supervision or use generative priors while overlooking geometry, we integrate both. This reformulates view augmentation as a video inpainting task, where observed views are warped into new viewpoints based on monocular depth priors. To achieve this, we train a video inpainting model on unposed web videos with synthetically generated masks that mimic warping occlusions, ensuring spatially and temporally consistent completion of missing regions. To further mitigate inaccuracies in monocular depth priors, we introduce an iterative view augmentation strategy and a robust reconstruction loss. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively improves monocular 4D scene reconstruction and completion.

- **[Leveraging LLMs and attention-mechanism for automatic annotation of historical maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11050)**  `arXiv:2504.11050`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yunshuang Yuan, Monika Sester_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Historical maps are essential resources that provide insights into the geographical landscapes of the past. They serve as valuable tools for researchers across disciplines such as history, geography, and urban studies, facilitating the reconstruction of historical environments and the analysis of spatial transformations over time. However, when constrained to analogue or scanned formats, their interpretation is limited to humans and therefore not scalable. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly in computer vision and large language models (LLMs), have opened new avenues for automating the recognition and classification of features and objects in historical maps. In this paper, we propose a novel distillation method that leverages LLMs and attention mechanisms for the automatic annotation of historical maps. LLMs are employed to generate coarse classification labels for low-resolution historical image patches, while attention mechanisms are utilized to refine these labels to higher resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that the refined labels achieve a high recall of more than 90%. Additionally, the intersection over union (IoU) scores--84.2% for Wood and 72.0% for Settlement--along with precision scores of 87.1% and 79.5%, respectively, indicate that most labels are well-aligned with ground-truth annotations. Notably, these results were achieved without the use of fine-grained manual labels during training, underscoring the potential of our approach for efficient and scalable historical map analysis.

- **[Easy3D: A Simple Yet Effective Method for 3D Interactive Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11024)**  `arXiv:2504.11024`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing availability of digital 3D environments, whether through image-based 3D reconstruction, generation, or scans obtained by robots, is driving innovation across various applications. These come with a significant demand for 3D interaction, such as 3D Interactive Segmentation, which is useful for tasks like object selection and manipulation. Additionally, there is a persistent need for solutions that are efficient, precise, and performing well across diverse settings, particularly in unseen environments and with unfamiliar objects. In this work, we introduce a 3D interactive segmentation method that consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art techniques on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Our simple approach integrates a voxel-based sparse encoder with a lightweight transformer-based decoder that implements implicit click fusion, achieving superior performance and maximizing efficiency. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements on benchmark datasets, including ScanNet, ScanNet++, S3DIS, and KITTI-360, and also on unseen geometric distributions such as the ones obtained by Gaussian Splatting.

- **[DAAF:Degradation-Aware Adaptive Fusion Framework for Robust Infrared and Visible Images Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10871)**  `arXiv:2504.10871`  `cs.CV`  
  _Tianpei Zhang, Jufeng Zhao, Yiming Zhu, Guangmang Cui, Yuxin Jing, Yuhan Lyu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing infrared and visible image fusion(IVIF) algorithms often prioritize high-quality images, neglecting image degradation such as low light and noise, which limits the practical potential. This paper propose Degradation-Aware Adaptive image Fusion (DAAF), which achieves unified modeling of adaptive degradation optimization and image fusion. Specifically, DAAF comprises an auxiliary Adaptive Degradation Optimization Network (ADON) and a Feature Interactive Local-Global Fusion (FILGF) Network. Firstly, ADON includes infrared and visible-light branches. Within the infrared branch, frequency-domain feature decomposition and extraction are employed to isolate Gaussian and stripe noise. In the visible-light branch, Retinex decomposition is applied to extract illumination and reflectance components, enabling complementary enhancement of detail and illumination distribution. Subsequently, FILGF performs interactive multi-scale local-global feature fusion. Local feature fusion consists of intra-inter model feature complement, while global feature fusion is achieved through a interactive cross-model attention. Extensive experiments have shown that DAAF outperforms current IVIF algorithms in normal and complex degradation scenarios.

- **[GaSLight: Gaussian Splats for Spatially-Varying Lighting in HDR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10809)**  `arXiv:2504.10809`  `cs.CV`  
  _Christophe Bolduc, Yannick Hold-Geoffroy, Zhixin Shu, Jean-Fran√ßois Lalonde_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present GaSLight, a method that generates spatially-varying lighting from regular images. Our method proposes using HDR Gaussian Splats as light source representation, marking the first time regular images can serve as light sources in a 3D renderer. Our two-stage process first enhances the dynamic range of images plausibly and accurately by leveraging the priors embedded in diffusion models. Next, we employ Gaussian Splats to model 3D lighting, achieving spatially variant lighting. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results on HDR estimations and their applications in illuminating virtual objects and scenes. To facilitate the benchmarking of images as light sources, we introduce a novel dataset of calibrated and unsaturated HDR to evaluate images as light sources. We assess our method using a combination of this novel dataset and an existing dataset from the literature. The code to reproduce our method will be available upon acceptance.

- **[LL-Gaussian: Low-Light Scene Reconstruction and Enhancement via Gaussian Splatting for Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10331)**  `arXiv:2504.10331`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hao Sun, Fenggen Yu, Huiyao Xu, Tao Zhang, Changqing Zou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Novel view synthesis (NVS) in low-light scenes remains a significant challenge due to degraded inputs characterized by severe noise, low dynamic range (LDR) and unreliable initialization. While recent NeRF-based approaches have shown promising results, most suffer from high computational costs, and some rely on carefully captured or pre-processed data--such as RAW sensor inputs or multi-exposure sequences--which severely limits their practicality. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with competitive visual fidelity; however, existing 3DGS-based methods struggle with low-light sRGB inputs, resulting in unstable Gaussian initialization and ineffective noise suppression. To address these challenges, we propose LL-Gaussian, a novel framework for 3D reconstruction and enhancement from low-light sRGB images, enabling pseudo normal-light novel view synthesis. Our method introduces three key innovations: 1) an end-to-end Low-Light Gaussian Initialization Module (LLGIM) that leverages dense priors from learning-based MVS approach to generate high-quality initial point clouds; 2) a dual-branch Gaussian decomposition model that disentangles intrinsic scene properties (reflectance and illumination) from transient interference, enabling stable and interpretable optimization; 3) an unsupervised optimization strategy guided by both physical constrains and diffusion prior to jointly steer decomposition and enhancement. Additionally, we contribute a challenging dataset collected in extreme low-light environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of LL-Gaussian. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, LL-Gaussian achieves up to 2,000 times faster inference and reduces training time to just 2%, while delivering superior reconstruction and rendering quality.

- **[GaussVideoDreamer: 3D Scene Generation with Video Diffusion and Inconsistency-Aware Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10001)**  `arXiv:2504.10001`  `cs.CV`  
  _Junlin Hao, Peiheng Wang, Haoyang Wang, Xinggong Zhang, Zongming Guo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Single-image 3D scene reconstruction presents significant challenges due to its inherently ill-posed nature and limited input constraints. Recent advances have explored two promising directions: multiview generative models that train on 3D consistent datasets but struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, and 3D scene inpainting and completion frameworks that suffer from cross-view inconsistency and suboptimal error handling, as they depend exclusively on depth data or 3D smoothness, which ultimately degrades output quality and computational performance. Building upon these approaches, we present GaussVideoDreamer, which advances generative multimedia approaches by bridging the gap between image, video, and 3D generation, integrating their strengths through two key innovations: (1) A progressive video inpainting strategy that harnesses temporal coherence for improved multiview consistency and faster convergence. (2) A 3D Gaussian Splatting consistency mask to guide the video diffusion with 3D consistent multiview evidence. Our pipeline combines three core components: a geometry-aware initialization protocol, Inconsistency-Aware Gaussian Splatting, and a progressive video inpainting strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves 32% higher LLaVA-IQA scores and at least 2x speedup compared to existing methods while maintaining robust performance across diverse scenes.

- **[BlockGaussian: Efficient Large-Scale Scene Novel View Synthesis via Adaptive Block-Based Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09048)**  `arXiv:2504.09048`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yongchang Wu, Zipeng Qi, Zhenwei Shi, Zhengxia Zou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable potential in novel view synthesis tasks. The divide-and-conquer paradigm has enabled large-scale scene reconstruction, but significant challenges remain in scene partitioning, optimization, and merging processes. This paper introduces BlockGaussian, a novel framework incorporating a content-aware scene partition strategy and visibility-aware block optimization to achieve efficient and high-quality large-scale scene reconstruction. Specifically, our approach considers the content-complexity variation across different regions and balances computational load during scene partitioning, enabling efficient scene reconstruction. To tackle the supervision mismatch issue during independent block optimization, we introduce auxiliary points during individual block optimization to align the ground-truth supervision, which enhances the reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-view geometry constraint that effectively mitigates rendering degradation caused by airspace floaters during block merging. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction efficiency and rendering quality, with a 5x speedup in optimization and an average PSNR improvement of 1.21 dB on multiple benchmarks. Notably, BlockGaussian significantly reduces computational requirements, enabling large-scale scene reconstruction on a single 24GB VRAM device. The project page is available atthis https URL

- **[SC-NeRF: NeRF-based Point Cloud Reconstruction using a Stationary Camera for Agricultural Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21958)**  `arXiv:2503.21958`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kibon Ku, Talukder Z Jubery, Elijah Rodriguez, Aditya Balu, Soumik Sarkar, Adarsh Krishnamurthy, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a NeRF-based framework for point cloud (PCD) reconstruction, specifically designed for indoor high-throughput plant phenotyping facilities. Traditional NeRF-based reconstruction methods require cameras to move around stationary objects, but this approach is impractical for high-throughput environments where objects are rapidly imaged while moving on conveyors or rotating pedestals. To address this limitation, we develop a variant of NeRF-based PCD reconstruction that uses a single stationary camera to capture images as the object rotates on a pedestal. Our workflow comprises COLMAP-based pose estimation, a straightforward pose transformation to simulate camera movement, and subsequent standard NeRF training. A defined Region of Interest (ROI) excludes irrelevant scene data, enabling the generation of high-resolution point clouds (10M points). Experimental results demonstrate excellent reconstruction fidelity, with precision-recall analyses yielding an F-score close to 100.00 across all evaluated plant objects. Although pose estimation remains computationally intensive with a stationary camera setup, overall training and reconstruction times are competitive, validating the method's feasibility for practical high-throughput indoor phenotyping applications. Our findings indicate that high-quality NeRF-based 3D reconstructions are achievable using a stationary camera, eliminating the need for complex camera motion or costly imaging equipment. This approach is especially beneficial when employing expensive and delicate instruments, such as hyperspectral cameras, for 3D plant phenotyping. Future work will focus on optimizing pose estimation techniques and further streamlining the methodology to facilitate seamless integration into automated, high-throughput 3D phenotyping pipelines.

  _Haijie Li, Yanmin Wu, Jiarui Meng, Qiankun Gao, Zhiyao Zhang, Ronggang Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D scene understanding has become an essential area of research with applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful approach, combining explicit modeling with neural adaptability to provide efficient and detailed scene representations. However, three major challenges remain in leveraging 3DGS for scene understanding: 1) an imbalance between appearance and semantics, where dense Gaussian usage for fine-grained texture modeling does not align with the minimal requirements for semantic attributes; 2) inconsistencies between appearance and semantics, as purely appearance-based Gaussians often misrepresent object boundaries; and 3) reliance on top-down instance segmentation methods, which struggle with uneven category distributions, leading to over- or under-segmentation. In this work, we propose InstanceGaussian, a method that jointly learns appearance and semantic features while adaptively aggregating instances. Our contributions include: i) a novel Semantic-Scaffold-GS representation balancing appearance and semantics to improve feature representations and boundary delineation; ii) a progressive appearance-semantic joint training strategy to enhance stability and segmentation accuracy; and iii) a bottom-up, category-agnostic instance aggregation approach that addresses segmentation challenges through farthest point sampling and connected component analysis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in category-agnostic, open-vocabulary 3D point-level segmentation, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed representation and training strategies.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Constructing vivid 3D head avatars for given subjects and realizing a series of animations on them is valuable yet challenging. This paper presents GaussianHead, which models the actional human head with anisotropic 3D Gaussians. In our framework, a motion deformation field and multi-resolution tri-plane are constructed respectively to deal with the head's dynamic geometry and complex texture. Notably, we impose an exclusive derivation scheme on each Gaussian, which generates its multiple doppelgangers through a set of learnable parameters for position transformation. With this design, we can compactly and accurately encode the appearance information of Gaussians, even those fitting the head's particular components with sophisticated structures. In addition, an inherited derivation strategy for newly added Gaussians is adopted to facilitate training acceleration. Extensive experiments show that our method can produce high-fidelity renderings, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction, cross-identity reenactment, and novel view synthesis tasks.
