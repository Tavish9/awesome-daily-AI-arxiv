- **[Multi-Loco: Unifying Multi-Embodiment Legged Locomotion via Reinforcement Learning Augmented Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11470)**  `arXiv:2506.11470`  `cs.RO`

  Generalizing locomotion policies across diverse legged robots with varying morphologies is a key challenge due to differences in observation/action dimensions and system dynamics. In this work, we propose Multi-Loco, a novel unified framework combining a morphology-agnostic generative diffusion model with a lightweight residual policy optimized via reinforcement learning (RL). The diffusion model captures morphology-invariant locomotion patterns from diverse cross-embodiment datasets, improving generalization and robustness. The residual policy is shared across all embodiments and refines the actions generated by the diffusion model, enhancing task-aware performance and robustness for real-world deployment. We evaluated our method with a rich library of four legged robots in both simulation and real-world experiments. Compared to a standard RL framework with PPO, our approach -- replacing the Gaussian policy with a diffusion model and residual term -- achieves a 10.35% average return improvement, with gains up to 13.57% in wheeled-biped locomotion tasks. These results highlight the benefits of cross-embodiment data and composite generative architectures in learning robust, generalized locomotion skills.

  Diffusion models provide a powerful way to incorporate complex prior information for solving inverse problems. However, existing methods struggle to correctly incorporate guidance from conflicting signals in the prior and measurement, especially in the challenging setting of non-Gaussian or unknown noise. To bridge these gaps, we propose Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), a novel framework for linear inverse problem solving that can more flexibly balance prior and measurement information. MAS unifies and extends existing approaches like DDNM and DAPS, and offers a new optimization perspective. MAS can generalize to handle known Gaussian noise, unknown or non-Gaussian noise types. Extensive experiments show that MAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a range of tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The relative balance between physics and data within any physics-informed machine learner is an important modelling consideration to ensure that the benefits of both physics and data-based approaches are maximised. An over reliance on physical knowledge can be detrimental, particularly when the physics-based component of a model may not accurately represent the true underlying system. An underutilisation of physical knowledge potentially wastes a valuable resource, along with benefits in model interpretability and reduced demand for expensive data collection. Achieving an optimal physics-data balance is a challenging aspect of model design, particularly if the level varies through time; for example, one might have a physical approximation, only valid within particular regimes, or a physical phenomenon may be known to only occur when given conditions are met (e.g. at high temperatures). This paper develops novel, physically-informed, change-point kernels for Gaussian processes, capable of dynamically varying the reliance upon available physical knowledge. A high level of control is granted to a user, allowing for the definition of conditions in which they believe a phenomena should occur and the rate at which the knowledge should be phased in and out of a model. In circumstances where users may be less certain, the switching reliance upon physical knowledge may be automatically learned and recovered from the model in an interpretable and intuitive manner. Variation of the modelled noise based on the physical phenomena occurring is also implemented to provide a more representative capture of uncertainty alongside predictions. The capabilities of the new kernel structures are explored through the use of two engineering case studies: the directional wind loading of a cable-stayed bridge and the prediction of aircraft wing strain during in-flight manoeuvring.

- **[Physics-Informed Latent Neural Operator for Real-time Predictions of Complex Physical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08428)**  `arXiv:2501.08428`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep operator network (DeepONet) has shown significant promise as surrogate models for systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), enabling accurate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. However, for complex, high-dimensional systems, these models often require heavily overparameterized networks, leading to long training times and convergence difficulties. Latent DeepONet addresses some of these challenges by introducing a two-step approach: first learning a reduced latent space using a separate model, followed by operator learning within this latent space. While efficient, this method is inherently data-driven and lacks mechanisms for incorporating physical laws, limiting its robustness and generalizability in data-scarce settings. In this work, we propose PI-Latent-NO, a physics-informed latent neural operator framework that integrates governing physics directly into the learning process. Our architecture features two coupled DeepONets trained end-to-end: a Latent-DeepONet that learns a low-dimensional representation of the solution, and a Reconstruction-DeepONet that maps this latent representation back to the physical space. By embedding PDE constraints into the training via automatic differentiation, our method eliminates the need for labeled training data and ensures physics-consistent predictions. The proposed framework is both memory and compute-efficient, exhibiting near-constant scaling with problem size and demonstrating significant speedups over traditional physics-informed operator models. We validate our approach on a range of high-dimensional parametric PDEs, showcasing its accuracy, scalability, and suitability for real-time prediction in complex physical systems.

- **[How Visual Representations Map to Language Feature Space in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11976)**  `arXiv:2506.11976`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models (VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains its original language representations without adaptation to visual data. Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations gradually align with language feature representations, converging in middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation learning.

- **[FIMA-Q: Post-Training Quantization for Vision Transformers by Fisher Information Matrix Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11543)**  `arXiv:2506.11543`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Zhuguanyu Wu, Shihe Wang, Jiayi Zhang, Jiaxin Chen, Yunhong Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization.

- **[Aligned Novel View Image and Geometry Synthesis via Cross-modal Attention Instillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11924)**  `arXiv:2506.11924`  `cs.CV`  
  _Min-Seop Kwak, Junho Kim, Sangdoo Yun, Dongyoon Han, Taekyoung Kim, Seungryong Kim, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry, we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for comprehensive 3D completion.

- **[Cross-Modal Clustering-Guided Negative Sampling for Self-Supervised Joint Learning from Medical Images and Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11674)**  `arXiv:2506.11674`  `cs.CV`  
  _Libin Lan, Hongxing Li, Zunhui Xia, Juan Zhou, Xiaofei Zhu, Yongmei Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and reports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and efficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing models suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of negative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion of false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking the fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition tasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but ignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis. Motivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal Cluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First, it extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the single-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention. This improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model representation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image Reconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features obtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions. This module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information interaction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for downstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed CM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable for various recognition tasks. Extensive experimental results on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five downstream datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple metrics, verifying its superior performance.

- **[SemanticSplat: Feed-Forward 3D Scene Understanding with Language-Aware Gaussian Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09565)**  `arXiv:2506.09565`  `cs.CV`  
  _Qijing Li, Jingxiang Sun, Liang An, Zhaoqi Su, Hongwen Zhang, Yebin Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Holistic 3D scene understanding, which jointly models geometry, appearance, and semantics, is crucial for applications like augmented reality and robotic interaction. Existing feed-forward 3D scene understanding methods (e.g., LSM) are limited to extracting language-based semantics from scenes, failing to achieve holistic scene comprehension. Additionally, they suffer from low-quality geometry reconstruction and noisy artifacts. In contrast, per-scene optimization methods rely on dense input views, which reduces practicality and increases complexity during deployment. In this paper, we propose SemanticSplat, a feed-forward semantic-aware 3D reconstruction method, which unifies 3D Gaussians with latent semantic attributes for joint geometry-appearance-semantics modeling. To predict the semantic anisotropic Gaussians, SemanticSplat fuses diverse feature fields (e.g., LSeg, SAM) with a cost volume representation that stores cross-view feature similarities, enhancing coherent and accurate scene comprehension. Leveraging a two-stage distillation framework, SemanticSplat reconstructs a holistic multi-modal semantic feature field from sparse-view images. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for 3D scene understanding tasks like promptable and open-vocabulary segmentation. Video results are available atthis https URL.

- **[A Self-supervised Motion Representation for Portrait Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10096)**  `arXiv:2503.10096`  `cs.CV`  
  _Qiyuan Zhang, Chenyu Wu, Wenzhang Sun, Huaize Liu, Donglin Di, Wei Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in portrait video generation have been noteworthy. However, existing methods rely heavily on human priors and pre-trained generative models, Motion representations based on human priors may introduce unrealistic motion, while methods relying on pre-trained generative models often suffer from inefficient inference. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic Latent Motion (SeMo), a compact and expressive motion representation. Leveraging this representation, our approach achieve both high-quality visual results and efficient inference. SeMo follows an effective three-step framework: Abstraction, Reasoning, and Generation. First, in the Abstraction step, we use a carefully designed Masked Motion Encoder, which leverages a self-supervised learning paradigm to compress the subject's motion state into a compact and abstract latent motion (1D token). Second, in the Reasoning step, we efficiently generate motion sequences based on the driving audio signal. Finally, in the Generation step, the motion dynamics serve as conditional information to guide the motion decoder in synthesizing realistic transitions from reference frame to target video. Thanks to the compact and expressive nature of Semantic Latent Motion, our method achieves efficient motion representation and high-quality video generation. User studies demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art models with an 81% win rate in realism. Extensive experiments further highlight its strong compression capability, reconstruction quality, and generative potential.

- **[FrugalNeRF: Fast Convergence for Extreme Few-shot Novel View Synthesis without Learned Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16271)**  `arXiv:2410.16271`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chin-Yang Lin, Chung-Ho Wu, Chang-Han Yeh, Shih-Han Yen, Cheng Sun, Yu-Lun Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) face significant challenges in extreme few-shot scenarios, primarily due to overfitting and long training times. Existing methods, such as FreeNeRF and SparseNeRF, use frequency regularization or pre-trained priors but struggle with complex scheduling and bias. We introduce FrugalNeRF, a novel few-shot NeRF framework that leverages weight-sharing voxels across multiple scales to efficiently represent scene details. Our key contribution is a cross-scale geometric adaptation scheme that selects pseudo ground truth depth based on reprojection errors across scales. This guides training without relying on externally learned priors, enabling full utilization of the training data. It can also integrate pre-trained priors, enhancing quality without slowing convergence. Experiments on LLFF, DTU, and RealEstate-10K show that FrugalNeRF outperforms other few-shot NeRF methods while significantly reducing training time, making it a practical solution for efficient and accurate 3D scene reconstruction.

- **[BitNet v2: Native 4-bit Activations with Hadamard Transformation for 1-bit LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18415)**  `arXiv:2504.18415`  `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Hongyu Wang, Shuming Ma, Furu Wei_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient deployment of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs) is hindered by activation outliers, which complicate quantization to low bit-widths. We introduce BitNet v2, a novel framework enabling native 4-bit activation quantization for 1-bit LLMs. To tackle outliers in attention and feed-forward network activations, we propose H-BitLinear, a module applying an online Hadamard transformation prior to activation quantization. This transformation smooths sharp activation distributions into more Gaussian-like forms, suitable for low-bit representation. Experiments show BitNet v2 trained from scratch with 8-bit activations matches BitNet b1.58 performance. Crucially, BitNet v2 achieves minimal performance degradation when trained with native 4-bit activations, significantly reducing memory footprint and computational cost for batched inference.

  _Alexey Tikhonov, Sergei Shteiner, Anna Bykova, Ivan P. Yamshchikov_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Russenorsk, a pidgin language historically used in trade interactions between Russian and Norwegian speakers, represents a unique linguistic phenomenon. In this paper, we attempt to analyze its lexicon using modern large language models (LLMs), based on surviving literary sources. We construct a structured dictionary of the language, grouped by synonyms and word origins. Subsequently, we use this dictionary to formulate hypotheses about the core principles of word formation and grammatical structure in Russenorsk and show which hypotheses generated by large language models correspond to the hypotheses previously proposed ones in the academic literature. We also develop a "reconstruction" translation agent that generates hypothetical Russenorsk renderings of contemporary Russian and Norwegian texts.

- **[LLaVA-CMoE: Towards Continual Mixture of Experts for Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21227)**  `arXiv:2503.21227`  `cs.CL`  
  _Hengyuan Zhao, Ziqin Wang, Qixin Sun, Kaiyou Song, Yilin Li, Xiaolin Hu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have recently advanced the scalability and adaptability of large language models (LLMs) for continual multimodal learning. However, efficiently extending these models to accommodate sequential tasks remains challenging. As new tasks arrive, naive model expansion leads to rapid parameter growth, while modifying shared routing components often causes catastrophic forgetting, undermining previously learned knowledge. To address these issues, we propose LLaVA-CMoE, a continual learning framework for LLMs that requires no replay data of previous tasks and ensures both parameter efficiency and robust knowledge retention. Our approach introduces a Probe-Guided Knowledge Extension mechanism, which uses probe experts to dynamically determine when and where new experts should be added, enabling adaptive and minimal parameter expansion tailored to task complexity. Furthermore, we present a Probabilistic Task Locator that assigns each task a dedicated, lightweight router. To handle the practical issue that task labels are unknown during inference, we leverage a VAE-based reconstruction strategy to identify the most suitable router by matching input distributions, allowing automatic and accurate expert allocation. This design mitigates routing conflicts and catastrophic forgetting, enabling robust continual learning without explicit task labels. Extensive experiments on the CoIN benchmark, covering eight diverse VQA tasks, demonstrate that LLaVA-CMoE delivers strong continual learning performance with a compact model size, significantly reducing forgetting and parameter overhead compared to prior methods. These results showcase the effectiveness and scalability of our approach for parameter-efficient continual learning in large language models. Our code will be open-sourced soon.
