  Autonomous aerial robots are becoming commonplace in our lives. Hands-on aerial robotics courses are pivotal in training the next-generation workforce to meet the growing market demands. Such an efficient and compelling course depends on a reliable testbed. In this paper, we present VizFlyt, an open-source perception-centric Hardware-In-The-Loop (HITL) photorealistic testing framework for aerial robotics courses. We utilize pose from an external localization system to hallucinate real-time and photorealistic visual sensors using 3D Gaussian Splatting. This enables stress-free testing of autonomy algorithms on aerial robots without the risk of crashing into obstacles. We achieve over 100Hz of system update rate. Lastly, we build upon our past experiences of offering hands-on aerial robotics courses and propose a new open-source and open-hardware curriculum based on VizFlyt for the future. We test our framework on various course projects in real-world HITL experiments and present the results showing the efficacy of such a system and its large potential use cases.

- **[On the Implicit Relation Between Low-Rank Adaptation and Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17538)**  `arXiv:2409.17538`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  A significant approach in natural language processing involves large-scale pre-training of models on general domain data followed by their adaptation to specific tasks or domains. As models grow in size, full fine-tuning all of their parameters becomes increasingly impractical. To address this, some methods for low-rank task adaptation of language models have been proposed, e.g., LoRA and FLoRA. These methods keep the pre-trained model weights fixed and incorporate trainable low-rank decomposition matrices into some layers of the transformer architecture, called adapters. This approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters required for downstream tasks compared to full fine-tuning all parameters. In this work, we look at low-rank adaptation from the lens of data privacy. We show theoretically that the low-rank adaptation used in LoRA and FLoRA leads to the injection of some random noise into the batch gradients w.r.t the adapter parameters. We quantify the variance of the injected noise and show that the smaller the adaptation rank, the larger the noise variance. By establishing a Berry-Esseen type bound on the total variation distance between distribution of the injected noise and a Gaussian distribution with the same variance, we show that the dynamics of low-rank adaptation is close to that of differentially private fine-tuning of the adapters. Finally, using Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, we show that when augmented with gradient scaling, low-rank adaptation is very close to performing DPSGD algorithm with a fixed noise scale to fine-tune the adapters. Suggested by our theoretical findings and approved by our experimental results, we show that low-rank adaptation, besides mitigating the space and computational complexities, implicitly provides a privacy protection w.r.t the fine-tuning data, without inducing the high space complexity of DPSGD.

- **[Dynamic Graph Structure Estimation for Learning Multivariate Point Process using Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01246)**  `arXiv:2504.01246`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modeling and predicting temporal point processes (TPPs) is critical in domains such as neuroscience, epidemiology, finance, and social sciences. We introduce the Spiking Dynamic Graph Network (SDGN), a novel framework that leverages the temporal processing capabilities of spiking neural networks (SNNs) and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to dynamically estimate underlying spatio-temporal functional graphs. Unlike existing methods that rely on predefined or static graph structures, SDGN adapts to any dataset by learning dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies directly from the event data, enhancing generalizability and robustness. While SDGN offers significant improvements over prior methods, we acknowledge its limitations in handling dense graphs and certain non-Gaussian dependencies, providing opportunities for future refinement. Our evaluations, conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets including NYC Taxi, 911, Reddit, and Stack Overflow, demonstrate that SDGN achieves superior predictive accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we include ablation studies to highlight the contributions of its core components.

- **[High Dimensional Bayesian Optimization using Lasso Variable Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01743)**  `arXiv:2504.01743`  `cs.LG`  
  _Vu Viet Hoang, Hung The Tran, Sunil Gupta, Vu Nguyen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bayesian optimization (BO) is a leading method for optimizing expensive black-box optimization and has been successfully applied across various scenarios. However, BO suffers from the curse of dimensionality, making it challenging to scale to high-dimensional problems. Existing work has adopted a variable selection strategy to select and optimize only a subset of variables iteratively. Although this approach can mitigate the high-dimensional challenge in BO, it still leads to sample inefficiency. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method that identifies important variables by estimating the length scales of Gaussian process kernels. Next, we construct an effective search region consisting of multiple subspaces and optimize the acquisition function within this region, focusing on only the important variables. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves cumulative regret with a sublinear growth rate in the worst case while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments on high-dimensional synthetic functions and real-world problems show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved impressive results in real-time 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, these methods struggle in large-scale, unconstrained environments where sparse and uneven input coverage, transient occlusions, appearance variability, and inconsistent camera settings lead to degraded quality. We propose GS-Diff, a novel 3DGS framework guided by a multi-view diffusion model to address these limitations. By generating pseudo-observations conditioned on multi-view inputs, our method transforms under-constrained 3D reconstruction problems into well-posed ones, enabling robust optimization even with sparse data. GS-Diff further integrates several enhancements, including appearance embedding, monocular depth priors, dynamic object modeling, anisotropy regularization, and advanced rasterization techniques, to tackle geometric and photometric challenges in real-world settings. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that GS-Diff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins.

- **[GaussianLSS -- Toward Real-world BEV Perception: Depth Uncertainty Estimation via Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01957)**  `arXiv:2504.01957`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shu-Wei Lu, Yi-Hsuan Tsai, Yi-Ting Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bird's-eye view (BEV) perception has gained significant attention because it provides a unified representation to fuse multiple view images and enables a wide range of down-stream autonomous driving tasks, such as forecasting and planning. Recent state-of-the-art models utilize projection-based methods which formulate BEV perception as query learning to bypass explicit depth estimation. While we observe promising advancements in this paradigm, they still fall short of real-world applications because of the lack of uncertainty modeling and expensive computational requirement. In this work, we introduce GaussianLSS, a novel uncertainty-aware BEV perception framework that revisits unprojection-based methods, specifically the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) paradigm, and enhances them with depth un-certainty modeling. GaussianLSS represents spatial dispersion by learning a soft depth mean and computing the variance of the depth distribution, which implicitly captures object extents. We then transform the depth distribution into 3D Gaussians and rasterize them to construct uncertainty-aware BEV features. We evaluate GaussianLSS on the nuScenes dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to unprojection-based methods. In particular, it provides significant advantages in speed, running 2.5x faster, and in memory efficiency, using 0.3x less memory compared to projection-based methods, while achieving competitive performance with only a 0.4% IoU difference.

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) proposes an efficient solution for novel view synthesis. Its framework provides fast and high-fidelity rendering. Although less complex than other solutions such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), there are still some challenges building smaller models without sacrificing quality. In this study, we perform a careful analysis of 3DGS training process and propose a new optimization methodology. Our Better Optimized Gaussian Splatting (BOGausS) solution is able to generate models up to ten times lighter than the original 3DGS with no quality degradation, thus significantly boosting the performance of Gaussian Splatting compared to the state of the art.

- **[FIORD: A Fisheye Indoor-Outdoor Dataset with LIDAR Ground Truth for 3D Scene Reconstruction and Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01732)**  `arXiv:2504.01732`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The development of large-scale 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis methods mostly rely on datasets comprising perspective images with narrow fields of view (FoV). While effective for small-scale scenes, these datasets require large image sets and extensive structure-from-motion (SfM) processing, limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce a fisheye image dataset tailored for scene reconstruction tasks. Using dual 200-degree fisheye lenses, our dataset provides full 360-degree coverage of 5 indoor and 5 outdoor scenes. Each scene has sparse SfM point clouds and precise LIDAR-derived dense point clouds that can be used as geometric ground-truth, enabling robust benchmarking under challenging conditions such as occlusions and reflections. While the baseline experiments focus on vanilla Gaussian Splatting and NeRF based Nerfacto methods, the dataset supports diverse approaches for scene reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and image-based rendering.

- **[RealityAvatar: Towards Realistic Loose Clothing Modeling in Animatable 3D Gaussian Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01559)**  `arXiv:2504.01559`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yahui Li, Zhi Zeng, Liming Pang, Guixuan Zhang, Shuwu Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modeling animatable human avatars from monocular or multi-view videos has been widely studied, with recent approaches leveraging neural radiance fields (NeRFs) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieving impressive results in novel-view and novel-pose synthesis. However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture the dynamics of loose clothing, as they primarily rely on global pose conditioning or static per-frame representations, leading to oversmoothing and temporal inconsistencies in non-rigid regions. To address this, We propose RealityAvatar, an efficient framework for high-fidelity digital human modeling, specifically targeting loosely dressed avatars. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to capture complex clothing deformations and motion dynamics while ensuring geometric consistency. By incorporating a motion trend module and a latentbone encoder, we explicitly model pose-dependent deformations and temporal variations in clothing behavior. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing fine-grained clothing deformations and motion-driven shape variations. Our method significantly enhances structural fidelity and perceptual quality in dynamic human reconstruction, particularly in non-rigid regions, while achieving better consistency across temporal frames.

- **[Luminance-GS: Adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting to Challenging Lighting Conditions with View-Adaptive Curve Adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01503)**  `arXiv:2504.01503`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Capturing high-quality photographs under diverse real-world lighting conditions is challenging, as both natural lighting (e.g., low-light) and camera exposure settings (e.g., exposure time) significantly impact image quality. This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-view scenarios, where variations in lighting and image signal processor (ISP) settings across viewpoints introduce photometric inconsistencies. Such lighting degradations and view-dependent variations pose substantial challenges to novel view synthesis (NVS) frameworks based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). To address this, we introduce Luminance-GS, a novel approach to achieving high-quality novel view synthesis results under diverse challenging lighting conditions using 3DGS. By adopting per-view color matrix mapping and view-adaptive curve adjustments, Luminance-GS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across various lighting conditions -- including low-light, overexposure, and varying exposure -- while not altering the original 3DGS explicit representation. Compared to previous NeRF- and 3DGS-based baselines, Luminance-GS provides real-time rendering speed with improved reconstruction quality.

- **[Safeguarding Vision-Language Models: Mitigating Vulnerabilities to Gaussian Noise in Perturbation-based Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01308)**  `arXiv:2504.01308`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jiawei Wang, Yushen Zuo, Yuanjun Chai, Zhendong Liu, Yichen Fu, Yichun Feng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating visual information, yet they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, especially when processing noisy or corrupted images. Although existing VLMs adopt security measures during training to mitigate such attacks, vulnerabilities associated with noise-augmented visual inputs are overlooked. In this work, we identify that missing noise-augmented training causes critical security gaps: many VLMs are susceptible to even simple perturbations such as Gaussian noise. To address this challenge, we propose Robust-VLGuard, a multimodal safety dataset with aligned / misaligned image-text pairs, combined with noise-augmented fine-tuning that reduces attack success rates while preserving functionality of VLM. For stronger optimization-based visual perturbation attacks, we propose DiffPure-VLM, leveraging diffusion models to convert adversarial perturbations into Gaussian-like noise, which can be defended by VLMs with noise-augmented safety fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the distribution-shifting property of diffusion model aligns well with our fine-tuned VLMs, significantly mitigating adversarial perturbations across varying intensities. The dataset and code are available atthis https URL.

- **[Dinomaly: The Less Is More Philosophy in Multi-Class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14325)**  `arXiv:2405.14325`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jia Guo, Shuai Lu, Weihang Zhang, Fang Chen, Huiqi Li, Hongen Liao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies highlighted a practical setting of unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) that builds a unified model for multi-class images. Despite various advancements addressing this challenging task, the detection performance under the multi-class setting still lags far behind state-of-the-art class-separated models. Our research aims to bridge this substantial performance gap. In this paper, we introduce a minimalistic reconstruction-based anomaly detection framework, namely Dinomaly, which leverages pure Transformer architectures without relying on complex designs, additional modules, or specialized tricks. Given this powerful framework consisted of only Attentions and MLPs, we found four simple components that are essential to multi-class anomaly detection: (1) Foundation Transformers that extracts universal and discriminative features, (2) Noisy Bottleneck where pre-existing Dropouts do all the noise injection tricks, (3) Linear Attention that naturally cannot focus, and (4) Loose Reconstruction that does not force layer-to-layer and point-by-point reconstruction. Extensive experiments are conducted across popular anomaly detection benchmarks including MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD. Our proposed Dinomaly achieves impressive image-level AUROC of 99.6%, 98.7%, and 89.3% on the three datasets respectively, which is not only superior to state-of-the-art multi-class UAD methods, but also achieves the most advanced class-separated UAD records.

- **[DreamScape: 3D Scene Creation via Gaussian Splatting joint Correlation Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09227)**  `arXiv:2404.09227`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yueming Zhao, Xuening Yuan, Hongyu Yang, Di Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in text-to-3D creation integrate the potent prior of Diffusion Models from text-to-image generation into 3D domain. Nevertheless, generating 3D scenes with multiple objects remains challenging. Therefore, we present DreamScape, a method for generating 3D scenes from text. Utilizing Gaussian Splatting for 3D representation, DreamScape introduces 3D Gaussian Guide that encodes semantic primitives, spatial transformations and relationships from text using LLMs, enabling local-to-global optimization. Progressive scale control is tailored during local object generation, addressing training instability issue arising from simple blending in the global optimization stage. Collision relationships between objects are modeled at the global level to mitigate biases in LLMs priors, ensuring physical correctness. Additionally, to generate pervasive objects like rain and snow distributed extensively across the scene, we design specialized sparse initialization and densification strategy. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScape achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling high-fidelity, controllable 3D scene generation.
