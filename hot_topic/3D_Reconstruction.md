- **[UAV See, UGV Do: Aerial Imagery and Virtual Teach Enabling Zero-Shot Ground Vehicle Repeat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16912)**  `arXiv:2505.16912`  `cs.RO`

  This paper presents Virtual Teach and Repeat (VirT&R): an extension of the Teach and Repeat (T&R) framework that enables GPS-denied, zero-shot autonomous ground vehicle navigation in untraversed environments. VirT&R leverages aerial imagery captured for a target environment to train a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model so that dense point clouds and photo-textured meshes can be extracted. The NeRF mesh is used to create a high-fidelity simulation of the environment for piloting an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to virtually define a desired path. The mission can then be executed in the actual target environment by using NeRF-derived point cloud submaps associated along the path and an existing LiDAR Teach and Repeat (LT&R) framework. We benchmark the repeatability of VirT&R on over 12 km of autonomous driving data using physical markings that allow a sim-to-real lateral path-tracking error to be obtained and compared with LT&R. VirT&R achieved measured root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 19.5 cm and 18.4 cm in two different environments, which are slightly less than one tire width (24 cm) on the robot used for testing, and respective maximum errors were 39.4 cm and 47.6 cm. This was done using only the NeRF-derived teach map, demonstrating that VirT&R has similar closed-loop path-tracking performance to LT&R but does not require a human to manually teach the path to the UGV in the actual environment.

- **[Interpretability Illusions with Sparse Autoencoders: Evaluating Robustness of Concept Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16004)**  `arXiv:2505.16004`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are commonly used to interpret the internal activations of large language models (LLMs) by mapping them to human-interpretable concept representations. While existing evaluations of SAEs focus on metrics such as the reconstruction-sparsity tradeoff, human (auto-)interpretability, and feature disentanglement, they overlook a critical aspect: the robustness of concept representations to input perturbations. We argue that robustness must be a fundamental consideration for concept representations, reflecting the fidelity of concept labeling. To this end, we formulate robustness quantification as input-space optimization problems and develop a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring realistic scenarios in which adversarial perturbations are crafted to manipulate SAE representations. Empirically, we find that tiny adversarial input perturbations can effectively manipulate concept-based interpretations in most scenarios without notably affecting the outputs of the base LLMs themselves. Overall, our results suggest that SAE concept representations are fragile and may be ill-suited for applications in model monitoring and oversight.

- **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790)**  `arXiv:2505.16790`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Hyunjin Seo, Taewon Kim, Sihyun Yu, SungSoo Ahn_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.

  Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, necessitating the development of accurate and reliable predictive models to facilitate early detection and intervention. While state of the art work has focused on various machine learning approaches for predicting heart disease, but they could not able to achieve remarkable accuracy. In response to this need, we applied nine machine learning algorithms XGBoost, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), gaussian na√Øve bayes (NB gaussian), adaptive boosting, and linear regression to predict heart disease based on a range of physiological indicators. Our approach involved feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant predictors, aimed at refining the models to enhance both performance and interpretability. The models were trained, incorporating processes such as grid search hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to minimize overfitting. Additionally, we have developed a novel voting system with feature selection techniques to advance heart disease classification. Furthermore, we have evaluated the models using key performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC). Among the models, XGBoost demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 99% accuracy, precision, F1-Score, 98% recall, and 100% ROC AUC. This study offers a promising approach to early heart disease diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

- **[Learning Fused State Representations for Control from Multi-View Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01316)**  `arXiv:2502.01316`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  Multi-View Reinforcement Learning (MVRL) seeks to provide agents with multi-view observations, enabling them to perceive environment with greater effectiveness and precision. Recent advancements in MVRL focus on extracting latent representations from multiview observations and leveraging them in control tasks. However, it is not straightforward to learn compact and task-relevant representations, particularly in the presence of redundancy, distracting information, or missing views. In this paper, we propose Multi-view Fusion State for Control (MFSC), firstly incorporating bisimulation metric learning into MVRL to learn task-relevant representations. Furthermore, we propose a multiview-based mask and latent reconstruction auxiliary task that exploits shared information across views and improves MFSC's robustness in missing views by introducing a mask token. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in MVRL tasks. Even in more realistic scenarios with interference or missing views, MFSC consistently maintains high performance.

- **[Multi-Output Gaussian Processes for Graph-Structured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16755)**  `arXiv:2505.16755`  `cs.LG`  
  _Ayano Nakai-Kasai, Tadashi Wadayama_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph-structured data is a type of data to be obtained associated with a graph structure where vertices and edges describe some kind of data correlation. This paper proposes a regression method on graph-structured data, which is based on multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGP), to capture both the correlation between vertices and the correlation between associated data. The proposed formulation is built on the definition of MOGP. This allows it to be applied to a wide range of data configurations and scenarios. Moreover, it has high expressive capability due to its flexibility in kernel design. It includes existing methods of Gaussian processes for graph-structured data as special cases and is possible to remove restrictions on data configurations, model selection, and inference scenarios in the existing methods. The performance of extensions achievable by the proposed formulation is evaluated through computer experiments with synthetic and real data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Causal discovery for dynamical systems poses a major challenge in fields where active interventions are infeasible. Most methods used to investigate these systems and their associated benchmarks are tailored to deterministic, low-dimensional and weakly nonlinear time-series data. To address these limitations, we present CausalDynamics, a large-scale benchmark and extensible data generation framework to advance the structural discovery of dynamical causal models. Our benchmark consists of true causal graphs derived from thousands of coupled ordinary and stochastic differential equations as well as two idealized climate models. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms for graph reconstruction on systems with noisy, confounded, and lagged dynamics. CausalDynamics consists of a plug-and-play, build-your-own coupling workflow that enables the construction of a hierarchy of physical systems. We anticipate that our framework will facilitate the development of robust causal discovery algorithms that are broadly applicable across domains while addressing their unique challenges. We provide a user-friendly implementation and documentation onthis https URL.

- **[FR-Mamba: Time-Series Physical Field Reconstruction Based on State Space Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16083)**  `arXiv:2505.16083`  `cs.LG`  
  _Jiahuan Long, Wenzhe Zhang, Ning Wang, Tingsong Jiang, Wen Yao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physical field reconstruction (PFR) aims to predict the state distribution of physical quantities (e.g., velocity, pressure, and temperature) based on limited sensor measurements. It plays a critical role in domains such as fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. However, existing deep learning methods often fail to capture long-range temporal dependencies, resulting in suboptimal performance on time-evolving physical systems. To address this, we propose FR-Mamba, a novel spatiotemporal flow field reconstruction framework based on state space modeling. Specifically, we design a hybrid neural network architecture that combines Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and State Space Model (SSM) to capture both global spatial features and long-range temporal dependencies. We adopt Mamba, a recently proposed efficient SSM architecture, to model long-range temporal dependencies with linear time complexity. In parallel, the FNO is employed to capture non-local spatial features by leveraging frequency-domain transformations. The spatiotemporal representations extracted by these two components are then fused to reconstruct the full-field distribution of the physical system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing PFR methods in flow field reconstruction tasks, achieving high-accuracy performance on long sequences.

- **[Ensembling Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16077)**  `arXiv:2505.16077`  `cs.LG`  
  _Soham Gadgil, Chris Lin, Su-In Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations into human-interpretable features. Typically, features learned by a single SAE are used for downstream applications. However, it has recently been shown that SAEs trained with different initial weights can learn different features, demonstrating that a single SAE captures only a limited subset of features that can be extracted from the activation space. Motivated by this limitation, we propose to ensemble multiple SAEs through naive bagging and boosting. Specifically, SAEs trained with different weight initializations are ensembled in naive bagging, whereas SAEs sequentially trained to minimize the residual error are ensembled in boosting. We evaluate our ensemble approaches with three settings of language models and SAE architectures. Our empirical results demonstrate that ensembling SAEs can improve the reconstruction of language model activations, diversity of features, and SAE stability. Furthermore, ensembling SAEs performs better than applying a single SAE on downstream tasks such as concept detection and spurious correlation removal, showing improved practical utility.

- **[Fractal Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11356)**  `arXiv:2505.11356`  `cs.LG`  
  _Nero Z. Li, Xuehao Zhai, Zhichao Shi, Boshen Shi, Xuhui Jiang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has attracted considerable attention in the field of graph self-supervised learning, its performance heavily relies on data augmentations that are expected to generate semantically consistent positive pairs. Existing strategies typically resort to random perturbations or local structure preservation, yet lack explicit control over global structural consistency between augmented views. To address this limitation, we propose Fractal Graph Contrastive Learning (FractalGCL), a theory-driven framework that leverages fractal self-similarity to enforce global topological coherence. FractalGCL introduces two key innovations: a renormalisation-based augmentation that generates structurally aligned positive views via box coverings; and a fractal-dimension-aware contrastive loss that aligns graph embeddings according to their fractal dimensions. While combining the two innovations markedly boosts graph-representation quality, it also adds non-trivial computational overhead. To mitigate the computational overhead of fractal dimension estimation, we derive a one-shot estimator by proving that the dimension discrepancy between original and renormalised graphs converges weakly to a centred Gaussian distribution. This theoretical insight enables a reduction in dimension computation cost by an order of magnitude, cutting overall training time by approximately 61%. The experiments show that FractalGCL not only delivers state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks but also outperforms traditional baselines on traffic networks by an average margin of about remarkably 7%.

- **[RealEngine: Simulating Autonomous Driving in Realistic Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16902)**  `arXiv:2505.16902`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Junzhe Jiang, Nan Song, Jingyu Li, Xiatian Zhu, Li Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Driving simulation plays a crucial role in developing reliable driving agents by providing controlled, evaluative environments. To enable meaningful assessments, a high-quality driving simulator must satisfy several key requirements: multi-modal sensing capabilities (e.g., camera and LiDAR) with realistic scene rendering to minimize observational discrepancies; closed-loop evaluation to support free-form trajectory behaviors; highly diverse traffic scenarios for thorough evaluation; multi-agent cooperation to capture interaction dynamics; and high computational efficiency to ensure affordability and scalability. However, existing simulators and benchmarks fail to comprehensively meet these fundamental criteria. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces RealEngine, a novel driving simulation framework that holistically integrates 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis techniques to achieve realistic and flexible closed-loop simulation in the driving context. By leveraging real-world multi-modal sensor data, RealEngine reconstructs background scenes and foreground traffic participants separately, allowing for highly diverse and realistic traffic scenarios through flexible scene composition. This synergistic fusion of scene reconstruction and view synthesis enables photorealistic rendering across multiple sensor modalities, ensuring both perceptual fidelity and geometric accuracy. Building upon this environment, RealEngine supports three essential driving simulation categories: non-reactive simulation, safety testing, and multi-agent interaction, collectively forming a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the real-world performance of driving agents.

  _Haiming Zhang, Wending Zhou, Yiyao Zhu, Xu Yan, Jiantao Gao, Dongfeng Bai, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces VisionPAD, a novel self-supervised pre-training paradigm designed for vision-centric algorithms in autonomous driving. In contrast to previous approaches that employ neural rendering with explicit depth supervision, VisionPAD utilizes more efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct multi-view representations using only images as supervision. Specifically, we introduce a self-supervised method for voxel velocity estimation. By warping voxels to adjacent frames and supervising the rendered outputs, the model effectively learns motion cues in the sequential data. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-frame photometric consistency approach to enhance geometric perception. It projects adjacent frames to the current frame based on rendered depths and relative poses, boosting the 3D geometric representation through pure image supervision. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that VisionPAD significantly improves performance in 3D object detection, occupancy prediction and map segmentation, surpassing state-of-the-art pre-training strategies by a considerable margin.

- **[Learning Adaptive and Temporally Causal Video Tokenization in a 1D Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17011)**  `arXiv:2505.17011`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yan Li, Changyao Tian, Renqiu Xia, Ning Liao, Weiwei Guo, Junchi Yan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose AdapTok, an adaptive temporal causal video tokenizer that can flexibly allocate tokens for different frames based on video content. AdapTok is equipped with a block-wise masking strategy that randomly drops tail tokens of each block during training, and a block causal scorer to predict the reconstruction quality of video frames using different numbers of tokens. During inference, an adaptive token allocation strategy based on integer linear programming is further proposed to adjust token usage given predicted scores. Such design allows for sample-wise, content-aware, and temporally dynamic token allocation under a controllable overall budget. Extensive experiments for video reconstruction and generation on UCF-101 and Kinetics-600 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Without additional image data, AdapTok consistently improves reconstruction quality and generation performance under different token budgets, allowing for more scalable and token-efficient generative video modeling.

- **[Conditional Panoramic Image Generation via Masked Autoregressive Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16862)**  `arXiv:2505.16862`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chaoyang Wang, Xiangtai Li, Lu Qi, Xiaofan Lin, Jinbin Bai, Qianyu Zhou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent progress in panoramic image generation has underscored two critical limitations in existing approaches. First, most methods are built upon diffusion models, which are inherently ill-suited for equirectangular projection (ERP) panoramas due to the violation of the identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise assumption caused by their spherical mapping. Second, these methods often treat text-conditioned generation (text-to-panorama) and image-conditioned generation (panorama outpainting) as separate tasks, relying on distinct architectures and task-specific data. In this work, we propose a unified framework, Panoramic AutoRegressive model (PAR), which leverages masked autoregressive modeling to address these challenges. PAR avoids the i.i.d. assumption constraint and integrates text and image conditioning into a cohesive architecture, enabling seamless generation across tasks. To address the inherent discontinuity in existing generative models, we introduce circular padding to enhance spatial coherence and propose a consistency alignment strategy to improve generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive performance in text-to-image generation and panorama outpainting tasks while showcasing promising scalability and generalization capabilities.

- **[V2V: Scaling Event-Based Vision through Efficient Video-to-Voxel Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16797)**  `arXiv:2505.16797`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hanyue Lou, Jinxiu Liang, Minggui Teng, Yi Wang, Boxin Shi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Event-based cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption. However, the massive storage requirements and I/O burdens of existing synthetic data generation pipelines and the scarcity of real data prevent event-based training datasets from scaling up, limiting the development and generalization capabilities of event vision models. To address this challenge, we introduce Video-to-Voxel (V2V), an approach that directly converts conventional video frames into event-based voxel grid representations, bypassing the storage-intensive event stream generation entirely. V2V enables a 150 times reduction in storage requirements while supporting on-the-fly parameter randomization for enhanced model robustness. Leveraging this efficiency, we train several video reconstruction and optical flow estimation model architectures on 10,000 diverse videos totaling 52 hours--an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets, yielding substantial improvements.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a high-fidelity and efficient paradigm for online free-viewpoint video (FVV) reconstruction, offering viewers rapid responsiveness and immersive experiences. However, existing online methods face challenge in prohibitive storage requirements primarily due to point-wise modeling that fails to exploit the motion properties. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Compact Gaussian Streaming (ComGS) framework, leveraging the locality and consistency of motion in dynamic scene, that models object-consistent Gaussian point motion through keypoint-driven motion representation. By transmitting only the keypoint attributes, this framework provides a more storage-efficient solution. Specifically, we first identify a sparse set of motion-sensitive keypoints localized within motion regions using a viewspace gradient difference strategy. Equipped with these keypoints, we propose an adaptive motion-driven mechanism that predicts a spatial influence field for propagating keypoint motion to neighboring Gaussian points with similar motion. Moreover, ComGS adopts an error-aware correction strategy for key frame reconstruction that selectively refines erroneous regions and mitigates error accumulation without unnecessary overhead. Overall, ComGS achieves a remarkable storage reduction of over 159 X compared to 3DGStream and 14 X compared to the SOTA method QUEEN, while maintaining competitive visual fidelity and rendering speed. Our code will be released.

  _Siwei Meng, Yawei Luo, Ping Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in static 3D generation have intensified the demand for physically consistent dynamic 3D content. However, existing video generation models, including diffusion-based methods, often prioritize visual realism while neglecting physical plausibility, resulting in implausible object dynamics. Prior approaches for physics-aware dynamic generation typically rely on large-scale annotated datasets or extensive model fine-tuning, which imposes significant computational and data collection burdens and limits scalability across scenarios. To address these challenges, we present MAGIC, a training-free framework for single-image physical property inference and dynamic generation, integrating pretrained image-to-video diffusion models with iterative LLM-based reasoning. Our framework generates motion-rich videos from a static image and closes the visual-to-physical gap through a confidence-driven LLM feedback loop that adaptively steers the diffusion model toward physics-relevant motion. To translate visual dynamics into controllable physical behavior, we further introduce a differentiable MPM simulator operating directly on 3D Gaussians reconstructed from the single image, enabling physically grounded, simulation-ready outputs without any supervision or model tuning. Experiments show that MAGIC outperforms existing physics-aware generative methods in inference accuracy and achieves greater temporal coherence than state-of-the-art video diffusion models.

  _Gabby Litterio, Juan-David Lizarazo-Ferro, Pedro Felzenszwalb, Rashid Zia_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We consider the limits of super-resolution using imaging constraints. Due to various theoretical and practical limitations, reconstruction-based methods have been largely restricted to small increases in resolution. In addition, motion-blur is usually seen as a nuisance that impedes super-resolution. We show that by using high-precision motion information, sparse image priors, and convex optimization, it is possible to increase resolution by large factors. A key operation in super-resolution is deconvolution with a box. In general, convolution with a box is not invertible. However, we obtain perfect reconstructions of sparse signals using convex optimization. We also show that motion blur can be helpful for super-resolution. We demonstrate that using pseudo-random motion it is possible to reconstruct a high-resolution target using a single low-resolution image. We present numerical experiments with simulated data and results with real data captured by a camera mounted on a computer controlled stage.

- **[Continuous Representation Methods, Theories, and Applications: An Overview and Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15222)**  `arXiv:2505.15222`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, continuous representation methods emerge as novel paradigms that characterize the intrinsic structures of real-world data through function representations that map positional coordinates to their corresponding values in the continuous space. As compared with the traditional discrete framework, the continuous framework demonstrates inherent superiority for data representation and reconstruction (e.g., image restoration, novel view synthesis, and waveform inversion) by offering inherent advantages including resolution flexibility, cross-modal adaptability, inherent smoothness, and parameter efficiency. In this review, we systematically examine recent advancements in continuous representation frameworks, focusing on three aspects: (i) Continuous representation method designs such as basis function representation, statistical modeling, tensor function decomposition, and implicit neural representation; (ii) Theoretical foundations of continuous representations such as approximation error analysis, convergence property, and implicit regularization; (iii) Real-world applications of continuous representations derived from computer vision, graphics, bioinformatics, and remote sensing. Furthermore, we outline future directions and perspectives to inspire exploration and deepen insights to facilitate continuous representation methods, theories, and applications.

- **[Consistent Quantity-Quality Control across Scenes for Deployment-Aware Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10473)**  `arXiv:2505.10473`  `cs.CV`  
  _Fengdi Zhang, Hongkun Cao, Ruqi Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To reduce storage and computational costs, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) seeks to minimize the number of Gaussians used while preserving high rendering quality, introducing an inherent trade-off between Gaussian quantity and rendering quality. Existing methods strive for better quantity-quality performance, but lack the ability for users to intuitively adjust this trade-off to suit practical needs such as model deployment under diverse hardware and communication constraints. Here, we present ControlGS, a 3DGS optimization method that achieves semantically meaningful and cross-scene consistent quantity-quality control. Through a single training run using a fixed setup and a user-specified hyperparameter reflecting quantity-quality preference, ControlGS can automatically find desirable quantity-quality trade-off points across diverse scenes, from compact objects to large outdoor scenes. It also outperforms baselines by achieving higher rendering quality with fewer Gaussians, and supports a broad adjustment range with stepless control over the trade-off. Project page:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dynamic scene representation and reconstruction have undergone transformative advances in recent years, catalyzed by breakthroughs in neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian splatting techniques. While initially developed for static environments, these methodologies have rapidly evolved to address the complexities inherent in 4D dynamic scenes through an expansive body of research. Coupled with innovations in differentiable volumetric rendering, these approaches have significantly enhanced the quality of motion representation and dynamic scene reconstruction, thereby garnering substantial attention from the computer vision and graphics communities. This survey presents a systematic analysis of over 200 papers focused on dynamic scene representation using radiance field, spanning the spectrum from implicit neural representations to explicit Gaussian primitives. We categorize and evaluate these works through multiple critical lenses: motion representation paradigms, reconstruction techniques for varied scene dynamics, auxiliary information integration strategies, and regularization approaches that ensure temporal consistency and physical plausibility. We organize diverse methodological approaches under a unified representational framework, concluding with a critical examination of persistent challenges and promising research directions. By providing this comprehensive overview, we aim to establish a definitive reference for researchers entering this rapidly evolving field while offering experienced practitioners a systematic understanding of both conceptual principles and practical frontiers in dynamic scene reconstruction.

- **[Fuzzy Information Evolution with Three-Way Decision in Social Network Group Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16781)**  `arXiv:2505.16781`  `cs.AI`  
  _Qianlei Jia, Xinliang Zhou, Ondrej Krejcar, Enrique Herrera-Viedma_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In group decision-making (GDM) scenarios, uncertainty, dynamic social structures, and vague information present major challenges for traditional opinion dynamics models. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel social network group decision-making (SNGDM) framework that integrates three-way decision (3WD) theory, dynamic network reconstruction, and linguistic opinion representation. First, the 3WD mechanism is introduced to explicitly model hesitation and ambiguity in agent judgments, thereby preventing irrational decisions. Second, a connection adjustment rule based on opinion similarity is developed, enabling agents to adaptively update their communication links and better reflect the evolving nature of social relationships. Third, linguistic terms are used to describe agent opinions, allowing the model to handle subjective, vague, or incomplete information more effectively. Finally, an integrated multi-agent decision-making framework is constructed, which simultaneously considers individual uncertainty, opinion evolution, and network dynamics. The proposed model is applied to a multi-UAV cooperative decision-making scenario, where simulation results and consensus analysis demonstrate its effectiveness. Experimental comparisons further verify the advantages of the algorithm in enhancing system stability and representing realistic decision-making behaviors.
