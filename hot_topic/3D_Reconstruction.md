  Learning from demonstration is a promising approach for teaching robots new skills. However, a central challenge in the execution of acquired skills is the ability to recognize faults and prevent failures. This is essential because demonstrations typically cover only a limited set of scenarios and often only the successful ones. During task execution, unforeseen situations may arise, such as changes in the robot's environment or interaction with human operators. To recognize such situations, this paper focuses on teaching the robot situational awareness by using a camera input and labeling frames as safe or risky. We train a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model fed by a low-dimensional latent space representation of the input images. The model outputs a continuous risk score ranging from zero to one, quantifying the degree of risk at each timestep. This allows for pausing task execution in unsafe situations and directly adding new training data, labeled by the human user. Our experiments on a robotic manipulator show that the proposed method can reliably detect both known and novel faults using only a single example for each new fault. In contrast, a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) performs well only on faults it has encountered during training. Our method enables the next generation of cobots to be rapidly deployed with easy-to-set-up, vision-based risk assessment, proactively safeguarding humans and detecting misaligned parts or missing objects before failures occur. We provide all the code and data required to reproduce our experiments atthis http URL.

- **[CaLiV: LiDAR-to-Vehicle Calibration of Arbitrary Sensor Setups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01987)**  `arXiv:2504.01987`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In autonomous systems, sensor calibration is essential for safe and efficient navigation in dynamic environments. Accurate calibration is a prerequisite for reliable perception and planning tasks such as object detection and obstacle avoidance. Many existing LiDAR calibration methods require overlapping fields of view, while others use external sensing devices or postulate a feature-rich environment. In addition, Sensor-to-Vehicle calibration is not supported by the vast majority of calibration algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel target-based technique for extrinsic Sensor-to-Sensor and Sensor-to-Vehicle calibration of multi-LiDAR systems called CaLiV. This algorithm works for non-overlapping fields of view and does not require any external sensing devices. First, we apply motion to produce field of view overlaps and utilize a simple Unscented Kalman Filter to obtain vehicle poses. Then, we use the Gaussian mixture model-based registration framework GMMCalib to align the point clouds in a common calibration frame. Finally, we reduce the task of recovering the sensor extrinsics to a minimization problem. We show that both translational and rotational Sensor-to-Sensor errors can be solved accurately by our method. In addition, all Sensor-to-Vehicle rotation angles can also be calibrated with high accuracy. We validate the simulation results in real-world experiments. The code is open-source and available onthis https URL.

- **[Mag-Match: Magnetic Vector Field Features for Map Matching and Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15300)**  `arXiv:2508.15300`  `cs.RO`  
  _William McDonald, Cedric Le Gentil, Jennifer Wakulicz, Teresa Vidal-Calleja_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Map matching and registration are essential tasks in robotics for localisation and integration of multi-session or multi-robot data. Traditional methods rely on cameras or LiDARs to capture visual or geometric information but struggle in challenging conditions like smoke or dust. Magnetometers, on the other hand, detect magnetic fields, revealing features invisible to other sensors and remaining robust in such environments. In this paper, we introduce Mag-Match, a novel method for extracting and describing features in 3D magnetic vector field maps to register different maps of the same area. Our feature descriptor, based on higher-order derivatives of magnetic field maps, is invariant to global orientation, eliminating the need for gravity-aligned mapping. To obtain these higher-order derivatives map-wide given point-wise magnetometer data, we leverage a physics-informed Gaussian Process to perform efficient and recursive probabilistic inference of both the magnetic field and its derivatives. We evaluate Mag-Match in simulated and real-world experiments against a SIFT-based approach, demonstrating accurate map-to-map, robot-to-map, and robot-to-robot transformations - even without initial gravitational alignment.

- **[Distributed Detection of Adversarial Attacks in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Continuous Action Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15764)**  `arXiv:2508.15764`  `cs.LG` `cs.MA`  
  _Kiarash Kazari, Ezzeldin Shereen, Gy√∂rgy D√°n_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all evaluated environments.

- **[GRASPED: Graph Anomaly Detection using Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Decoder (Full Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15633)**  `arXiv:2508.15633`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Wei Herng Choong, Jixing Liu, Ching-Yu Kao, Philip Sperl_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However, they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters, thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

- **[Measures of Overlapping Multivariate Gaussian Clusters in Unsupervised Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15444)**  `arXiv:2508.15444`  `cs.LG`  
  _Miha O≈æbot, Igor ≈†krjanc_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged. Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

- **[Federated Learning based on Self-Evolving Gaussian Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15393)**  `arXiv:2508.15393`  `cs.LG`  
  _Miha O≈æbot, Igor ≈†krjanc_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori. Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI datasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition calculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in decentralized data processing.

- **[From Points to Spheres: A Geometric Reinterpretation of Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17255)**  `arXiv:2507.17255`  `cs.LG`  
  _Songxuan Shi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Variational Autoencoder is typically understood from the perspective of probabilistic inference. In this work, we propose a new geometric reinterpretation which complements the probabilistic view and enhances its intuitiveness. We demonstrate that the proper construction of semantic manifolds arises primarily from the constraining effect of the KL divergence on the encoder. We view the latent representations as a Gaussian ball rather than deterministic points. Under the constraint of KL divergence, Gaussian ball regularizes the latent space, promoting a more uniform distribution of encodings. Furthermore, we show that reparameterization establishes a critical contractual mechanism between the encoder and decoder, enabling the decoder to learn how to reconstruct from these stochastic regions. We further connect this viewpoint with VQ-VAE, offering a unified perspective: VQ-VAE can be seen as an autoencoder where encodings are constrained to a set of cluster centers, with its generative capability arising from the compactness rather than its stochasticity. This geometric framework provides a new lens for understanding how VAE shapes the latent geometry to enable effective generation.

- **[Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation via Probabilistic Gaussian Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15568)**  `arXiv:2508.15568`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Youjia Zhang, Youngeun Kim, Young-Geun Choi, Hongyeob Kim, Huiling Liu, Sungeun Hong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability. First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.

- **[TextSplat: Text-Guided Semantic Fusion for Generalizable Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09588)**  `arXiv:2504.09588`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhicong Wu, Hongbin Xu, Gang Xu, Ping Nie, Zhixin Yan, Jinkai Zheng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Generalizable Gaussian Splatting have enabled robust 3D reconstruction from sparse input views by utilizing feed-forward Gaussian Splatting models, achieving superior cross-scene generalization. However, while many methods focus on geometric consistency, they often neglect the potential of text-driven guidance to enhance semantic understanding, which is crucial for accurately reconstructing fine-grained details in complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose TextSplat--the first text-driven Generalizable Gaussian Splatting framework. By employing a text-guided fusion of diverse semantic cues, our framework learns robust cross-modal feature representations that improve the alignment of geometric and semantic information, producing high-fidelity 3D reconstructions. Specifically, our framework employs three parallel modules to obtain complementary representations: the Diffusion Prior Depth Estimator for accurate depth information, the Semantic Aware Segmentation Network for detailed semantic information, and the Multi-View Interaction Network for refined cross-view features. Then, in the Text-Guided Semantic Fusion Module, these representations are integrated via the text-guided and attention-based feature aggregation mechanism, resulting in enhanced 3D Gaussian parameters enriched with detailed semantic cues. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework. The code will be publicly available.

- **[High-Frequency First: A Two-Stage Approach for Improving Image INR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15582)**  `arXiv:2508.15582`  `cs.CV`  
  _Sumit Kumar Dam, Mrityunjoy Gain, Eui-Nam Huh, Choong Seon Hong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations, encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR, our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

- **[ExtraGS: Geometric-Aware Trajectory Extrapolation with Uncertainty-Guided Generative Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15529)**  `arXiv:2508.15529`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kaiyuan Tan, Yingying Shen, Haohui Zhu, Zhiwei Zhan, Shan Zhao, Mingfei Tu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG) representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF) design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups, and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving high fidelity along the original trajectory.

  _Fulden Ece Uƒüur, Rafael Redondo, Albert Barreiro, Stefan Hristov, Roger Mar√≠_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints, improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

- **[Enhancing Novel View Synthesis from extremely sparse views with SfM-free 3D Gaussian Splatting Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15457)**  `arXiv:2508.15457`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zongqi He, Hanmin Li, Kin-Chung Chan, Yushen Zuo, Hao Xie, Zhe Xiao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse, the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes, resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs 3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches, achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details, resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

  _Wenrui Li, Wei Han, Liang-Jian Deng, Ruiqin Xiong, Xiaopeng Fan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However, existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes and pre-trained models are available atthis https URL.

- **[DriveSplat: Decoupled Driving Scene Reconstruction with Geometry-enhanced Partitioned Neural Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15376)**  `arXiv:2508.15376`  `cs.CV`  
  _Cong Wang, Xianda Guo, Wenbo Xu, Wei Tian, Ruiqi Song, Chenming Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles, pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near, middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation. Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors, whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network. The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

  Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience. Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball, in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field, as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon request at:this https URL

- **[MeSS: City Mesh-Guided Outdoor Scene Generation with Cross-View Consistent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15169)**  `arXiv:2508.15169`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xuyang Chen, Zhijun Zhai, Kaixuan Zhou, Zengmao Wang, Jianan He, Dong Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however, the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS (Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure) using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid advancement and widespread adoption of VR/AR technologies, there is a growing demand for the creation of high-quality, immersive dynamic scenes. However, existing generation works predominantly concentrate on the creation of static scenes or narrow perspective-view dynamic scenes, falling short of delivering a truly 360-degree immersive experience from any viewpoint. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TiP4GEN}, an advanced text-to-dynamic panorama scene generation framework that enables fine-grained content control and synthesizes motion-rich, geometry-consistent panoramic 4D scenes. TiP4GEN integrates panorama video generation and dynamic scene reconstruction to create 360-degree immersive virtual environments. For video generation, we introduce a \textbf{Dual-branch Generation Model} consisting of a panorama branch and a perspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation, respectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates comprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene reconstruction, we propose a \textbf{Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model} based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using metric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our method ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs and the superiority of TiP4GEN in generating visually compelling and motion-coherent dynamic panoramic scenes.

  _Nicolas Mastropasqua, Ignacio Bugueno-Cordova, Rodrigo Verschae, Daniel Acevedo, Pablo Negri, Maria E. Buemi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Micro-expression analysis has applications in domains such as Human-Robot Interaction and Driver Monitoring Systems. Accurately capturing subtle and fast facial movements remains difficult when relying solely on RGB cameras, due to limitations in temporal resolution and sensitivity to motion blur. Event cameras offer an alternative, with microsecond-level precision, high dynamic range, and low latency. However, public datasets featuring event-based recordings of Action Units are still scarce. In this work, we introduce a novel, preliminary multi-resolution and multi-modal micro-expression dataset recorded with synchronized RGB and event cameras under variable lighting conditions. Two baseline tasks are evaluated to explore the spatial-temporal dynamics of micro-expressions: Action Unit classification using Spiking Neural Networks (51.23\% accuracy with events vs. 23.12\% with RGB), and frame reconstruction using Conditional Variational Autoencoders, achieving SSIM = 0.8513 and PSNR = 26.89 dB with high-resolution event input. These promising results show that event-based data can be used for micro-expression recognition and frame reconstruction.

  Reinforcement learning for training end-to-end autonomous driving models in closed-loop simulations is gaining growing attention. However, most simulation environments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a substantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some approaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic environments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation, these methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training data, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel trajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a framework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene reconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end autonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce ReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance modeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby reconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the sim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover more corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA), which adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego vehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in). Finally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue of training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple straight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves end-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning methods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio.

  Multi-object tracking, player identification, and pose estimation are fundamental components of sports analytics, essential for analyzing player movements, performance, and tactical strategies. However, existing datasets and methodologies primarily target mainstream team sports such as soccer and conventional 5-on-5 basketball, often overlooking scenarios involving fixed-camera setups commonly used at amateur levels, less mainstream sports, or datasets that explicitly incorporate pose annotations. In this paper, we propose the TrackID3x3 dataset, the first publicly available comprehensive dataset specifically designed for multi-player tracking, player identification, and pose estimation in 3x3 basketball scenarios. The dataset comprises three distinct subsets (Indoor fixed-camera, Outdoor fixed-camera, and Drone camera footage), capturing diverse full-court camera perspectives and environments. We also introduce the Track-ID task, a simplified variant of the game state reconstruction task that excludes field detection and focuses exclusively on fixed-camera scenarios. To evaluate performance, we propose a baseline algorithm called Track-ID algorithm, tailored to assess tracking and identification quality. Furthermore, our benchmark experiments, utilizing recent multi-object tracking algorithms (e.g., BoT-SORT-ReID) and top-down pose estimation methods (HRNet, RTMPose, and SwinPose), demonstrate robust results and highlight remaining challenges. Our dataset and evaluation benchmarks provide a solid foundation for advancing automated analytics in 3x3 basketball. Dataset and code will be available atthis https URL.

  We present 3DGS-LM, a new method that accelerates the reconstruction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by replacing its ADAM optimizer with a tailored Levenberg-Marquardt (LM). Existing methods reduce the optimization time by decreasing the number of Gaussians or by improving the implementation of the differentiable rasterizer. However, they still rely on the ADAM optimizer to fit Gaussian parameters of a scene in thousands of iterations, which can take up to an hour. To this end, we change the optimizer to LM that runs in conjunction with the 3DGS differentiable rasterizer. For efficient GPU parallization, we propose a caching data structure for intermediate gradients that allows us to efficiently calculate Jacobian-vector products in custom CUDA kernels. In every LM iteration, we calculate update directions from multiple image subsets using these kernels and combine them in a weighted mean. Overall, our method is 20% faster than the original 3DGS while obtaining the same reconstruction quality. Our optimization is also agnostic to other methods that acclerate 3DGS, thus enabling even faster speedups compared to vanilla 3DGS.
