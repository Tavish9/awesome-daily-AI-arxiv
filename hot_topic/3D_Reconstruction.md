- **[Object-Reconstruction-Aware Whole-body Control of Mobile Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04094)**  `arXiv:2509.04094`  `cs.RO`

  Object reconstruction and inspection tasks play a crucial role in various robotics applications. Identifying paths that reveal the most unknown areas of the object becomes paramount in this context, as it directly affects efficiency, and this problem is known as the view path planning problem. Current methods often use sampling-based path planning techniques, evaluating potential views along the path to enhance reconstruction performance. However, these methods are computationally expensive as they require evaluating several candidate views on the path. To this end, we propose a computationally efficient solution that relies on calculating a focus point in the most informative (unknown) region and having the robot maintain this point in the camera field of view along the path. We incorporated this strategy into the whole-body control of a mobile manipulator employing a visibility constraint without the need for an additional path planner. We conducted comprehensive and realistic simulations using a large dataset of 114 diverse objects of varying sizes from 57 categories to compare our method with a sampling-based planning strategy using Bayesian data analysis. Furthermore, we performed real-world experiments with an 8-DoF mobile manipulator to demonstrate the proposed method's performance in practice. Our results suggest that there is no significant difference in object coverage and entropy. In contrast, our method is approximately nine times faster than the baseline sampling-based method in terms of the average time the robot spends between views.

- **[Rethinking Layer-wise Gaussian Noise Injection: Bridging Implicit Objectives and Privacy Budget Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04232)**  `arXiv:2509.04232`  `cs.LG`  
  _Qifeng Tan, Shusen Yang, Xuebin Ren, Yikai Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms (LGM) enhance flexibility in differentially private deep learning by injecting noise into partitioned gradient vectors. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic noise allocation strategies, lacking a rigorous understanding of their theoretical grounding in connecting noise allocation to formal privacy-utility tradeoffs. In this paper, we present a unified analytical framework that systematically connects layer-wise noise injection strategies with their implicit optimization objectives and associated privacy budget allocations. Our analysis reveals that several existing approaches optimize ill-posed objectives -- either ignoring inter-layer signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) consistency or leading to inefficient use of the privacy budget. In response, we propose a SNR-Consistent noise allocation strategy that unifies both aspects, yielding a noise allocation scheme that achieves better signal preservation and more efficient privacy budget utilization. Extensive experiments in both centralized and federated learning settings demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing allocation strategies, achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs. Our framework not only offers diagnostic insights into prior methods but also provides theoretical guidance for designing adaptive and effective noise injection schemes in deep models.

- **[Rethinking the long-range dependency in Mamba/SSM and transformer models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04226)**  `arXiv:2509.04226`  `cs.LG`  
  _Cong Ma, Kayvan Najarian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-range dependency is one of the most desired properties of recent sequence models such as state-space models (particularly Mamba) and transformer models. New model architectures are being actively developed and benchmarked for prediction tasks requiring long-range dependency. However, the capability of modeling long-range dependencies of these models has not been investigated from a theoretical perspective, which hinders a systematic improvement on this aspect. In this work, we mathematically define long-range dependency using the derivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs and compare the capability of SSM and transformer models of modeling long-range dependency based on this definition. We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM decays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the exponential decay of memory function in RNN. But the attention mechanism used in transformers is more flexible and is not constrained to exponential decay, which could in theory perform better at modeling long-range dependency with sufficient training data, computing resources, and proper training. To combine the flexibility of long-range dependency of attention mechanism and computation efficiency of SSM, we propose a new formulation for hidden state update in SSM and prove its stability under a standard Gaussian distribution of the input data.

- **[Online Learning of Optimal Sequential Testing Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03707)**  `arXiv:2509.03707`  `cs.LG`  
  _Qiyuan Chen, Raed Al Kontar_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper studies an online learning problem that seeks optimal testing policies for a stream of subjects, each of whom can be evaluated through a sequence of candidate tests drawn from a common pool. We refer to this problem as the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test for a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only a subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial information. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem could be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In practice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects are tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can bias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic MDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ rate in episodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness. This elevated lower bound is then matched by an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm whose cumulative regret is $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for both discrete and Gaussian distributions. To highlight the consequence of missingness-dependent rewards in OTP, we study a variant called the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum Entropy Sampling Problem, where rewards are independent of missing data. This structure enables an iterative-elimination algorithm that achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, breaking the $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ lower bound for OTP. Numerical results confirm our theory in both settings. Overall, this work deepens the understanding of the exploration--exploitation trade-off under missing data and guides the design of efficient sequential testing policies.

- **[Graph Random Features for Scalable Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03691)**  `arXiv:2509.03691`  `cs.LG`  
  _Matthew Zhang, Jihao Andreas Lin, Adrian Weller, Richard E. Turner, Isaac Reid_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the application of graph random features (GRFs) - a recently introduced stochastic estimator of graph node kernels - to scalable Gaussian processes on discrete input spaces. We prove that (under mild assumptions) Bayesian inference with GRFs enjoys $O(N^{3/2})$ time complexity with respect to the number of nodes $N$, compared to $O(N^3)$ for exact kernels. Substantial wall-clock speedups and memory savings unlock Bayesian optimisation on graphs with over $10^6$ nodes on a single computer chip, whilst preserving competitive performance.

- **[Emergence of Quantised Representations Isolated to Anisotropic Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12070)**  `arXiv:2507.12070`  `cs.LG`  
  _George Bird_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a novel methodology for determining representational structure, which builds upon the existing Spotlight Resonance method. This new tool is used to gain insight into how discrete representations can emerge and organise in autoencoder models, through a controlled ablation study in which only the activation function is altered. Using this technique, the validity of whether function-driven symmetries can act as implicit inductive biases on representations is determined. Representations are found to tend to discretise when the activation functions are defined through a discrete algebraic permutation-equivariant symmetry. In contrast, they remain continuous under a continuous algebraic orthogonal-equivariant definition. This confirms the hypothesis that the symmetries of network primitives can carry unintended inductive biases, which produce task-independent artefactual structures in representations. The discrete symmetry of contemporary forms is shown to be a strong predictor for the production of discrete representations emerging from otherwise continuous distributions -- a quantisation effect. This motivates further reassessment of functional forms in common usage due to such unintended consequences. Moreover, this supports a general causal model for one mode in which discrete representations may form, and could constitute a prerequisite for downstream interpretability phenomena, including grandmother neurons, discrete coding schemes, general linear features and possibly Superposition. Hence, this tool and proposed mechanism for the influence of functional form on representations may provide insights into interpretability research. Finally, preliminary results indicate that quantisation of representations appears to correlate with a measurable increase in reconstruction error, reinforcing previous conjectures that this collapse can be detrimental.

- **[Integrating Intermediate Layer Optimization and Projected Gradient Descent for Solving Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20789)**  `arXiv:2505.20789`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Yang Zheng, Wen Li, Zhaoqiang Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inverse problems (IPs) involve reconstructing signals from noisy observations. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving IPs, achieving remarkable reconstruction performance. However, existing DM-based methods frequently encounter issues such as heavy computational demands and suboptimal convergence. In this work, building upon the idea of the recent work DMPlug, we propose two novel methods, DMILO and DMILO-PGD, to address these challenges. Our first method, DMILO, employs intermediate layer optimization (ILO) to alleviate the memory burden inherent in DMPlug. Additionally, by introducing sparse deviations, we expand the range of DMs, enabling the exploration of underlying signals that may lie outside the range of the diffusion model. We further propose DMILO-PGD, which integrates ILO with projected gradient descent (PGD), thereby reducing the risk of suboptimal convergence. We provide an intuitive theoretical analysis of our approaches under appropriate conditions and validate their superiority through extensive experiments on diverse image datasets, encompassing both linear and nonlinear IPs. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of DMILO and DMILO-PGD in addressing common challenges in DM-based IP solvers.

- **[Conditional Video Generation for High-Efficiency Video Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15269)**  `arXiv:2507.15269`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Fangqiu Yi, Jingyu Xu, Jiawei Shao, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Perceptual studies demonstrate that conditional diffusion models excel at reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction. Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task, where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr√©chet Video Distance (FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.

- **[Optimization of Module Transferability in Single Image Super-Resolution: Universality Assessment and Cycle Residual Blocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03522)**  `arXiv:2505.03522`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Haotong Cheng, Zhiqi Zhang, Hao Li, Xinshang Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning has substantially advanced the field of Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). However, existing research has predominantly focused on raw performance gains, with little attention paid to quantifying the transferability of architectural components. In this paper, we introduce the concept of "Universality" and its associated definitions, which extend the traditional notion of "Generalization" to encompass the ease of transferability of modules. We then propose the Universality Assessment Equation (UAE), a metric that quantifies how readily a given module can be transplanted across models and reveals the combined influence of multiple existing metrics on transferability. Guided by the UAE results of standard residual blocks and other plug-and-play modules, we further design two optimized modules: the Cycle Residual Block (CRB) and the Depth-Wise Cycle Residual Block (DCRB). Through comprehensive experiments on natural-scene benchmarks, remote-sensing datasets, and other low-level tasks, we demonstrate that networks embedded with the proposed plug-and-play modules outperform several state-of-the-art methods, achieving a PSNR improvement of up to 0.83 dB or enabling a 71.3% reduction in parameters with negligible loss in reconstruction fidelity. Similar optimization approaches could be applied to a broader range of basic modules, offering a new paradigm for the design of plug-and-play modules.

- **[Durian: Dual Reference-guided Portrait Animation with Attribute Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04434)**  `arXiv:2509.04434`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hyunsoo Cha, Byungjun Kim, Hanbyul Joo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations, despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a single generation pass without additional training.

- **[Learning neural representations for X-ray ptychography reconstruction with unknown probes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04402)**  `arXiv:2509.04402`  `cs.CV`  
  _Tingyou Li, Zixin Xu, Zirui Gao, Hanfei Yan, Xiaojing Huang, Jizhou Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable, physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems, making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

- **[PAOLI: Pose-free Articulated Object Learning from Sparse-view Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04276)**  `arXiv:2509.04276`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jianning Deng, Kartic Subr, Hakan Bilen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing approaches.

- **[TopoSculpt: Betti-Steered Topological Sculpting of 3D Fine-grained Tubular Shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03938)**  `arXiv:2509.03938`  `cs.CV`  
  _Minghui Zhang, Yaoyu Liu, Junyang Wu, Xin You, Hanxiao Zhang, Junjun He, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies. Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness. Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii) first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling of complex 3D tubular anatomy.

- **[LMVC: An End-to-End Learned Multiview Video Coding Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03922)**  `arXiv:2509.03922`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xihua Sheng, Yingwen Zhang, Long Xu, Shiqi Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive 3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding (LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research in this field.

- **[Weakly-Supervised Learning of Dense Functional Correspondences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03893)**  `arXiv:2509.03893`  `cs.CV`  
  _Stefan Stojanov, Linan Zhao, Yunzhi Zhang, Daniel L. K. Yamins, Jiajun Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task. The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

- **[Towards Efficient General Feature Prediction in Masked Skeleton Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03609)**  `arXiv:2509.03609`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shengkai Sun, Zefan Zhang, Jianfeng Dong, Zhiyong Cheng, Xiaojun Chang, Meng Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse. Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

- **[Sat-DN: Implicit Surface Reconstruction from Multi-View Satellite Images with Depth and Normal Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08352)**  `arXiv:2502.08352`  `cs.CV`  
  _Tianle Liu, Shuangming Zhao, Wanshou Jiang, Bingxuan Guo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With advancements in satellite imaging technology, acquiring high-resolution multi-view satellite imagery has become increasingly accessible, enabling rapid and location-independent ground model reconstruction. However, traditional stereo matching methods struggle to capture fine details, and while neural radiance fields (NeRFs) achieve high-quality reconstructions, their training time is prohibitively long. Moreover, challenges such as low visibility of building facades, illumination and style differences between pixels, and weakly textured regions in satellite imagery further make it hard to reconstruct reasonable terrain geometry and detailed building facades. To address these issues, we propose Sat-DN, a novel framework leveraging a progressively trained multi-resolution hash grid reconstruction architecture with explicit depth guidance and surface normal consistency constraints to enhance reconstruction quality. The multi-resolution hash grid accelerates training, while the progressive strategy incrementally increases the learning frequency, using coarse low-frequency geometry to guide the reconstruction of fine high-frequency details. The depth and normal constraints ensure a clear building outline and correct planar distribution. Extensive experiments on the DFC2019 dataset demonstrate that Sat-DN outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.
