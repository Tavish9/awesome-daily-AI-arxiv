- **[DECAMP: Towards Scene-Consistent Multi-Agent Motion Prediction with Disentangled Context-Aware Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10426)**  `arXiv:2509.10426`  `cs.RO` `cs.MA`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving, essential for ensuring both safety and efficiency on the road. However, traditional approaches often struggle with the scarcity of labeled data and exhibit suboptimal performance in multi-agent prediction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a disentangled context-aware pre-training framework for multi-agent motion prediction, named DECAMP. Unlike existing methods that entangle representation learning with pretext tasks, our framework decouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction, prioritizing interpretable dynamics and thereby enhancing scene representation for downstream prediction. Additionally, our framework incorporates context-aware representation learning alongside collaborative spatial-motion pretext tasks, which enables joint optimization of structural and intentional reasoning while capturing the underlying dynamic intentions. Our experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark showcase the superior performance of our method, and the results attained underscore its effectiveness in multi-agent motion forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first context autoencoder framework for multi-agent motion forecasting in autonomous driving. The code and models will be made publicly available.

  This paper presents a system for generating Gaussian path models from teaching data representing the path shape. In addition, methods for using these path models to classify human demonstrations of paths are introduced. By generating a library of multiple Gaussian path models of various shapes, human demonstrations can be used for intuitive robot motion programming. A method for modifying existing Gaussian path models by demonstration through geometric analysis is also presented.

  Understanding the internal organization of neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in deep learning interpretability. We address this challenge by exploring a novel Sparse Mixture of Experts Variational Autoencoder (SMoE-VAE) architecture. We test our model on the QuickDraw dataset, comparing unsupervised expert routing against a supervised baseline guided by ground-truth labels. Surprisingly, we find that unsupervised routing consistently achieves superior reconstruction performance. The experts learn to identify meaningful sub-categorical structures that often transcend human-defined class boundaries. Through t-SNE visualizations and reconstruction analysis, we investigate how MoE models uncover fundamental data structures that are more aligned with the model's objective than predefined labels. Furthermore, our study on the impact of dataset size provides insights into the trade-offs between data quantity and expert specialization, offering guidance for designing efficient MoE architectures.

- **[FedRP: A Communication-Efficient Approach for Differentially Private Federated Learning Using Random Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10041)**  `arXiv:2509.10041`  `cs.LG`  
  _Mohammad Hasan Narimani, Mostafa Tavassolipour_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning (FL) offers an innovative paradigm for collaborative model training across decentralized devices, such as smartphones, balancing enhanced predictive performance with the protection of user privacy in sensitive areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and medical data analysis. Despite its advantages, FL encounters significant challenges related to user privacy protection against potential attacks and the management of communication costs. This paper introduces a novel federated learning algorithm called FedRP, which integrates random projection techniques with the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) optimization framework. This approach enhances privacy by employing random projection to reduce the dimensionality of model parameters prior to their transmission to a central server, reducing the communication cost. The proposed algorithm offers a strong $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy guarantee, demonstrating resilience against data reconstruction attacks. Experimental results reveal that FedRP not only maintains high model accuracy but also outperforms existing methods, including conventional differential privacy approaches and FedADMM, in terms of both privacy preservation and communication efficiency.

- **[Sparse Coding Representation of 2-way Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10033)**  `arXiv:2509.10033`  `cs.LG`

  Sparse dictionary coding represents signals as linear combinations of a few dictionary atoms. It has been applied to images, time series, graph signals and multi-way spatio-temporal data by jointly employing temporal and spatial dictionaries. Data-agnostic analytical dictionaries, such as the discrete Fourier transform, wavelets and graph Fourier, have seen wide adoption due to efficient implementations and good practical performance. On the other hand, dictionaries learned from data offer sparser and more accurate solutions but require learning of both the dictionaries and the coding coefficients. This becomes especially challenging for multi-dictionary scenarios since encoding coefficients correspond to all atom combinations from the dictionaries. To address this challenge, we propose a low-rank coding model for 2-dictionary scenarios and study its data complexity. Namely, we establish a bound on the number of samples needed to learn dictionaries that generalize to unseen samples from the same distribution. We propose a convex relaxation solution, called AODL, whose exact solution we show also solves the original problem. We then solve this relaxation via alternating optimization between the sparse coding matrices and the learned dictionaries, which we prove to be convergent. We demonstrate its quality for data reconstruction and missing value imputation in both synthetic and real-world datasets. For a fixed reconstruction quality, AODL learns up to 90\% sparser solutions compared to non-low-rank and analytical (fixed) dictionary baselines. In addition, the learned dictionaries reveal interpretable insights into patterns present within the samples used for training.

- **[Realism Control One-step Diffusion for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10122)**  `arXiv:2509.10122`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Zongliang Wu, Siming Zheng, Peng-Tao Jiang, Xin Yuan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained diffusion models have shown great potential in real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) tasks by enabling high-resolution reconstructions. While one-step diffusion (OSD) methods significantly improve efficiency compared to traditional multi-step approaches, they still have limitations in balancing fidelity and realism across diverse scenarios. Since the OSDs for SR are usually trained or distilled by a single timestep, they lack flexible control mechanisms to adaptively prioritize these competing objectives, which are inherently manageable in multi-step methods through adjusting sampling steps. To address this challenge, we propose a Realism Controlled One-step Diffusion (RCOD) framework for Real-ISR. RCOD provides a latent domain grouping strategy that enables explicit control over fidelity-realism trade-offs during the noise prediction phase with minimal training paradigm modifications and original training data. A degradation-aware sampling strategy is also introduced to align distillation regularization with the grouping strategy and enhance the controlling of trade-offs. Moreover, a visual prompt injection module is used to replace conventional text prompts with degradation-aware visual tokens, enhancing both restoration accuracy and semantic consistency. Our method achieves superior fidelity and perceptual quality while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCOD outperforms state-of-the-art OSD methods in both quantitative metrics and visual qualities, with flexible realism control capabilities in the inference stage. The code will be released.

- **[An Autoencoder and Vision Transformer-based Interpretability Analysis of the Differences in Automated Staging of Second and Third Molars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09911)**  `arXiv:2509.09911`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The practical adoption of deep learning in high-stakes forensic applications, such as dental age estimation, is often limited by the 'black box' nature of the models. This study introduces a framework designed to enhance both performance and transparency in this context. We use a notable performance disparity in the automated staging of mandibular second (tooth 37) and third (tooth 38) molars as a case study. The proposed framework, which combines a convolutional autoencoder (AE) with a Vision Transformer (ViT), improves classification accuracy for both teeth over a baseline ViT, increasing from 0.712 to 0.815 for tooth 37 and from 0.462 to 0.543 for tooth 38. Beyond improving performance, the framework provides multi-faceted diagnostic insights. Analysis of the AE's latent space metrics and image reconstructions indicates that the remaining performance gap is data-centric, suggesting high intra-class morphological variability in the tooth 38 dataset is a primary limiting factor. This work highlights the insufficiency of relying on a single mode of interpretability, such as attention maps, which can appear anatomically plausible yet fail to identify underlying data issues. By offering a methodology that both enhances accuracy and provides evidence for why a model may be uncertain, this framework serves as a more robust tool to support expert decision-making in forensic age estimation.

- **[Compressed Video Quality Enhancement: Classifying and Benchmarking over Standards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10407)**  `arXiv:2509.10407`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Compressed video quality enhancement (CVQE) is crucial for improving user experience with lossy video codecs like H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, and H.266/VVC. While deep learning based CVQE has driven significant progress, existing surveys still suffer from limitations: lack of systematic classification linking methods to specific standards and artifacts, insufficient comparative analysis of architectural paradigms across coding types, and underdeveloped benchmarking practices. To address these gaps, this paper presents three key contributions. First, it introduces a novel taxonomy classifying CVQE methods across architectural paradigms, coding standards, and compressed-domain feature utilization. Second, it proposes a unified benchmarking framework integrating modern compression protocols and standard test sequences for fair multi-criteria evaluation. Third, it provides a systematic analysis of the critical trade-offs between reconstruction performance and computational complexity observed in state-of-the-art methods and highlighting promising directions for future research. This comprehensive review aims to establish a foundation for consistent assessment and informed model selection in CVQE research and deployment.

- **[GARD: Gamma-based Anatomical Restoration and Denoising for Retinal OCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10341)**  `arXiv:2509.10341`  `cs.CV`  
  _Botond Fazekas, Thomas Pinetz, Guilherme Aresta, Taha Emre, Hrvoje Bogunovic_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a vital imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring retinal diseases. However, OCT images are inherently degraded by speckle noise, which obscures fine details and hinders accurate interpretation. While numerous denoising methods exist, many struggle to balance noise reduction with the preservation of crucial anatomical structures. This paper introduces GARD (Gamma-based Anatomical Restoration and Denoising), a novel deep learning approach for OCT image despeckling that leverages the strengths of diffusion probabilistic models. Unlike conventional diffusion models that assume Gaussian noise, GARD employs a Denoising Diffusion Gamma Model to more accurately reflect the statistical properties of speckle. Furthermore, we introduce a Noise-Reduced Fidelity Term that utilizes a pre-processed, less-noisy image to guide the denoising process. This crucial addition prevents the reintroduction of high-frequency noise. We accelerate the inference process by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model framework to our Gamma-based model. Experiments on a dataset with paired noisy and less-noisy OCT B-scans demonstrate that GARD significantly outperforms traditional denoising methods and state-of-the-art deep learning models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and MSE. Qualitative results confirm that GARD produces sharper edges and better preserves fine anatomical details.

- **[On the Geometric Accuracy of Implicit and Primitive-based Representations Derived from View Rendering Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10241)**  `arXiv:2509.10241`  `cs.CV`  
  _Elias De Smijter, Renaud Detry, Christophe De Vleeschouwer_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present the first systematic comparison of implicit and explicit Novel View Synthesis methods for space-based 3D object reconstruction, evaluating the role of appearance embeddings. While embeddings improve photometric fidelity by modeling lighting variation, we show they do not translate into meaningful gains in geometric accuracy - a critical requirement for space robotics applications. Using the SPEED+ dataset, we compare K-Planes, Gaussian Splatting, and Convex Splatting, and demonstrate that embeddings primarily reduce the number of primitives needed for explicit methods rather than enhancing geometric fidelity. Moreover, convex splatting achieves more compact and clutter-free representations than Gaussian splatting, offering advantages for safety-critical applications such as interaction and collision avoidance. Our findings clarify the limits of appearance embeddings for geometry-centric tasks and highlight trade-offs between reconstruction quality and representation efficiency in space scenarios.

- **[Scalable Training for Vector-Quantized Networks with 100% Codebook Utilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10140)**  `arXiv:2509.10140`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yifan Chang, Jie Qin, Limeng Qiao, Xiaofeng Wang, Zheng Zhu, Lin Ma, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vector quantization (VQ) is a key component in discrete tokenizers for image generation, but its training is often unstable due to straight-through estimation bias, one-step-behind updates, and sparse codebook gradients, which lead to suboptimal reconstruction performance and low codebook usage. In this work, we analyze these fundamental challenges and provide a simple yet effective solution. To maintain high codebook usage in VQ networks (VQN) during learning annealing and codebook size expansion, we propose VQBridge, a robust, scalable, and efficient projector based on the map function method. VQBridge optimizes code vectors through a compress-process-recover pipeline, enabling stable and effective codebook training. By combining VQBridge with learning annealing, our VQN achieves full (100%) codebook usage across diverse codebook configurations, which we refer to as FVQ (FullVQ). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FVQ is effective, scalable, and generalizable: it attains 100% codebook usage even with a 262k-codebook, achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, consistently improves with larger codebooks, higher vector channels, or longer training, and remains effective across different VQ variants. Moreover, when integrated with LlamaGen, FVQ significantly enhances image generation performance, surpassing visual autoregressive models (VAR) by 0.5 and diffusion models (DiT) by 0.2 rFID, highlighting the importance of high-quality tokenizers for strong autoregressive image generation.

  Event camera sensors are bio-inspired sensors which asynchronously capture per-pixel brightness changes and output a stream of events encoding the polarity, location and time of these changes. These systems are witnessing rapid advancements as an emerging field, driven by their low latency, reduced power consumption, and ultra-high capture rates. This survey explores the evolution of fusing event-stream captured with traditional frame-based capture, highlighting how this synergy significantly benefits various video restoration and 3D reconstruction tasks. The paper systematically reviews major deep learning contributions to image/video enhancement and restoration, focusing on two dimensions: temporal enhancement (such as frame interpolation and motion deblurring) and spatial enhancement (including super-resolution, low-light and HDR enhancement, and artifact reduction). This paper also explores how the 3D reconstruction domain evolves with the advancement of event driven fusion. Diverse topics are covered, with in-depth discussions on recent works for improving visual quality under challenging conditions. Additionally, the survey compiles a comprehensive list of openly available datasets, enabling reproducible research and benchmarking. By consolidating recent progress and insights, this survey aims to inspire further research into leveraging event camera systems, especially in combination with deep learning, for advanced visual media restoration and enhancement.

- **[Dropping Experts, Recombining Neurons: Retraining-Free Pruning for Sparse Mixture-of-Experts LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10377)**  `arXiv:2509.10377`  `cs.CL`  
  _Yixiao Zhou, Ziyu Zhao, Dongzhou Cheng, zhiliang wu, Jie Gui, Yi Yang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures are widely used in large language models (LLMs) due to their computational efficiency. However, though only a few experts are activated for each token, SMoE still requires loading all expert parameters, leading to high memory usage and challenges in deployment. Previous work has tried to reduce the overhead by pruning and merging experts, but primarily focused on expert-level operations, leaving neuron-level structure underexplored. We propose DERN (Dropping Experts, Recombining Neurons), a task-agnostic and retraining-free framework for expert pruning and reconstruction. We observe that experts are often misaligned and contain semantic conflicts at the neuron level, which poses challenges for direct merging. To solve this, DERN works in three steps: it first prunes redundant experts using router statistics; then it decomposes them into neuron-level expert segments, assigning each segment to its most compatible retained expert; and finally, it merges segments within each retained expert to build a compact representation. Experiments on Mixtral, Qwen, and DeepSeek SMoE models show that DERN improves performance by more than 5% on commonsense reasoning and MMLU benchmarks under 50% expert sparsity, without extra training. It also greatly reduces the number of experts and memory usage, making SMoE LLMs easier to deploy in practice.
