- **[Accelerating the Evolution of Personalized Automated Lane Change through Lesson Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07543)**  `arXiv:2405.07543`  `cs.LG` `cs.RO`

  Personalization is crucial for the widespread adoption of advanced driver assistance system. To match up with each user's preference, the online evolution capability is a must. However, conventional evolution methods learn from naturalistic driving data, which requires a lot computing power and cannot be applied online. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a lesson learning approach: learning from driver's takeover interventions. By leveraging online takeover data, the driving zone is generated to ensure perceived safety using Gaussian discriminant analysis. Real-time corrections to trajectory planning rewards are enacted through apprenticeship learning. Guided by the objective of optimizing rewards within the constraints of the driving zone, this approach employs model predictive control for trajectory planning. This lesson learning framework is highlighted for its faster evolution capability, adeptness at experience accumulating, assurance of perceived safety, and computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system consistently achieves a successful customization without further takeover interventions. Accumulated experience yields a 24% enhancement in evolution efficiency. The average number of learning iterations is only 13.8. The average computation time is 0.08 seconds.

  Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven to be powerful tools for interpreting neural networks by decomposing hidden representations into disentangled, interpretable features via sparsity constraints. However, conventional SAEs are constrained by the fixed sparsity level chosen during training; meeting different sparsity requirements therefore demands separate models and increases the computational footprint during both training and evaluation. We introduce a novel training objective, \emph{HierarchicalTopK}, which trains a single SAE to optimise reconstructions across multiple sparsity levels simultaneously. Experiments with Gemma-2 2B demonstrate that our approach achieves Pareto-optimal trade-offs between sparsity and explained variance, outperforming traditional SAEs trained at individual sparsity levels. Further analysis shows that HierarchicalTopK preserves high interpretability scores even at higher sparsity. The proposed objective thus closes an important gap between flexibility and interpretability in SAE design.

- **[Bridging Source and Target Domains via Link Prediction for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24055)**  `arXiv:2505.24055`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great ability for node classification on graphs. However, the success of GNNs relies on abundant labeled data, while obtaining high-quality labels is costly and challenging, especially for newly emerging domains. Hence, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which trains a classifier on the labeled source graph and adapts it to the unlabeled target graph, is attracting increasing attention. Various approaches have been proposed to alleviate the distribution shift between the source and target graphs to facilitate the classifier adaptation. However, most of them simply adopt existing UDA techniques developed for independent and identically distributed data to gain domain-invariant node embeddings for graphs, which do not fully consider the graph structure and message-passing mechanism of GNNs during the adaptation and will fail when label distribution shift exists among domains. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework that adopts link prediction to connect nodes between source and target graphs, which can facilitate message-passing between the source and target graphs and augment the target nodes to have ``in-distribution'' neighborhoods with the source domain. This strategy modified the target graph on the input level to reduce its deviation from the source domain in the embedding space and is insensitive to disproportional label distributions across domains. To prevent the loss of discriminative information in the target graph, we further design a novel identity-preserving learning objective, which guides the learning of the edge insertion module together with reconstruction and adaptation losses. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

- **[The Gaussian Mixing Mechanism: Renyi Differential Privacy via Gaussian Sketches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24603)**  `arXiv:2505.24603`  `cs.LG`  
  _Omri Lev, Vishwak Srinivasan, Moshe Shenfeld, Katrina Ligett, Ayush Sekhari, Ashia C. Wilson_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Gaussian sketching, which consists of pre-multiplying the data with a random Gaussian matrix, is a widely used technique for multiple problems in data science and machine learning, with applications spanning computationally efficient optimization, coded computing, and federated learning. This operation also provides differential privacy guarantees due to its inherent randomness. In this work, we revisit this operation through the lens of Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP), providing a refined privacy analysis that yields significantly tighter bounds than prior results. We then demonstrate how this improved analysis leads to performance improvement in different linear regression settings, establishing theoretical utility guarantees. Empirically, our methods improve performance across multiple datasets and, in several cases, reduce runtime.

- **[Efficient Neural and Numerical Methods for High-Quality Online Speech Spectrogram Inversion via Gradient Theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24498)**  `arXiv:2505.24498`  `cs.LG`  
  _Andres Fernandez, Juan Azcarreta, Cagdas Bilen, Jesus Monge Alvarez_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent work in online speech spectrogram inversion effectively combines Deep Learning with the Gradient Theorem to predict phase derivatives directly from magnitudes. Then, phases are estimated from their derivatives via least squares, resulting in a high quality reconstruction. In this work, we introduce three innovations that drastically reduce computational cost, while maintaining high quality: Firstly, we introduce a novel neural network architecture with just 8k parameters, 30 times smaller than previous state of the art. Secondly, increasing latency by 1 hop size allows us to further halve the cost of the neural inference step. Thirdly, we we observe that the least squares problem features a tridiagonal matrix and propose a linear-complexity solver for the least squares step that leverages tridiagonality and positive-semidefiniteness, achieving a speedup of several orders of magnitude. We release samples online.

  The core of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is to learn the in-distribution (ID) representation, which is distinguishable from OOD samples. Previous work applied recognition-based methods to learn the ID features, which tend to learn shortcuts instead of comprehensive representations. In this work, we find surprisingly that simply using reconstruction-based methods could boost the performance of OOD detection significantly. We deeply explore the main contributors of OOD detection and find that reconstruction-based pretext tasks have the potential to provide a generally applicable and efficacious prior, which benefits the model in learning intrinsic data distributions of the ID dataset. Specifically, we take Masked Image Modeling as a pretext task for our OOD detection framework (MOOD). Without bells and whistles, MOOD outperforms previous SOTA of one-class OOD detection by 5.7%, multi-class OOD detection by 3.0%, and near-distribution OOD detection by 2.1%. It even defeats the 10-shot-per-class outlier exposure OOD detection, although we do not include any OOD samples for our detection. Codes are available atthis https URL.

- **[CCNETS: A Modular Causal Learning Framework for Pattern Recognition in Imbalanced Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04139)**  `arXiv:2401.04139`  `cs.LG`  
  _Hanbeot Park, Yunjeong Cho, Hoon-Hee Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Handling class imbalance remains a central challenge in machine learning, particularly in pattern recognition tasks where rare but critical events-such as fraudulent transactions or medical anomalies-must be identified accurately. Traditional generative models offer a potential remedy through data augmentation but often treat generation and classification as independent processes, leading to distribution mismatch and limited classifier benefit. To address these shortcomings, we propose Causal Cooperative Networks (CCNETS), a modular learning framework that integrates generation, inference, and reconstruction within a unified causal paradigm. CCNETS comprises three cooperative modules: an Explainer for latent feature abstraction, a Reasoner for label prediction, and a Producer for context-aware data generation. These components interact through a causal feedback loop, where classification results guide targeted sample synthesis. A key innovation, the Zoint mechanism, enables adaptive fusion of latent and observable features, enhancing semantic richness and enabling robust decision-making under uncertainty. We evaluate CCNETS on a real-world credit card fraud detection dataset with extreme imbalance (fraud cases < 0.2%). Across three experimental setups-including synthetic training, amplified generation, and direct classifier comparison-CCNETS outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher F1 scores, precision, and recall. Models trained on CCNETS-generated data also demonstrate superior generalization under limited data conditions. These results establish CCNETS as a scalable, interpretable, and hybrid soft computing framework. By causally aligning synthetic data with classifier objectives, CCNETS advances imbalanced pattern recognition and opens new directions for robust, modular learning in real-world applications.

- **[STAR-Net: An Interpretable Model-Aided Network for Remote Sensing Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24327)**  `arXiv:2505.24327`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Remote sensing image (RSI) denoising is an important topic in the field of remote sensing. Despite the impressive denoising performance of RSI denoising methods, most current deep learning-based approaches function as black boxes and lack integration with physical information models, leading to limited interpretability. Additionally, many methods may struggle with insufficient attention to non-local self-similarity in RSI and require tedious tuning of regularization parameters to achieve optimal performance, particularly in conventional iterative optimization approaches. In this paper, we first propose a novel RSI denoising method named sparse tensor-aided representation network (STAR-Net), which leverages a low-rank prior to effectively capture the non-local self-similarity within RSI. Furthermore, we extend STAR-Net to a sparse variant called STAR-Net-S to deal with the interference caused by non-Gaussian noise in original RSI for the purpose of improving robustness. Different from conventional iterative optimization, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-guided deep unrolling network, in which all regularization parameters can be automatically learned, thus inheriting the advantages of both model-based and deep learning-based approaches and successfully addressing the above-mentioned shortcomings. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR-Net and STAR-Net-S outperform state-of-the-art RSI denoising methods.

- **[IMTS is Worth Time $\times$ Channel Patches: Visual Masked Autoencoders for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22815)**  `arXiv:2505.22815`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Zhangyi Hu, Jiemin Wu, Hua Xu, Mingqian Liao, Ninghui Feng, Bo Gao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) forecasting is challenging due to the unaligned nature of multi-channel signals and the prevalence of extensive missing data. Existing methods struggle to capture reliable temporal patterns from such data due to significant missing values. While pre-trained foundation models show potential for addressing these challenges, they are typically designed for Regularly Sampled Time Series (RTS). Motivated by the visual Mask AutoEncoder's (MAE) powerful capability for modeling sparse multi-channel information and its success in RTS forecasting, we propose VIMTS, a framework adapting Visual MAE for IMTS forecasting. To mitigate the effect of missing values, VIMTS first processes IMTS along the timeline into feature patches at equal intervals. These patches are then complemented using learned cross-channel dependencies. Then it leverages visual MAE's capability in handling sparse multichannel data for patch reconstruction, followed by a coarse-to-fine technique to generate precise predictions from focused contexts. In addition, we integrate self-supervised learning for improved IMTS modeling by adapting the visual MAE to IMTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate VIMTS's superior performance and few-shot capability, advancing the application of visual foundation models in more general time series tasks. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Masked Autoencoders Are Effective Tokenizers for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03444)**  `arXiv:2502.03444`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Hao Chen, Yujin Han, Fangyi Chen, Xiang Li, Yidong Wang, Jindong Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in latent diffusion models have demonstrated their effectiveness for high-resolution image synthesis. However, the properties of the latent space from tokenizer for better learning and generation of diffusion models remain under-explored. Theoretically and empirically, we find that improved generation quality is closely tied to the latent distributions with better structure, such as the ones with fewer Gaussian Mixture modes and more discriminative features. Motivated by these insights, we propose MAETok, an autoencoder (AE) leveraging mask modeling to learn semantically rich latent space while maintaining reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments validate our analysis, demonstrating that the variational form of autoencoders is not necessary, and a discriminative latent space from AE alone enables state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet generation using only 128 tokens. MAETok achieves significant practical improvements, enabling a gFID of 1.69 with 76x faster training and 31x higher inference throughput for 512x512 generation. Our findings show that the structure of the latent space, rather than variational constraints, is crucial for effective diffusion models. Code and trained models are released.

- **[LTM3D: Bridging Token Spaces for Conditional 3D Generation with Auto-Regressive Diffusion Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24245)**  `arXiv:2505.24245`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present LTM3D, a Latent Token space Modeling framework for conditional 3D shape generation that integrates the strengths of diffusion and auto-regressive (AR) models. While diffusion-based methods effectively model continuous latent spaces and AR models excel at capturing inter-token dependencies, combining these paradigms for 3D shape generation remains a challenge. To address this, LTM3D features a Conditional Distribution Modeling backbone, leveraging a masked autoencoder and a diffusion model to enhance token dependency learning. Additionally, we introduce Prefix Learning, which aligns condition tokens with shape latent tokens during generation, improving flexibility across modalities. We further propose a Latent Token Reconstruction module with Reconstruction-Guided Sampling to reduce uncertainty and enhance structural fidelity in generated shapes. Our approach operates in token space, enabling support for multiple 3D representations, including signed distance fields, point clouds, meshes, and 3D Gaussian Splatting. Extensive experiments on image- and text-conditioned shape generation tasks demonstrate that LTM3D outperforms existing methods in prompt fidelity and structural accuracy while offering a generalizable framework for multi-modal, multi-representation 3D generation.

  _Yangyi Huang, Ye Yuan, Xueting Li, Jan Kautz, Umar Iqbal_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing methods for image-to-3D avatar generation struggle to produce highly detailed, animation-ready avatars suitable for real-world applications. We introduce AdaHuman, a novel framework that generates high-fidelity animatable 3D avatars from a single in-the-wild image. AdaHuman incorporates two key innovations: (1) A pose-conditioned 3D joint diffusion model that synthesizes consistent multi-view images in arbitrary poses alongside corresponding 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS) reconstruction at each diffusion step; (2) A compositional 3DGS refinement module that enhances the details of local body parts through image-to-image refinement and seamlessly integrates them using a novel crop-aware camera ray map, producing a cohesive detailed 3D avatar. These components allow AdaHuman to generate highly realistic standardized A-pose avatars with minimal self-occlusion, enabling rigging and animation with any input motion. Extensive evaluation on public benchmarks and in-the-wild images demonstrates that AdaHuman significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both avatar reconstruction and reposing. Code and models will be publicly available for research purposes.

- **[DreamDance: Animating Character Art via Inpainting Stable Gaussian Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24733)**  `arXiv:2505.24733`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jiaxu Zhang, Xianfang Zeng, Xin Chen, Wei Zuo, Gang Yu, Guosheng Lin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents DreamDance, a novel character art animation framework capable of producing stable, consistent character and scene motion conditioned on precise camera trajectories. To achieve this, we re-formulate the animation task as two inpainting-based steps: Camera-aware Scene Inpainting and Pose-aware Video Inpainting. The first step leverages a pre-trained image inpainting model to generate multi-view scene images from the reference art and optimizes a stable large-scale Gaussian field, which enables coarse background video rendering with camera trajectories. However, the rendered video is rough and only conveys scene motion. To resolve this, the second step trains a pose-aware video inpainting model that injects the dynamic character into the scene video while enhancing background quality. Specifically, this model is a DiT-based video generation model with a gating strategy that adaptively integrates the character's appearance and pose information into the base background video. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of DreamDance, producing high-quality and consistent character animations with remarkable camera dynamics.

- **[GARLIC: GAussian Representation LearnIng for spaCe partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24608)**  `arXiv:2505.24608`  `cs.CV`  
  _Panagiotis Rigas, Panagiotis Drivas, Charalambos Tzamos, Ioannis Chamodrakas, George Ioannakis, Leonidas J. Guibas, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce GARLIC (GAussian Representation LearnIng for spaCe partitioning), a novel indexing structure based on \(N\)-dimensional Gaussians for efficiently learning high-dimensional vector spaces. Our approach is inspired from Gaussian splatting techniques, typically used in 3D rendering, which we adapt for high-dimensional search and classification. We optimize Gaussian parameters using information-theoretic objectives that balance coverage, assignment confidence, and structural and semantic consistency. A key contribution is to progressively refine the representation through split and clone operations, handling hundreds of dimensions, thus handling varying data densities. GARLIC offers the fast building times of traditional space partitioning methods (e.g., under \(\sim5\) min build time for SIFT1M) while achieving \(\sim50\%\) Recall10@10 in low-candidate regimes. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate our method's consistency in (a) \(k\)-NN retrieval, outperforming methods, such as Faiss-IVF, in fast-recall by using about half their probes for the same Recall10@10 in Fashion-MNIST, and (b) in classification tasks, beating by \(\sim15\%\) accuracy other majority voting methods. Further, we show strong generalization capabilities, maintaining high accuracy even with downsampled training data: using just \(1\%\) of the training data returns \(\sim 45\%\) Recall@1, thus making GARLIC quite powerful for applications requiring both speed and accuracy.

- **[UniGeo: Taming Video Diffusion for Unified Consistent Geometry Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24521)**  `arXiv:2505.24521`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yang-Tian Sun, Xin Yu, Zehuan Huang, Yi-Hua Huang, Yuan-Chen Guo, Ziyi Yang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, methods leveraging diffusion model priors to assist monocular geometric estimation (e.g., depth and normal) have gained significant attention due to their strong generalization ability. However, most existing works focus on estimating geometric properties within the camera coordinate system of individual video frames, neglecting the inherent ability of diffusion models to determine inter-frame correspondence. In this work, we demonstrate that, through appropriate design and fine-tuning, the intrinsic consistency of video generation models can be effectively harnessed for consistent geometric estimation. Specifically, we 1) select geometric attributes in the global coordinate system that share the same correspondence with video frames as the prediction targets, 2) introduce a novel and efficient conditioning method by reusing positional encodings, and 3) enhance performance through joint training on multiple geometric attributes that share the same correspondence. Our results achieve superior performance in predicting global geometric attributes in videos and can be directly applied to reconstruction tasks. Even when trained solely on static video data, our approach exhibits the potential to generalize to dynamic video scenes.

- **[ACM-UNet: Adaptive Integration of CNNs and Mamba for Efficient Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24481)**  `arXiv:2505.24481`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jing Huang, Yongkang Zhao, Yuhan Li, Zhitao Dai, Cheng Chen, Qiying Lai_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections has become a prevailing paradigm in medical image segmentation due to its simplicity and effectiveness. While many recent works aim to improve this framework by designing more powerful encoders and decoders, employing advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction, Transformers or state space models (SSMs) such as Mamba for global context modeling, or hybrid combinations of both, these methods often struggle to fully utilize pretrained vision backbones (e.g., ResNet, ViT, VMamba) due to structural mismatches. To bridge this gap, we introduce ACM-UNet, a general-purpose segmentation framework that retains a simple UNet-like design while effectively incorporating pretrained CNNs and Mamba models through a lightweight adapter mechanism. This adapter resolves architectural incompatibilities and enables the model to harness the complementary strengths of CNNs and SSMs-namely, fine-grained local detail extraction and long-range dependency modeling. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical multi-scale wavelet transform module in the decoder to enhance feature fusion and reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and ACDC benchmarks demonstrate that ACM-UNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining computationally efficient. Notably, it reaches 85.12% Dice Score and 13.89mm HD95 on the Synapse dataset with 17.93G FLOPs, showcasing its effectiveness and scalability. Code is available at:this https URL.

- **[ZPressor: Bottleneck-Aware Compression for Scalable Feed-Forward 3DGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23734)**  `arXiv:2505.23734`  `cs.CV`  
  _Weijie Wang, Donny Y. Chen, Zeyu Zhang, Duochao Shi, Akide Liu, Bohan Zhuang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models have recently emerged as a promising solution for novel view synthesis, enabling one-pass inference without the need for per-scene 3DGS optimization. However, their scalability is fundamentally constrained by the limited capacity of their encoders, leading to degraded performance or excessive memory consumption as the number of input views increases. In this work, we analyze feed-forward 3DGS frameworks through the lens of the Information Bottleneck principle and introduce ZPressor, a lightweight architecture-agnostic module that enables efficient compression of multi-view inputs into a compact latent state $Z$ that retains essential scene information while discarding redundancy. Concretely, ZPressor enables existing feed-forward 3DGS models to scale to over 100 input views at 480P resolution on an 80GB GPU, by partitioning the views into anchor and support sets and using cross attention to compress the information from the support views into anchor views, forming the compressed latent state $Z$. We show that integrating ZPressor into several state-of-the-art feed-forward 3DGS models consistently improves performance under moderate input views and enhances robustness under dense view settings on two large-scale benchmarks DL3DV-10K and RealEstate10K. The video results, code and trained models are available on our project page:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object orientation understanding represents a fundamental challenge in visual perception critical for applications like robotic manipulation and augmented reality. Current vision-language benchmarks fail to isolate this capability, often conflating it with positional relationships and general scene understanding. We introduce DORI (Discriminative Orientation Reasoning Intelligence), a comprehensive benchmark establishing object orientation perception as a primary evaluation target. DORI assesses four dimensions of orientation comprehension: frontal alignment, rotational transformations, relative directional relationships, and canonical orientation understanding. Through carefully curated tasks from 11 datasets spanning 67 object categories across synthetic and real-world scenarios, DORI provides insights on how multi-modal systems understand object orientations. Our evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art vision-language models reveals critical limitations: even the best models achieve only 54.2% accuracy on coarse tasks and 33.0% on granular orientation judgments, with performance deteriorating for tasks requiring reference frame shifts or compound rotations. These findings demonstrate the need for dedicated orientation representation mechanisms, as models show systematic inability to perform precise angular estimations, track orientation changes across viewpoints, and understand compound rotations - suggesting limitations in their internal 3D spatial representations. As the first diagnostic framework specifically designed for orientation awareness in multimodal systems, DORI offers implications for improving robotic control, 3D scene reconstruction, and human-AI interaction in physical environments.

  _Shintaro Ito, Natsuki Takama, Koichi Ito, Hwann-Tzong Chen, Takafumi Aoki_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The use of multi-view images acquired by a 360-degree camera can reconstruct a 3D space with a wide area. There are 3D reconstruction methods from equirectangular images based on NeRF and 3DGS, as well as Novel View Synthesis (NVS) methods. On the other hand, it is necessary to overcome the large distortion caused by the projection model of a 360-degree camera when equirectangular images are used. In 3DGS-based methods, the large distortion of the 360-degree camera model generates extremely large 3D Gaussians, resulting in poor rendering accuracy. We propose ErpGS, which is Omnidirectional GS based on 3DGS to realize NVS addressing the problems. ErpGS introduce some rendering accuracy improvement techniques: geometric regularization, scale regularization, and distortion-aware weights and a mask to suppress the effects of obstacles in equirectangular images. Through experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that ErpGS can render novel view images more accurately than conventional methods.

- **[Towards Dynamic 3D Reconstruction of Hand-Instrument Interaction in Ophthalmic Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17677)**  `arXiv:2505.17677`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ming Hu, Zhengdi Yu, Feilong Tang, Kaiwen Chen, Yulong Li, Imran Razzak, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate 3D reconstruction of hands and instruments is critical for vision-based analysis of ophthalmic microsurgery, yet progress has been hampered by the lack of realistic, large-scale datasets and reliable annotation tools. In this work, we introduce OphNet-3D, the first extensive RGB-D dynamic 3D reconstruction dataset for ophthalmic surgery, comprising 41 sequences from 40 surgeons and totaling 7.1 million frames, with fine-grained annotations of 12 surgical phases, 10 instrument categories, dense MANO hand meshes, and full 6-DoF instrument poses. To scalably produce high-fidelity labels, we design a multi-stage automatic annotation pipeline that integrates multi-view data observation, data-driven motion prior with cross-view geometric consistency and biomechanical constraints, along with a combination of collision-aware interaction constraints for instrument interactions. Building upon OphNet-3D, we establish two challenging benchmarks-bimanual hand pose estimation and hand-instrument interaction reconstruction-and propose two dedicated architectures: H-Net for dual-hand mesh recovery and OH-Net for joint reconstruction of two-hand-two-instrument interactions. These models leverage a novel spatial reasoning module with weak-perspective camera modeling and collision-aware center-based representation. Both architectures outperform existing methods by substantial margins, achieving improvements of over 2mm in Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) and up to 23% in ADD-S metrics for hand and instrument reconstruction, respectively.

- **[REJEPA: A Novel Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture for Efficient Remote Sensing Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03169)**  `arXiv:2504.03169`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shabnam Choudhury, Yash Salunkhe, Sarthak Mehrotra, Biplab Banerjee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid expansion of remote sensing image archives demands the development of strong and efficient techniques for content-based image retrieval (RS-CBIR). This paper presents REJEPA (Retrieval with Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), an innovative self-supervised framework designed for unimodal RS-CBIR. REJEPA utilises spatially distributed context token encoding to forecast abstract representations of target tokens, effectively capturing high-level semantic features and eliminating unnecessary pixel-level details. In contrast to generative methods that focus on pixel reconstruction or contrastive techniques that depend on negative pairs, REJEPA functions within feature space, achieving a reduction in computational complexity of 40-60% when compared to pixel-reconstruction baselines like Masked Autoencoders (MAE). To guarantee strong and varied representations, REJEPA incorporates Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularisation (VICReg), which prevents encoder collapse by promoting feature diversity and reducing redundancy. The method demonstrates an estimated enhancement in retrieval accuracy of 5.1% on BEN-14K (S1), 7.4% on BEN-14K (S2), 6.0% on FMoW-RGB, and 10.1% on FMoW-Sentinel compared to prominent SSL techniques, including CSMAE-SESD, Mask-VLM, SatMAE, ScaleMAE, and SatMAE++, on extensive RS benchmarks BEN-14K (multispectral and SAR data), FMoW-RGB and FMoW-Sentinel.

  Generative diffusion models trained on large-scale datasets have achieved remarkable progress in image synthesis. In favor of their ability to supplement missing details and generate aesthetically pleasing contents, recent works have applied them to image deblurring via training an adapter on blurry-sharp image pairs to provide structural conditions for restoration. However, acquiring substantial amounts of realistic paired data is challenging and costly in real-world scenarios. On the other hand, relying solely on synthetic data often results in overfitting, leading to unsatisfactory performance when confronted with unseen blur patterns. To tackle this issue, we propose UID-Diff, a generative-diffusion-based model designed to enhance deblurring performance on unknown domains by decoupling structural features and blur patterns through joint training on three specially designed tasks. We employ two Q-Formers as structural features and blur patterns extractors separately. The features extracted by them will be used for the supervised deblurring task on synthetic data and the unsupervised blur-transfer task by leveraging unpaired blurred images from the target domain simultaneously. We further introduce a reconstruction task to make the structural features and blur patterns complementary. This blur-decoupled learning process enhances the generalization capabilities of UID-Diff when encountering unknown blur patterns. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UID-Diff outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in blur removal and structural preservation in various challenging scenarios.

  We introduce a novel 3D generation method for versatile and high-quality 3D asset creation. The cornerstone is a unified Structured LATent (SLAT) representation which allows decoding to different output formats, such as Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, and meshes. This is achieved by integrating a sparsely-populated 3D grid with dense multiview visual features extracted from a powerful vision foundation model, comprehensively capturing both structural (geometry) and textural (appearance) information while maintaining flexibility during decoding. We employ rectified flow transformers tailored for SLAT as our 3D generation models and train models with up to 2 billion parameters on a large 3D asset dataset of 500K diverse objects. Our model generates high-quality results with text or image conditions, significantly surpassing existing methods, including recent ones at similar scales. We showcase flexible output format selection and local 3D editing capabilities which were not offered by previous models. Code, model, and data will be released.

- **[dc-GAN: Dual-Conditioned GAN for Face Demorphing From a Single Morph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14494)**  `arXiv:2411.14494`  `cs.CV`

  A facial morph is an image strategically created by combining two face images pertaining to two distinct identities. The goal is to create a face image that can be matched to two different identities by a face matcher. Face demorphing inverts this process and attempts to recover the original images constituting a facial morph. Existing demorphing techniques have two major limitations: (a) they assume that some identities are common in the train and test sets; and (b) they are prone to the morph replication problem, where the outputs are merely replicates of the input morph. In this paper, we overcome these issues by proposing dc-GAN (dual-conditioned GAN), a novel demorphing method conditioned on the morph image as well as the embedding extracted from the image. Our method overcomes the morph replication problem and produces high-fidelity reconstructions of the constituent images. Moreover, the proposed method is highly generalizable and applicable to both reference-based and reference-free demorphing methods. Experiments were conducted using the AMSL, FRLL-Morphs, and MorDiff datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of the method.
