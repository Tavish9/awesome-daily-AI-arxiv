- **[Hierarchical Procedural Framework for Low-latency Robot-Assisted Hand-Object Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19531)**  `arXiv:2405.19531`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  Advances in robotics have been driving the development of human-robot interaction (HRI) technologies. However, accurately perceiving human actions and achieving adaptive control remains a challenge in facilitating seamless coordination between human and robotic movements. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical procedural framework to enable dynamic robot-assisted hand-object interaction (HOI). An open-loop hierarchy leverages the RGB-based 3D reconstruction of the human hand, based on which motion primitives have been designed to translate hand motions into robotic actions. The low-level coordination hierarchy fine-tunes the robot's action by using the continuously updated 3D hand models. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the hierarchical control architecture. The adaptive coordination between human and robot behavior has achieved a delay of $\leq 0.3$ seconds in the tele-interaction scenario. A case study of ring-wearing tasks indicates the potential application of this work in assistive technologies such as healthcare and manufacturing.

  Visual imitation learning is effective for robots to learn versatile tasks. However, many existing methods rely on behavior cloning with supervised historical trajectories, limiting their 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal awareness. Consequently, these methods struggle to capture the 3D structures and 4D spatiotemporal relationships necessary for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4), a novel visual imitation learning method that incorporates spatiotemporal awareness into diffusion-based policies. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on trajectory cloning, DP4 leverages a dynamic Gaussian world model to guide the learning of 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal perceptions from interactive environments. Our method constructs the current 3D scene from a single-view RGB-D observation and predicts the future 3D scene, optimizing trajectory generation by explicitly modeling both spatial and temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments across 17 simulation tasks with 173 variants and 3 real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that the 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4) outperforms baseline methods, improving the average simulation task success rate by 16.4% (Adroit), 14% (DexArt), and 6.45% (RLBench), and the average real-world robotic task success rate by 8.6%.

  This paper presents a framework for mapping underwater caves. Underwater caves are crucial for fresh water resource management, underwater archaeology, and hydrogeology. Mapping the cave's outline and dimensions, as well as creating photorealistic 3D maps, is critical for enabling a better understanding of this underwater domain. In this paper, we present the mapping of an underwater cave segment (the catacombs) of the Devil's Eye cave system at Ginnie Springs, FL. We utilized a set of inexpensive action cameras in conjunction with a dive computer to estimate the trajectories of the cameras together with a sparse point cloud. The resulting reconstructions are utilized to produce a one-dimensional retract of the cave passages in the form of the average trajectory together with the boundaries (top, bottom, left, and right). The use of the dive computer enables the observability of the z-dimension in addition to the roll and pitch in a visual/inertial framework (SVIn2). In addition, the keyframes generated by SVIn2 together with the estimated camera poses for select areas are used as input to a global optimization (bundle adjustment) framework -- COLMAP -- in order to produce a dense reconstruction of those areas. The same cave segment is manually surveyed using the MNemo V2 instrument, providing an additional set of measurements validating the proposed approach. It is worth noting that with the use of action cameras, the primary components of a cave map can be constructed. Furthermore, with the utilization of a global optimization framework guided by the results of VI-SLAM package SVIn2, photorealistic dense 3D representations of selected areas can be reconstructed.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents the first photo-realistic LiDAR-Inertial-Camera Gaussian Splatting SLAM system that simultaneously addresses visual quality, geometric accuracy, and real-time performance. The proposed method performs robust and accurate pose estimation within a continuous-time trajectory optimization framework, while incrementally reconstructing a 3D Gaussian map using camera and LiDAR data, all in real time. The resulting map enables high-quality, real-time novel view rendering of both RGB images and depth maps. To effectively address under-reconstruction in regions not covered by the LiDAR, we employ a lightweight zero-shot depth model that synergistically combines RGB appearance cues with sparse LiDAR measurements to generate dense depth maps. The depth completion enables reliable Gaussian initialization in LiDAR-blind areas, significantly improving system applicability for sparse LiDAR sensors. To enhance geometric accuracy, we use sparse but precise LiDAR depths to supervise Gaussian map optimization and accelerate it with carefully designed CUDA-accelerated strategies. Furthermore, we explore how the incrementally reconstructed Gaussian map can improve the robustness of odometry. By tightly incorporating photometric constraints from the Gaussian map into the continuous-time factor graph optimization, we demonstrate improved pose estimation under LiDAR degradation scenarios. We also showcase downstream applications via extending our elaborate system, including video frame interpolation and fast 3D mesh extraction. To support rigorous evaluation, we construct a dedicated LiDAR-Inertial-Camera dataset featuring ground-truth poses, depth maps, and extrapolated trajectories for assessing out-of-sequence novel view synthesis. Both the dataset and code will be made publicly available on project pagethis https URL.

- **[Hier-SLAM++: Neuro-Symbolic Semantic SLAM with a Hierarchically Categorical Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14931)**  `arXiv:2502.14931`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Hier-SLAM++, a comprehensive Neuro-Symbolic semantic 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method with both RGB-D and monocular input featuring an advanced hierarchical categorical representation, which enables accurate pose estimation as well as global 3D semantic mapping. The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making scene understanding particularly challenging and costly. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes both semantic and geometric information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as well as the 3D generative model. By utilizing the proposed hierarchical tree structure, semantic information is symbolically represented and learned in an end-to-end manner. We further introduce an advanced semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both Intra-level and Inter-level optimizations. Additionally, we propose an improved SLAM system to support both RGB-D and monocular inputs using a feed-forward model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first semantic monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM system, significantly reducing sensor requirements for 3D semantic understanding and broadening the applicability of semantic Gaussian SLAM system. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior or on-par performance with state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing storage and training time requirements.

- **[Addressing Imbalanced Domain-Incremental Learning through Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07100)**  `arXiv:2507.07100`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Lan Li, Da-Wei Zhou, Han-Jia Ye, De-Chuan Zhan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) focuses on continual learning in non-stationary environments, requiring models to adjust to evolving domains while preserving historical knowledge. DIL faces two critical challenges in the context of imbalanced data: intra-domain class imbalance and cross-domain class distribution shifts. These challenges significantly hinder model performance, as intra-domain imbalance leads to underfitting of few-shot classes, while cross-domain shifts require maintaining well-learned many-shot classes and transferring knowledge to improve few-shot class performance in old domains. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts (DCE) framework. DCE employs a frequency-aware expert group, where each expert is guided by specialized loss functions to learn features for specific frequency groups, effectively addressing intra-domain class imbalance. Subsequently, a dynamic expert selector is learned by synthesizing pseudo-features through balanced Gaussian sampling from historical class statistics. This mechanism navigates the trade-off between preserving many-shot knowledge of previous domains and leveraging new data to improve few-shot class performance in earlier tasks. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate DCE's state-of-the-art performance.

- **[Denoising Multi-Beta VAE: Representation Learning for Disentanglement and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06613)**  `arXiv:2507.06613`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Disentangled and interpretable latent representations in generative models typically come at the cost of generation quality. The $\beta$-VAE framework introduces a hyperparameter $\beta$ to balance disentanglement and reconstruction quality, where setting $\beta > 1$ introduces an information bottleneck that favors disentanglement over sharp, accurate reconstructions. To address this trade-off, we propose a novel generative modeling framework that leverages a range of $\beta$ values to learn multiple corresponding latent representations. First, we obtain a slew of representations by training a single variational autoencoder (VAE), with a new loss function that controls the information retained in each latent representation such that the higher $\beta$ value prioritize disentanglement over reconstruction fidelity. We then, introduce a non-linear diffusion model that smoothly transitions latent representations corresponding to different $\beta$ values. This model denoises towards less disentangled and more informative representations, ultimately leading to (almost) lossless representations, enabling sharp reconstructions. Furthermore, our model supports sample generation without input images, functioning as a standalone generative model. We evaluate our framework in terms of both disentanglement and generation quality. Additionally, we observe smooth transitions in the latent spaces with respect to changes in $\beta$, facilitating consistent manipulation of generated outputs.

  Allocation of personnel and material resources is highly sensible in the case of firefighter interventions. This allocation relies on simulations to experiment with various scenarios. The main objective of this allocation is the global optimization of the firefighters response. Data generation is then mandatory to study various scenarios In this study, we propose to compare different data generation methods. Methods such as Random Sampling, Tabular Variational Autoencoders, standard Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Probabilistic Models are examined to ascertain their efficacy in capturing the intricacies of firefighter interventions. Traditional evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the nuanced requirements of synthetic datasets for real-world scenarios. To address this gap, an evaluation of synthetic data quality is conducted using a combination of domain-specific metrics tailored to the firefighting domain and standard measures such as the Wasserstein distance. Domain-specific metrics include response time distribution, spatial-temporal distribution of interventions, and accidents representation. These metrics are designed to assess data variability, the preservation of fine and complex correlations and anomalies such as event with a very low occurrence, the conformity with the initial statistical distribution and the operational relevance of the synthetic data. The distribution has the particularity of being highly unbalanced, none of the variables following a Gaussian distribution, adding complexity to the data generation process.

- **[Diffusion-Driven Semantic Communication for Generative Models with Bandwidth Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18468)**  `arXiv:2407.18468`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  Diffusion models have been extensively utilized in AI-generated content (AIGC) in recent years, thanks to the superior generation capabilities. Combining with semantic communications, diffusion models are used for tasks such as denoising, data reconstruction, and content generation. However, existing diffusion-based generative models do not consider the stringent bandwidth limitation, which limits its application in wireless communication. This paper introduces a diffusion-driven semantic communication framework with advanced VAE-based compression for bandwidth-constrained generative model. Our designed architecture utilizes the diffusion model, where the signal transmission process through the wireless channel acts as the forward process in diffusion. To reduce bandwidth requirements, we incorporate a downsampling module and a paired upsampling module based on a variational auto-encoder with reparameterization at the receiver to ensure that the recovered features conform to the Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we derive the loss function for our proposed system and evaluate its performance through comprehensive experiments. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in pixel-level metrics such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and semantic metrics like learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). These enhancements are more profound regarding the compression rates and SNR compared to deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC). We release the code atthis https URL.

- **[Exact Evaluation of the Accuracy of Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems with Gaussian Data Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07008)**  `arXiv:2507.07008`  `cs.LG`  
  _Emile Pierret, Bruno Galerne_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Used as priors for Bayesian inverse problems, diffusion models have recently attracted considerable attention in the literature. Their flexibility and high variance enable them to generate multiple solutions for a given task, such as inpainting, super-resolution, and deblurring. However, several unresolved questions remain about how well they perform. In this article, we investigate the accuracy of these models when applied to a Gaussian data distribution for deblurring. Within this constrained context, we are able to precisely analyze the discrepancy between the theoretical resolution of inverse problems and their resolution obtained using diffusion models by computing the exact Wasserstein distance between the distribution of the diffusion model sampler and the ideal distribution of solutions to the inverse problem. Our findings allow for the comparison of different algorithms from the literature.

- **[Horizontal and Vertical Federated Causal Structure Learning via Higher-order Cumulants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06888)**  `arXiv:2507.06888`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated causal discovery aims to uncover the causal relationships between entities while protecting data privacy, which has significant importance and numerous applications in real-world scenarios. Existing federated causal structure learning methods primarily focus on horizontal federated settings. However, in practical situations, different clients may not necessarily contain data on the same variables. In a single client, the incomplete set of variables can easily lead to spurious causal relationships, thereby affecting the information transmitted to other clients. To address this issue, we comprehensively consider causal structure learning methods under both horizontal and vertical federated settings. We provide the identification theories and methods for learning causal structure in the horizontal and vertical federal setting via higher-order cumulants. Specifically, we first aggregate higher-order cumulant information from all participating clients to construct global cumulant estimates. These global estimates are then used for recursive source identification, ultimately yielding a global causal strength matrix. Our approach not only enables the reconstruction of causal graphs but also facilitates the estimation of causal strength coefficients. Our algorithm demonstrates superior performance in experiments conducted on both synthetic data and real-world data.

- **[Direct Regret Optimization in Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06529)**  `arXiv:2507.06529`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful paradigm for optimizing expensive black-box functions. Traditional BO methods typically rely on separate hand-crafted acquisition functions and surrogate models for the underlying function, and often operate in a myopic manner. In this paper, we propose a novel direct regret optimization approach that jointly learns the optimal model and non-myopic acquisition by distilling from a set of candidate models and acquisitions, and explicitly targets minimizing the multi-step regret. Our framework leverages an ensemble of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with varying hyperparameters to generate simulated BO trajectories, each guided by an acquisition function chosen from a pool of conventional choices, until a Bayesian early stop criterion is met. These simulated trajectories, capturing multi-step exploration strategies, are used to train an end-to-end decision transformer that directly learns to select next query points aimed at improving the ultimate objective. We further adopt a dense training--sparse learning paradigm: The decision transformer is trained offline with abundant simulated data sampled from ensemble GPs and acquisitions, while a limited number of real evaluations refine the GPs online. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world benchmarks suggest that our method consistently outperforms BO baselines, achieving lower simple regret and demonstrating more robust exploration in high-dimensional or noisy settings.

- **[An AI Approach for Learning the Spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07073)**  `arXiv:2507.07073`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yulin An, Enrique del Castillo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator is central in geometric deep learning tasks, capturing intrinsic properties of the shape of the object under consideration. The best established method for its estimation, from a triangulated mesh of the object, is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM), and computes the top k LB eigenvalues with a complexity of O(Nk), where N is the number of points. This can render the FEM method inefficient when repeatedly applied to databases of CAD mechanical parts, or in quality control applications where part metrology is acquired as large meshes and decisions about the quality of each part are needed quickly and frequently. As a solution to this problem, we present a geometric deep learning framework to predict the LB spectrum efficiently given the CAD mesh of a part, achieving significant computational savings without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating that the LB spectrum is learnable. The proposed Graph Neural Network architecture uses a rich set of part mesh features - including Gaussian curvature, mean curvature, and principal curvatures. In addition to our trained network, we make available, for repeatability, a large curated dataset of real-world mechanical CAD models derived from the publicly available ABC dataset used for training and testing. Experimental results show that our method reduces computation time of the LB spectrum by approximately 5 times over linear FEM while delivering competitive accuracy.

- **[A Probabilistic Approach to Uncertainty Quantification Leveraging 3D Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06269)**  `arXiv:2507.06269`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Rushil Desai, Frederik Warburg, Trevor Darrell, Marissa Ramirez de Chanlatte_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through forests, where precise surface geometry and awareness of fidelity surface geometric uncertainty are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as NeRF or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, SDFs define continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify local surface instability via Hessian-based metrics, enabling computationally efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry, providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency, establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction, simulation, and robotic decision-making.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts, such as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically produces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each model, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model interpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for Aligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single, unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g., vision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is enforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism, ensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given concept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages semantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically improves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than tripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared sparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar high-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of how different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring manual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned representation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided spatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal retrieval.

- **[Geo-Registration of Terrestrial LiDAR Point Clouds with Satellite Images without GNSS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05999)**  `arXiv:2507.05999`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Xinyu Wang, Muhammad Ibrahim, Haitian Wang, Atif Mansoor, Ajmal Mian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds presents significant challenges in GNSS signal denied urban areas with high-rise buildings and bridges. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that require pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection. However, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration and spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite images, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of city scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach employs a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and then extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as well as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is performed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied to the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve vertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI benchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the KITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard deviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a 55.3\% improvement over the original dataset. On the Perth dataset, which lacks GNSS information, our method achieved an average STD of 0.96~m compared to the GPS data extracted from Google Maps API. This corresponds to a 77.4\% improvement from the initial alignment. Our method also resulted in elevation correlation gains of 30.5\% on the KITTI dataset and 50.4\% on the Perth dataset.

  Building state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong captioning capabilities typically necessitates training on billions of high-quality image-text pairs, requiring millions of GPU hours. This paper introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models (image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure under $1,000 USD.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian splatting has become a prominent technique for representing and rendering complex 3D scenes, due to its high fidelity and speed advantages. However, the growing demand for large-scale models calls for effective compression to reduce memory and computation costs, especially on mobile and edge devices with limited resources. Existing compression methods effectively reduce 3D Gaussian parameters but often require extensive retraining or fine-tuning, lacking flexibility under varying compression constraints.In this paper, we introduce FlexGaussian, a flexible and cost-effective method that combines mixed-precision quantization with attribute-discriminative pruning for training-free 3D Gaussian compression. FlexGaussian eliminates the need for retraining and adapts easily to diverse compression targets. Evaluation results show that FlexGaussian achieves up to 96.4% compression while maintaining high rendering quality (<1 dB drop in PSNR), and is deployable on mobile devices. FlexGaussian delivers high compression ratios within seconds, being 1.7-2.1x faster than state-of-the-art training-free methods and 10-100x faster than training-involved approaches. The code is being prepared and will be released soon at:this https URL

  The visualization of volumetric medical data is crucial for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and improving surgical planning and education. Cinematic rendering techniques significantly enrich this process by providing high-quality visualizations that convey intricate anatomical details, thereby facilitating better understanding and decision-making in medical contexts. However, the high computing cost and low rendering speed limit the requirement of interactive visualization in practical applications. In this paper, we introduce ClipGS, an innovative Gaussian splatting framework with the clipping plane supported, for interactive cinematic visualization of volumetric medical data. To address the challenges posed by dynamic interactions, we propose a learnable truncation scheme that automatically adjusts the visibility of Gaussian primitives in response to the clipping plane. Besides, we also design an adaptive adjustment model to dynamically adjust the deformation of Gaussians and refine the rendering performance. We validate our method on five volumetric medical data (including CT and anatomical slice data), and reach an average 36.635 PSNR rendering quality with 156 FPS and 16.1 MB model size, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and efficiency.

  Visual object counting is a fundamental computer vision task underpinning numerous real-world applications, from cell counting in biomedicine to traffic and wildlife monitoring. However, existing methods struggle to handle the challenge of stacked 3D objects in which most objects are hidden by those above them. To address this important yet underexplored problem, we propose a novel 3D counting approach that decomposes the task into two complementary subproblems - estimating the 3D geometry of the object stack and the occupancy ratio from multi-view images. By combining geometric reconstruction and deep learning-based depth analysis, our method can accurately count identical objects within containers, even when they are irregularly stacked. We validate our 3D Counting pipeline on diverse real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets, which we will release publicly to facilitate further research.

  Photorealistic reconstruction of street scenes is essential for developing real-world simulators in autonomous driving. While recent methods based on 3D/4D Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated promising results, they still encounter challenges in complex street scenes due to the unpredictable motion of dynamic objects. Current methods typically decompose street scenes into static and dynamic objects, learning the Gaussians in either a supervised manner (e.g., w/ 3D bounding-box) or a self-supervised manner (e.g., w/o 3D bounding-box). However, these approaches do not effectively model the motions of dynamic objects (e.g., the motion speed of pedestrians is clearly different from that of vehicles), resulting in suboptimal scene decomposition. To address this, we propose Explicit Motion Decomposition (EMD), which models the motions of dynamic objects by introducing learnable motion embeddings to the Gaussians, enhancing the decomposition in street scenes. The proposed plug-and-play EMD module compensates for the lack of motion modeling in self-supervised street Gaussian splatting methods. We also introduce tailored training strategies to extend EMD to supervised approaches. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art novel view synthesis performance in self-supervised settings.

  Gaze estimation encounters generalization challenges when dealing with out-of-distribution data. To address this problem, recent methods use neural radiance fields (NeRF) to generate augmented data. However, existing methods based on NeRF are computationally expensive and lack facial details. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become the prevailing representation of neural fields. While 3DGS has been extensively examined in head avatars, it faces challenges with accurate gaze control and generalization across different subjects. In this work, we propose GazeGaussian, the first high-fidelity gaze redirection method that uses a two-stream 3DGS model to represent the face and eye regions separately. Leveraging the unstructured nature of 3DGS, we develop a novel representation of the eye for rigid eye rotation based on the target gaze direction. To enable synthesis generalization across various subjects, we integrate an expression-guided module to inject subject-specific information into the neural renderer. Comprehensive experiments show that GazeGaussian outperforms existing methods in rendering speed, gaze redirection accuracy, and facial synthesis across multiple datasets.

  Endoluminal endoscopic procedures are essential for diagnosing colorectal cancer and other severe conditions in the digestive tract, urogenital system, and airways. 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis from endoscopic images are promising tools for enhancing diagnosis. Moreover, integrating physiological deformations and interaction with the endoscope enables the development of simulation tools from real video data. However, constrained camera trajectories and view-dependent lighting create artifacts, leading to inaccurate or overfitted reconstructions. We present PR-ENDO, a novel 3D reconstruction framework leveraging the unique property of endoscopic imaging, where a single light source is closely aligned with the camera. Our method separates light effects from tissue properties. PR-ENDO enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting with a physically based relightable model. We boost the traditional light transport formulation with a specialized MLP capturing complex light-related effects while ensuring reduced artifacts and better generalization across novel views. PR-ENDO achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to baseline methods on both public and in-house datasets. Unlike existing approaches, PR-ENDO enables tissue modifications while preserving a physically accurate response to light, making it closer to real-world clinical use.

  We present ViTaM-D, a novel visual-tactile framework for reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction with distributed tactile sensing to enhance contact modeling. Existing methods, relying solely on visual inputs, often fail to capture occluded interactions and object deformation. To address this, we introduce DF-Field, a distributed force-aware contact representation leveraging kinetic and potential energy in hand-object interactions. ViTaM-D first reconstructs interactions using a visual network with contact constraint, then refines contact details through force-aware optimization, improving object deformation modeling. To evaluate deformable object reconstruction, we introduce the HOT dataset, featuring 600 hand-object interaction sequences in a high-precision simulation environment. Experiments on DexYCB and HOT datasets show that ViTaM-D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction accuracy for both rigid and deformable objects. DF-Field also proves more effective in refining hand poses and enhancing contact modeling than previous refinement methods. The code, models, and datasets are available atthis https URL.

  Monitoring space objects is crucial for space situational awareness, yet reconstructing 3D satellite models from ground-based telescope images is challenging due to atmospheric turbulence, long observation distances, limited viewpoints, and low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we propose a novel computational imaging framework that overcomes these obstacles by integrating a hybrid image pre-processing pipeline with a joint pose estimation and 3D reconstruction module based on controlled Gaussian Splatting (GS) and Branch-and-Bound (BnB) search. We validate our approach on both synthetic satellite datasets and on-sky observations of China's Tiangong Space Station and the International Space Station, achieving robust 3D reconstructions of low-Earth orbit satellites from ground-based data. Quantitative evaluations using SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and Chamfer Distance demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF-based approaches, and ablation studies confirm the critical role of each component. Our framework enables high-fidelity 3D satellite monitoring from Earth, offering a cost-effective alternative for space situational awareness. Project page:this https URL
