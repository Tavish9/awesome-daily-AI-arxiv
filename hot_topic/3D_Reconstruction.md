- **[SiLVR: Scalable Lidar-Visual Radiance Field Reconstruction with Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02657)**  `arXiv:2502.02657`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`  
  _Yifu Tao, Maurice Fallon_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a neural radiance field (NeRF) based large-scale reconstruction system that fuses lidar and vision data to generate high-quality reconstructions that are geometrically accurate and capture photorealistic texture. Our system adopts the state-of-the-art NeRF representation to incorporate lidar. Adding lidar data adds strong geometric constraints on the depth and surface normals, which is particularly useful when modelling uniform texture surfaces which contain ambiguous visual reconstruction cues. A key contribution of this work is a novel method to quantify the epistemic uncertainty of the lidar-visual NeRF reconstruction by estimating the spatial variance of each point location in the radiance field given the sensor observations from the cameras and lidar. This provides a principled approach to evaluate the contribution of each sensor modality to the final reconstruction. In this way, reconstructions that are uncertain (due to e.g. uniform visual texture, limited observation viewpoints, or little lidar coverage) can be identified and removed. Our system is integrated with a real-time lidar SLAM system which is used to bootstrap a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) reconstruction procedure. It also helps to properly constrain the overall metric scale which is essential for the lidar depth loss. The refined SLAM trajectory can then be divided into submaps using Spectral Clustering to group sets of co-visible images together. This submapping approach is more suitable for visual reconstruction than distance-based partitioning. Our uncertainty estimation is particularly effective when merging submaps as their boundaries often contain artefacts due to limited observations. We demonstrate the reconstruction system using a multi-camera, lidar sensor suite in experiments involving both robot-mounted and handheld scanning. Our test datasets cover a total area of more than 20,000 square metres.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advancing research in fields like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and autonomous navigation critically depends on reliable and reproducible multimodal datasets. While several influential datasets have driven progress in these domains, they often suffer from limitations in sensing modalities, environmental diversity, and the reproducibility of the underlying hardware setups. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SMapper, a novel open-hardware, multi-sensor platform designed explicitly for, though not limited to, SLAM research. The device integrates synchronized LiDAR, multi-camera, and inertial sensing, supported by a robust calibration and synchronization pipeline that ensures precise spatio-temporal alignment across modalities. Its open and replicable design allows researchers to extend its capabilities and reproduce experiments across both handheld and robot-mounted scenarios. To demonstrate its practicality, we additionally release SMapper-light, a publicly available SLAM dataset containing representative indoor and outdoor sequences. The dataset includes tightly synchronized multimodal data and ground-truth trajectories derived from offline LiDAR-based SLAM with sub-centimeter accuracy, alongside dense 3D reconstructions. Furthermore, the paper contains benchmarking results on state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM frameworks using the SMapper-light dataset. By combining open-hardware design, reproducible data collection, and comprehensive benchmarking, SMapper establishes a robust foundation for advancing SLAM algorithm development, evaluation, and reproducibility.

- **[Learning-Based Modeling of a Magnetically Steerable Soft Suction Device for Endoscopic Endonasal Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15155)**  `arXiv:2507.15155`  `cs.RO`  
  _Majid Roshanfar, Alex Zhang, Changyan He, Amir Hooshiar, Dale J. Podolsky, Thomas Looi, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This letter introduces a novel learning-based modeling framework for a magnetically steerable soft suction device designed for endoscopic endonasal brain tumor resection. The device is miniaturized (4 mm outer diameter, 2 mm inner diameter, 40 mm length), 3D printed using biocompatible SIL 30 material, and integrates embedded Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors for real-time shape feedback. Shape reconstruction is represented using four Bezier control points, enabling a compact and smooth model of the device's deformation. A data-driven model was trained on 5,097 experimental samples covering a range of magnetic field magnitudes (0-14 mT), actuation frequencies (0.2-1.0 Hz), and vertical tip distances (90-100 mm), using both Neural Network (NN) and Random Forest (RF) architectures. The RF model outperformed the NN across all metrics, achieving a mean root mean square error of 0.087 mm in control point prediction and a mean shape reconstruction error of 0.064 mm. Feature importance analysis further revealed that magnetic field components predominantly influence distal control points, while frequency and distance affect the base configuration. This learning-based approach effectively models the complex nonlinear behavior of hyperelastic soft robots under magnetic actuation without relying on simplified physical assumptions. By enabling sub-millimeter shape prediction accuracy and real-time inference, this work represents an advancement toward the intelligent control of magnetically actuated soft robotic tools in minimally invasive neurosurgery.

- **[Data Driven Discovery of Emergent Dynamics in Reaction Diffusion Systems from Sparse and Noisy Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09278)**  `arXiv:2509.09278`  `cs.LG` `cs.MA`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity, particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology, epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics. A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models, such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data. This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.

- **[Clip Your Sequences Fairly: Enforcing Length Fairness for Sequence-Level RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09177)**  `arXiv:2509.09177`  `cs.LG`  
  _Hanyi Mao, Quanjia Xiao, Lei Pang, Haixiao Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets.

- **[Active Learning and Explainable AI for Multi-Objective Optimization of Spin Coated Polymers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08988)**  `arXiv:2509.08988`  `cs.LG`  
  _Brendan Young, Brendan Alvey, Andreas Werbrouck, Will Murphy, James Keller, Mattias J. Young, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spin coating polymer thin films to achieve specific mechanical properties is inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. We present a framework that integrates an active Pareto front learning algorithm (PyePAL) with visualization and explainable AI techniques to optimize processing parameters. PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and elasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer mixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of the design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional design space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration. Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the learned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives into linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding of the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and linguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge discovery.

- **[The Oxford Spires Dataset: Benchmarking Large-Scale LiDAR-Visual Localisation, Reconstruction and Radiance Field Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10546)**  `arXiv:2411.10546`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Yifu Tao, Miguel √Ångel Mu√±oz-Ba√±√≥n, Lintong Zhang, Jiahao Wang, Lanke Frank Tarimo Fu, Maurice Fallon_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces a large-scale multi-modal dataset captured in and around well-known landmarks in Oxford using a custom-built multi-sensor perception unit as well as a millimetre-accurate map from a Terrestrial LiDAR Scanner (TLS). The perception unit includes three synchronised global shutter colour cameras, an automotive 3D LiDAR scanner, and an inertial sensor - all precisely calibrated. We also establish benchmarks for tasks involving localisation, reconstruction, and novel-view synthesis, which enable the evaluation of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) methods, Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-view Stereo (MVS) methods as well as radiance field methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting. To evaluate 3D reconstruction the TLS 3D models are used as ground truth. Localisation ground truth is computed by registering the mobile LiDAR scans to the TLS 3D models. Radiance field methods are evaluated not only with poses sampled from the input trajectory, but also from viewpoints that are from trajectories which are distant from the training poses. Our evaluation demonstrates a key limitation of state-of-the-art radiance field methods: we show that they tend to overfit to the training poses/images and do not generalise well to out-of-sequence poses. They also underperform in 3D reconstruction compared to MVS systems using the same visual inputs. Our dataset and benchmarks are intended to facilitate better integration of radiance field methods and SLAM systems. The raw and processed data, along with software for parsing and evaluation, can be accessed atthis https URL.

- **[Missing Fine Details in Images: Last Seen in High Frequencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05441)**  `arXiv:2509.05441`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Tejaswini Medi, Hsien-Yi Wang, Arianna Rampini, Margret Keuper_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been proposed to learn effective latent representations, generated images often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions, due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency information during optimization, leading to over-smoothed outputs and visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures while preserving global structure. Moreover, we integrate our frequency-preserving latent embeddings into a SOTA latent diffusion model, resulting in sharper and more realistic image generation. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware optimization for realistic image synthesis, with broader implications for applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

- **[MM-Prompt: Cross-Modal Prompt Tuning for Continual Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19455)**  `arXiv:2505.19455`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Xu Li, Fan Lyu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual Visual Question Answering (CVQA) based on pre-trained models(PTMs) has achieved promising progress by leveraging prompt tuning to enable continual multi-modal learning. However, most existing methods adopt cross-modal prompt isolation, constructing visual and textual prompts separately, which exacerbates modality imbalance and leads to degraded performance over time. To tackle this issue, we propose MM-Prompt, a novel framework incorporating cross-modal prompt query and cross-modal prompt recovery. The former enables balanced prompt selection by incorporating cross-modal signals during query formation, while the latter promotes joint prompt reconstruction through iterative cross-modal interactions, guided by an alignment loss to prevent representational drift. Extensive experiments show that MM-Prompt surpasses prior approaches in accuracy and knowledge retention, while maintaining balanced modality engagement throughout continual learning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale, diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes, camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses, depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video and 3D vision research community.

- **[Can Understanding and Generation Truly Benefit Together -- or Just Coexist?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09666)**  `arXiv:2509.09666`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhiyuan Yan, Kaiqing Lin, Zongjian Li, Junyan Ye, Hui Han, Zhendong Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE, a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation, where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

- **[FS-Diff: Semantic guidance and clarity-aware simultaneous multimodal image fusion and super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09427)**  `arXiv:2509.09427`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yuchan Jie, Yushen Xu, Xiaosong Li, Fuqiang Zhou, Jianming Lv, Huafeng Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions, the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted, with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images. Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics in the fused images. The code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Unsupervised Integrated-Circuit Defect Segmentation via Image-Intrinsic Normality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09375)**  `arXiv:2509.09375`  `cs.CV`  
  _Botong Zhao, Qijun Shi, Shujing Lyu, Yue Lu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training. Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product variability.

- **[Plug-and-play Diffusion Models for Image Compressive Sensing with Data Consistency Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09365)**  `arXiv:2509.09365`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xiaodong Wang, Ping Wang, Zhangyuan Li, Xin Yuan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

- **[ALL-PET: A Low-resource and Low-shot PET Foundation Model in the Projection Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09130)**  `arXiv:2509.09130`  `cs.CV`  
  _Bin Huang, Kang Chen, Bingxuan Li, Huafeng Liu, Qiegen Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource, low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain. ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations. First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over 200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments, ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

  _Chenqian Le, Yilin Zhao, Nikasadat Emami, Kushagra Yadav, Xujin "Chris" Liu, Xupeng Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in fMRI-based visual decoding have enabled compelling reconstructions of perceived images. However, most approaches rely on subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer integrates a Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) for efficient voxel compression and a query-driven Q-Former that produces fixed-size neural representations aligned with the CLIP image embedding space. Evaluated on the 7T Natural Scenes Dataset, VoxelFormer achieves competitive retrieval performance on subjects included during training with significantly fewer parameters than existing methods. These results highlight token merging and query-based transformers as promising strategies for parameter-efficient neural decoding.

- **[S$^2$-Guidance: Stochastic Self Guidance for Training-Free Enhancement of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12880)**  `arXiv:2508.12880`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chubin Chen, Jiashu Zhu, Xiaokun Feng, Nisha Huang, Meiqi Wu, Fangyuan Mao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique in modern diffusion models for enhancing sample quality and prompt adherence. However, through an empirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we observe a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the ground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions often leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this issue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on this insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic block-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks, effectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and toward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that S^2-Guidance delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and other advanced guidance strategies. Our code will be released.

- **[TESSER: Transfer-Enhancing Adversarial Attacks from Vision Transformers via Spectral and Semantic Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19613)**  `arXiv:2505.19613`  `cs.CV`  
  _Amira Guesmi, Bassem Ouni, Muhammad Shafique_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adversarial transferability remains a critical challenge in evaluating the robustness of deep neural networks. In security-critical applications, transferability enables black-box attacks without access to model internals, making it a key concern for real-world adversarial threat assessment. While Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong adversarial performance, existing attacks often fail to transfer effectively across architectures, especially from ViTs to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or hybrid models. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TESSER} -- a novel adversarial attack framework that enhances transferability via two key strategies: (1) \textit{Feature-Sensitive Gradient Scaling (FSGS)}, which modulates gradients based on token-wise importance derived from intermediate feature activations, and (2) \textit{Spectral Smoothness Regularization (SSR)}, which suppresses high-frequency noise in perturbations using a differentiable Gaussian prior. These components work in tandem to generate perturbations that are both semantically meaningful and spectrally smooth. Extensive experiments on ImageNet across 12 diverse architectures demonstrate that TESSER achieves +10.9\% higher attack succes rate (ASR) on CNNs and +7.2\% on ViTs compared to the state-of-the-art Adaptive Token Tuning (ATT) method. Moreover, TESSER significantly improves robustness against defended models, achieving 53.55\% ASR on adversarially trained CNNs. Qualitative analysis shows strong alignment between TESSER's perturbations and salient visual regions identified via Grad-CAM, while frequency-domain analysis reveals a 12\% reduction in high-frequency energy, confirming the effectiveness of spectral regularization.

- **[Total Disentanglement of Font Images into Style and Character Class Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12784)**  `arXiv:2403.12784`  `cs.CV`  
  _Daichi Haraguchi, Wataru Shimoda, Kota Yamaguchi, Seiichi Uchida_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we demonstrate a total disentanglement of font images. Total disentanglement is a neural network-based method for decomposing each font image nonlinearly and completely into its style and content (i.e., character class) features. It uses a simple but careful training procedure to extract the common style feature from all `A'-`Z' images in the same font and the common content feature from all `A' (or another class) images in different fonts. These disentangled features guarantee the reconstruction of the original font image. Various experiments have been conducted to understand the performance of total disentanglement. First, it is demonstrated that total disentanglement is achievable with very high accuracy; this is experimental proof of the long-standing open question, ``Does `A'-ness exist?'' Hofstadter (1985). Second, it is demonstrated that the disentangled features produced by total disentanglement apply to a variety of tasks, including font recognition, character recognition, and one-shot font image generation.

- **[CCF: A Context Compression Framework for Efficient Long-Sequence Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09199)**  `arXiv:2509.09199`  `cs.CL`  
  _Wenhao Li, Bangcheng Sun, Weihao Ye, Tianyi Zhang, Daohai Yu, Fei Chao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scaling language models to longer contexts is essential for capturing rich dependencies across extended discourse. However, na√Øve context extension imposes significant computational and memory burdens, often resulting in inefficiencies during both training and inference. In this work, we propose CCF, a novel context compression framework designed to enable efficient long-context modeling by learning hierarchical latent representations that preserve global semantics while aggressively reducing input redundancy. CCF integrates segment-wise semantic aggregation with key-value memory encoding, forming compact representations that support accurate reconstruction and long-range understanding. To further enhance scalability, we introduce a training-efficient optimization strategy that couples incremental segment decoding with sparse reservoir sampling, substantially reducing memory overhead without degrading performance. Empirical results on multiple long-context language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that CCF achieves competitive perplexity under high compression ratios, and significantly improves throughput and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches. These findings highlight the potential of structured compression for scalable and effective long-context language modeling.
