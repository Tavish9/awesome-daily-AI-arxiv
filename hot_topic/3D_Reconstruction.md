- **[A Robust Controller based on Gaussian Processes for Robotic Manipulators with Unknown Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11170)**  `arXiv:2507.11170`  `cs.RO`  
  _Giulio Giacomuzzo, Mohamed Abdelwahab, Marco Cal√¨, Alberto Dalla Libera, Ruggero Carli_

  In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based robust feedback linearization strategy to ensure precise trajectory tracking for an important family of Lagrangian systems. We assume a nominal knowledge of the dynamics is given but no a-priori bounds on the model mismatch are available. In our approach, the key ingredient is the adoption of a regression framework based on Gaussian Processes (GPR) to estimate the model mismatch. This estimate is added to the outer loop of a classical feedback linearization scheme based on the nominal knowledge available. Then, to compensate for the residual uncertainty, we robustify the controller including an additional term whose size is designed based on the variance provided by the GPR framework. We proved that, with high probability, the proposed scheme is able to guarantee asymptotic tracking of a desired trajectory. We tested numerically our strategy on a 2 degrees of freedom planar robot.

- **[Crafting Imperceptible On-Manifold Adversarial Attacks for Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10998)**  `arXiv:2507.10998`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhipeng He, Alexander Stevens, Chun Ouyang, Johannes De Smedt, Alistair Barros, Catarina Moreira_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adversarial attacks on tabular data present fundamental challenges distinct from image or text domains due to the heterogeneous nature of mixed categorical and numerical features. Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual similarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it difficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional gradient-based methods prioritise $\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing adversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions, making them detectable. We propose a latent space perturbation framework using a mixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate imperceptible adversarial examples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical features into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve statistical consistency. We specify In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to measure the proportion of adversarial examples that remain statistically indistinguishable from the input distribution. Evaluation across six publicly available datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method achieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance compared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted from image domain approaches. Our comprehensive analysis includes hyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control mechanisms, and generative architectural comparisons, revealing that VAE-based attacks depend critically on reconstruction quality but offer superior practical utility when sufficient training data is available. This work highlights the importance of on-manifold perturbations for realistic adversarial attacks on tabular data, offering a robust approach for practical deployment.

- **[Scalable Unsupervised Segmentation via Random Fourier Feature-based Gaussian Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10632)**  `arXiv:2507.10632`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Issei Saito, Masatoshi Nagano, Tomoaki Nakamura, Daichi Mochihashi, Koki Mimura_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose RFF-GP-HSMM, a fast unsupervised time-series segmentation method that incorporates random Fourier features (RFF) to address the high computational cost of the Gaussian process hidden semi-Markov model (GP-HSMM). GP-HSMM models time-series data using Gaussian processes, requiring inversion of an N times N kernel matrix during training, where N is the number of data points. As the scale of the data increases, matrix inversion incurs a significant computational cost. To address this, the proposed method approximates the Gaussian process with linear regression using RFF, preserving expressive power while eliminating the need for inversion of the kernel matrix. Experiments on the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) motion-capture dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves segmentation performance comparable to that of conventional methods, with approximately 278 times faster segmentation on time-series data comprising 39,200 frames.

- **[EXPO: Stable Reinforcement Learning with Expressive Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07986)**  `arXiv:2507.07986`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Perry Dong, Qiyang Li, Dorsa Sadigh, Chelsea Finn_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution. The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

- **[Multi-View Node Pruning for Accurate Graph Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11737)**  `arXiv:2503.11737`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Jiseong Park, Hanjin Kim, Seojin Kim, Jueun Choi, Doheon Lee, Sung Ju Hwang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph pooling, which compresses a whole graph into a smaller coarsened graph, is an essential component of graph representation learning. To efficiently compress a given graph, graph pooling methods often drop their nodes with attention-based scoring with the task loss. However, this often results in simply removing nodes with lower degrees without consideration of their feature-level relevance to the given task. To fix this problem, we propose a Multi-View Pruning(MVP), a graph pruning method based on a multi-view framework and reconstruction loss. Given a graph, MVP first constructs multiple graphs for different views either by utilizing the predefined modalities or by randomly partitioning the input features, to consider the importance of each node in diverse perspectives. Then, it learns the score for each node by considering both the reconstruction and the task loss. MVP can be incorporated with any hierarchical pooling framework to score the nodes. We validate MVP on multiple benchmark datasets by coupling it with two graph pooling methods, and show that it significantly improves the performance of the base graph pooling method, outperforming all baselines. Further analysis shows that both the encoding of multiple views and the consideration of reconstruction loss are the key to the success of MVP, and that it indeed identifies nodes that are less important according to domain knowledge.

- **[SimAD: A Simple Dissimilarity-based Approach for Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11238)**  `arXiv:2405.11238`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhijie Zhong, Zhiwen Yu, Xing Xi, Yue Xu, Wenming Cao, Yiyuan Yang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the prevalence of reconstruction-based deep learning methods, time series anomaly detection remains a tremendous challenge. Existing approaches often struggle with limited temporal contexts, insufficient representation of normal patterns, and flawed evaluation metrics, all of which hinder their effectiveness in detecting anomalous behavior. To address these issues, we introduce a $\textbf{Sim}$ple dissimilarity-based approach for time series $\textbf{A}$nomaly $\textbf{D}$etection, referred to as $\textbf{SimAD}$. Specifically, SimAD first incorporates a patching-based feature extractor capable of processing extended temporal windows and employs the EmbedPatch encoder to fully integrate normal behavioral patterns. Second, we design an innovative ContrastFusion module in SimAD, which strengthens the robustness of anomaly detection by highlighting the distributional differences between normal and abnormal data. Third, we introduce two robust enhanced evaluation metrics, Unbiased Affiliation (UAff) and Normalized Affiliation (NAff), designed to overcome the limitations of existing metrics by providing better distinctiveness and semantic clarity. The reliability of these two metrics has been demonstrated by both theoretical and experimental analyses. Experiments conducted on seven diverse time series datasets clearly demonstrate SimAD's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative improvements of $\textbf{19.85%}$ on F1, $\textbf{4.44%}$ on Aff-F1, $\textbf{77.79%}$ on NAff-F1, and $\textbf{9.69%}$ on AUC on six multivariate datasets.

- **[Leveraging Advanced Machine Learning to Predict Turbulence Dynamics from Temperature Observations at an Experimental Prescribed Fire](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11012)**  `arXiv:2507.11012`  `cs.LG`  
  _Dipak Dulal, Joseph J. Charney, Michael R. Gallagher, Pitambar Acharya, Carmeliza Navasca, Nicholas S. Skowronski_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study explores the potential for predicting turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) from more readily acquired temperature data using temperature profiles and turbulence data collected concurrently at 10 Hz during a small experimental prescribed burn in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Machine learning models, including Deep Neural Networks, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting, and Gaussian Process Regressor, were employed to assess the potential to predict TKE from temperature perturbations and explore temporal and spatial dynamics of correlations. Data visualization and correlation analyses revealed patterns and relationships between thermocouple temperatures and TKE, providing insight into the underlying dynamics. More accurate predictions of TKE were achieved by employing various machine learning models despite a weak correlation between the predictors and the target variable. The results demonstrate significant success, particularly from regression models, in accurately predicting the TKE. The findings of this study demonstrate a novel numerical approach to identifying new relationships between temperature and airflow processes in and around the fire environment. These relationships can help refine our understanding of combustion environment processes and the coupling and decoupling of fire environment processes necessary for improving fire operations strategy and fire and smoke model predictions. The findings of this study additionally highlight the valuable role of machine learning techniques in analyzing the complex large datasets of the fire environments, showcasing their potential to advance fire research and management practices.

- **[ZClassifier: Temperature Tuning and Manifold Approximation via KL Divergence on Logit Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10638)**  `arXiv:2507.10638`  `cs.LG`  
  _Shim Soon Yong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a novel classification framework, ZClassifier, that replaces conventional deterministic logits with diagonal Gaussian-distributed logits. Our method simultaneously addresses temperature scaling and manifold approximation by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the predicted Gaussian distributions and a unit isotropic Gaussian. This unifies uncertainty calibration and latent control in a principled probabilistic manner, enabling a natural interpretation of class confidence and geometric consistency. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that ZClassifier improves over softmax classifiers in robustness, calibration, and latent separation. We also demonstrate its effectiveness for classifier-guided generation by interpreting logits as Gaussian semantic potentials.

- **[Gaussian Loss Smoothing Enables Certified Training with Tight Convex Relaxations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07095)**  `arXiv:2403.07095`  `cs.LG`  
  _Stefan Balauca, Mark Niklas M√ºller, Yuhao Mao, Maximilian Baader, Marc Fischer, Martin Vechev_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training neural networks with high certified accuracy against adversarial examples remains an open challenge despite significant efforts. While certification methods can effectively leverage tight convex relaxations for bound computation, in training, these methods, perhaps surprisingly, can perform worse than looser relaxations. Prior work hypothesized that this phenomenon is caused by the discontinuity, non-smoothness, and perturbation sensitivity of the loss surface induced by tighter relaxations. In this work, we theoretically show that applying Gaussian Loss Smoothing (GLS) on the loss surface can alleviate these issues. We confirm this empirically by instantiating GLS with two variants: a zeroth-order optimization algorithm, called PGPE, which allows training with non-differentiable relaxations, and a first-order optimization algorithm, called RGS, which requires gradients of the relaxation but is much more efficient than PGPE. Extensive experiments show that when combined with tight relaxations, these methods surpass state-of-the-art methods when training on the same network architecture for many settings. Our results clearly demonstrate the promise of Gaussian Loss Smoothing for training certifiably robust neural networks and pave a path towards leveraging tighter relaxations for certified training.

- **[Streaming 4D Visual Geometry Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11539)**  `arXiv:2507.11539`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Dong Zhuo, Wenzhao Zheng, Jiahe Guo, Yuqi Wu, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Perceiving and reconstructing 4D spatial-temporal geometry from videos is a fundamental yet challenging computer vision task. To facilitate interactive and real-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer that shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We explore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer architecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal causal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to enable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle real-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information while maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we propose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry grounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model supports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g., FlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments on various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model increases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive performance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.

- **[MMOne: Representing Multiple Modalities in One Scene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11129)**  `arXiv:2507.11129`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Zhifeng Gu, Bing Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans perceive the world through multimodal cues to understand and interact with the environment. Learning a scene representation for multiple modalities enhances comprehension of the physical world. However, modality conflicts, arising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two critical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address these challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple modalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional modalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality indicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality. Additionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate multi-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality differences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by disentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific components, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently enhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to additional modalities.

- **[PAN-Crafter: Learning Modality-Consistent Alignment for PAN-Sharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23367)**  `arXiv:2505.23367`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Jeonghyeok Do, Sungpyo Kim, Geunhyuk Youk, Jaehyup Lee, Munchurl Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  PAN-sharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with low-resolution multi-spectral (MS) images to generate high-resolution multi-spectral (HRMS) outputs. However, cross-modality misalignment -- caused by sensor placement, acquisition timing, and resolution disparity -- induces a fundamental challenge. Conventional deep learning methods assume perfect pixel-wise alignment and rely on per-pixel reconstruction losses, leading to spectral distortion, double edges, and blurring when misalignment is present. To address this, we propose PAN-Crafter, a modality-consistent alignment framework that explicitly mitigates the misalignment gap between PAN and MS modalities. At its core, Modality-Adaptive Reconstruction (MARs) enables a single network to jointly reconstruct HRMS and PAN images, leveraging PAN's high-frequency details as auxiliary self-supervision. Additionally, we introduce Cross-Modality Alignment-Aware Attention (CM3A), a novel mechanism that bidirectionally aligns MS texture to PAN structure and vice versa, enabling adaptive feature refinement across modalities. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PAN-Crafter outperforms the most recent state-of-the-art method in all metrics, even with 50.11$\times$ faster inference time and 0.63$\times$ the memory size. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong generalization performance on unseen satellite datasets, showing its robustness across different conditions.

- **[Advancing Depth Anything Model for Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation in Endoscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07723)**  `arXiv:2409.07723`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Depth estimation is a cornerstone of 3D reconstruction and plays a vital role in minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries. However, most current depth estimation networks rely on traditional convolutional neural networks, which are limited in their ability to capture global information. Foundation models offer a promising approach to enhance depth estimation, but those models currently available are primarily trained on natural images, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to endoscopic images. In this work, we introduce a novel fine-tuning strategy for the Depth Anything Model and integrate it with an intrinsic-based unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework. Our approach includes a low-rank adaptation technique based on random vectors, which improves the model's adaptability to different scales. Additionally, we propose a residual block built on depthwise separable convolution to compensate for the transformer's limited ability to capture local features. Our experimental results on the SCARED dataset and Hamlyn dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while minimizing the number of trainable parameters. Applying this method in minimally invasive endoscopic surgery can enhance surgeons' spatial awareness, thereby improving the precision and safety of the procedures.

- **[Towards Depth Foundation Model: Recent Trends in Vision-Based Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11540)**  `arXiv:2507.11540`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhen Xu, Hongyu Zhou, Sida Peng, Haotong Lin, Haoyu Guo, Jiahao Shao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision, crucial for applications such as 3D reconstruction, free-viewpoint rendering, robotics, autonomous driving, and AR/VR technologies. Traditional methods relying on hardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution, and environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising alternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to either the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific and small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models in other domains has inspired the development of "depth foundation models": deep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning architectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo, multi-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these models to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of large-scale datasets that can facilitate their development. By identifying key architectures and training strategies, we aim to highlight the path towards robust depth foundation models, offering insights into their future research and applications.

- **[HUG-VAS: A Hierarchical NURBS-Based Generative Model for Aortic Geometry Synthesis and Controllable Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11474)**  `arXiv:2507.11474`  `cs.CV`  
  _Pan Du, Mingqi Xu, Xiaozhi Zhu, Jian-xun Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate characterization of vascular geometry is essential for cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional statistical shape modeling (SSM) methods rely on linear assumptions, limiting their expressivity and scalability to complex topologies such as multi-branch vascular structures. We introduce HUG-VAS, a Hierarchical NURBS Generative model for Vascular geometry Synthesis, which integrates NURBS surface parameterization with diffusion-based generative modeling to synthesize realistic, fine-grained aortic geometries. Trained with 21 patient-specific samples, HUG-VAS generates anatomically faithful aortas with supra-aortic branches, yielding biomarker distributions that closely match those of the original dataset. HUG-VAS adopts a hierarchical architecture comprising a denoising diffusion model that generates centerlines and a guided diffusion model that synthesizes radial profiles conditioned on those centerlines, thereby capturing two layers of anatomical variability. Critically, the framework supports zero-shot conditional generation from image-derived priors, enabling practical applications such as interactive semi-automatic segmentation, robust reconstruction under degraded imaging conditions, and implantable device optimization. To our knowledge, HUG-VAS is the first SSM framework to bridge image-derived priors with generative shape modeling via a unified integration of NURBS parameterization and hierarchical diffusion processes.

- **[A Mixed-Primitive-based Gaussian Splatting Method for Surface Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11321)**  `arXiv:2507.11321`  `cs.CV`  
  _Haoxuan Qu, Yujun Cai, Hossein Rahmani, Ajay Kumar, Junsong Yuan, Jun Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has received a lot of attention in surface reconstruction. However, while 3D objects can be of complex and diverse shapes in the real world, existing GS-based methods only limitedly use a single type of splatting primitive (Gaussian ellipse or Gaussian ellipsoid) to represent object surfaces during their reconstruction. In this paper, we highlight that this can be insufficient for object surfaces to be represented in high quality. Thus, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, enables Gaussian Splatting to incorporate multiple types of (geometrical) primitives during its surface reconstruction process. Specifically, in our framework, we first propose a compositional splatting strategy, enabling the splatting and rendering of different types of primitives in the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. In addition, we also design our framework with a mixed-primitive-based initialization strategy and a vertex pruning mechanism to further promote its surface representation learning process to be well executed leveraging different types of primitives. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our framework and its accurate surface reconstruction performance.

- **[3D Magnetic Inverse Routine for Single-Segment Magnetic Field Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11293)**  `arXiv:2507.11293`  `cs.CV`  
  _J. Senthilnath, Chen Hao, F. C. Wellstood_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In semiconductor packaging, accurately recovering 3D information is crucial for non-destructive testing (NDT) to localize circuit defects. This paper presents a novel approach called the 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR), which leverages Magnetic Field Images (MFI) to retrieve the parameters for the 3D current flow of a single-segment. The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning (DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based constraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages: i) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\ell/z_o$), where $\ell$ is the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic sensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging spatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for the position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\ell$), current ($I$), and current flow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer then adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\ell$, $I$) to minimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The results demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information with high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction in semiconductor packaging. This method highlights the potential of combining DL and physics-driven optimization in practical applications.

- **[A Multi-View High-Resolution Foot-Ankle Complex Point Cloud Dataset During Gait for Occlusion-Robust 3D Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11037)**  `arXiv:2507.11037`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jie-Wen Li, Zi-Han Ye, Qingyuan Zhou, Jiayi Song, Ying He, Ben Fei, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The kinematics analysis of foot-ankle complex during gait is essential for advancing biomechanical research and clinical assessment. Collecting accurate surface geometry data from the foot and ankle during dynamic gait conditions is inherently challenging due to swing foot occlusions and viewing limitations. Thus, this paper introduces FootGait3D, a novel multi-view dataset of high-resolution ankle-foot surface point clouds captured during natural gait. Different from existing gait datasets that typically target whole-body or lower-limb motion, FootGait3D focuses specifically on the detailed modeling of the ankle-foot region, offering a finer granularity of motion data. To address this, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46 subjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system. Each frame includes a complete 5-view reconstruction of the foot and ankle (serving as ground truth) along with partial point clouds obtained from only four, three, or two views. This structured variation enables rigorous evaluation of 3D point cloud completion methods under varying occlusion levels and viewpoints. Our dataset is designed for shape completion tasks, facilitating the benchmarking of state-of-the-art single-modal (e.g., PointTr, SnowflakeNet, Anchorformer) and multi-modal (e.g., SVDFormer, PointSea, CSDN) completion networks on the challenge of recovering the full foot geometry from occluded inputs. FootGait3D has significant potential to advance research in biomechanics and multi-segment foot modeling, offering a valuable testbed for clinical gait analysis, prosthetic design, and robotics applications requiring detailed 3D models of the foot during motion. The dataset is now available atthis https URL.
