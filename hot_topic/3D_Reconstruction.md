- **[Triplane Grasping: Efficient 6-DoF Grasping with Single RGB Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15879)**  `arXiv:2410.15879`  `cs.RO`

  Reliable object grasping is one of the fundamental tasks in robotics. However, determining grasping pose based on single-image input has long been a challenge due to limited visual information and the complexity of real-world objects. In this paper, we propose Triplane Grasping, a fast grasping decision-making method that relies solely on a single RGB-only image as input. Triplane Grasping creates a hybrid Triplane-Gaussian 3D representation through a point decoder and a triplane decoder, which produce an efficient and high-quality reconstruction of the object to be grasped to meet real-time grasping requirements. We propose to use an end-to-end network to generate 6-DoF parallel-jaw grasp distributions directly from 3D points in the point cloud as potential grasp contacts and anchor the grasp pose in the observed data. Experiments on the OmniObject3D and GraspNet-1Billion datasets demonstrate that our method achieves rapid modeling and grasping pose decision-making for daily objects, and strong generalization capability.

  The use of guidance to steer sampling toward desired outcomes has been widely explored within diffusion models, especially in applications such as image and trajectory generation. However, incorporating guidance during training remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we introduce energy-guided flow matching, a novel approach that enhances the training of flow models and eliminates the need for guidance at inference time. We learn a conditional velocity field corresponding to the flow policy by approximating an energy-guided probability path as a Gaussian path. Learning guided trajectories is appealing for tasks where the target distribution is defined by a combination of data and an energy function, as in reinforcement learning. Diffusion-based policies have recently attracted attention for their expressive power and ability to capture multi-modal action distributions. Typically, these policies are optimized using weighted objectives or by back-propagating gradients through actions sampled by the policy. As an alternative, we propose FlowQ, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm based on energy-guided flow matching. Our method achieves competitive performance while the policy training time is constant in the number of flow sampling steps.

- **[Physics-informed Reduced Order Modeling of Time-dependent PDEs via Differentiable Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14595)**  `arXiv:2505.14595`  `cs.LG`  
  _Nima Hosseini Dashtbayaz, Hesam Salehipour, Adrian Butscher, Nigel Morris_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reduced-order modeling (ROM) of time-dependent and parameterized differential equations aims to accelerate the simulation of complex high-dimensional systems by learning a compact latent manifold representation that captures the characteristics of the solution fields and their time-dependent dynamics. Although high-fidelity numerical solvers generate the training datasets, they have thus far been excluded from the training process, causing the learned latent dynamics to drift away from the discretized governing physics. This mismatch often limits generalization and forecasting capabilities. In this work, we propose Physics-informed ROM ($\Phi$-ROM) by incorporating differentiable PDE solvers into the training procedure. Specifically, the latent space dynamics and its dependence on PDE parameters are shaped directly by the governing physics encoded in the solver, ensuring a strong correspondence between the full and reduced systems. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven ROMs and other physics-informed strategies by accurately generalizing to new dynamics arising from unseen parameters, enabling long-term forecasting beyond the training horizon, maintaining continuity in both time and space, and reducing the data cost. Furthermore, $\Phi$-ROM learns to recover and forecast the solution fields even when trained or evaluated with sparse and irregular observations of the fields, providing a flexible framework for field reconstruction and data assimilation. We demonstrate the framework's robustness across different PDE solvers and highlight its broad applicability by providing an open-source JAX implementation readily extensible to other PDE systems and differentiable solvers.

- **[Symmetry-Breaking Descent for Invariant Cost Functionals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13578)**  `arXiv:2505.13578`  `cs.LG`  
  _Mikhail Osipov_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the problem of reducing a task cost functional $W(S)$, defined over Sobolev-class signals $S$, when the cost is invariant under a global symmetry group $G \subset \mathrm{Diff}(M)$ and accessible only as a black-box. Such scenarios arise in machine learning, imaging, and inverse problems, where cost metrics reflect model outputs or performance scores but are non-differentiable and model-internal. We propose a variational method that exploits the symmetry structure to construct explicit, symmetry-breaking deformations of the input signal. A gauge field $\phi$, obtained by minimizing an auxiliary energy functional, induces a deformation $h = A_\phi[S]$ that generically lies transverse to the $G$-orbit of $S$. We prove that, under mild regularity, the cost $W$ strictly decreases along this direction -- either via Clarke subdifferential descent or by escaping locally flat plateaus. The exceptional set of degeneracies has zero Gaussian measure. Our approach requires no access to model gradients or labels and operates entirely at test time. It provides a principled tool for optimizing invariant cost functionals via Lie-algebraic variational flows, with applications to black-box models and symmetry-constrained tasks.

- **[Conditional Distribution Quantization in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07151)**  `arXiv:2502.07151`  `cs.LG`  
  _Blaise Delattre, Sylvain Delattre, Alexandre V√©rine, Alexandre Allauzen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conditional expectation \mathbb{E}(Y \mid X) often fails to capture the complexity of multimodal conditional distributions \mathcal{L}(Y \mid X). To address this, we propose using n-point conditional quantizations--functional mappings of X that are learnable via gradient descent--to approximate \mathcal{L}(Y \mid X). This approach adapts Competitive Learning Vector Quantization (CLVQ), tailored for conditional distributions. It goes beyond single-valued predictions by providing multiple representative points that better reflect multimodal structures. It enables the approximation of the true conditional law in the Wasserstein distance. The resulting framework is theoretically grounded and useful for uncertainty quantification and multimodal data generation tasks. For example, in computer vision inpainting tasks, multiple plausible reconstructions may exist for the same partially observed input image X. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

- **[HyperNet Fields: Efficiently Training Hypernetworks without Ground Truth by Learning Weight Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17040)**  `arXiv:2412.17040`  `cs.LG`  
  _Eric Hedlin, Munawar Hayat, Fatih Porikli, Kwang Moo Yi, Shweta Mahajan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To efficiently adapt large models or to train generative models of neural representations, Hypernetworks have drawn interest. While hypernetworks work well, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized weights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training problem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an entire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a method to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground truth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire trajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In other words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the convergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the entire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is that the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then match the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient to train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction from images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any per-sample ground truth.

  Resampling from a target measure whose density is unknown is a fundamental problem in mathematical statistics and machine learning. A setting that dominates the machine learning literature consists of learning a map from an easy-to-sample prior, such as the Gaussian distribution, to a target measure. Under this model, samples from the prior are pushed forward to generate a new sample on the target measure, which is often difficult to sample from directly. Of particular interest is the problem of generating a new sample that is proximate to or otherwise conditioned on a given input sample. In this paper, we propose a new model called mirror bridges to solve this problem of conditional resampling. Our key observation is that solving the Schr√∂dinger bridge problem between a distribution and itself provides a natural way to produce new samples from conditional distributions, giving in-distribution variations of an input data point. We demonstrate how to efficiently estimate the solution to this largely overlooked version of the Schr√∂dinger bridge problem, and we prove that under mild conditions, the difference between our estimate and the true Schr√∂dinger bridge can be controlled explicitly. We show that our proposed method leads to significant algorithmic simplifications over existing alternatives, in addition to providing control over in-distribution variation. Empirically, we demonstrate how these benefits can be leveraged to produce proximal samples in a number of application domains.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) are generative models showing competitive performance in various domains, including image synthesis and 3D point cloud generation. Sampling from pre-trained DPMs involves multiple neural function evaluations (NFEs) to transform Gaussian noise samples into images, resulting in higher computational costs compared to single-step generative models such as GANs or VAEs. Therefore, reducing the number of NFEs while preserving generation quality is crucial. To address this, we propose LD3, a lightweight framework designed to learn the optimal time discretization for sampling. LD3 can be combined with various samplers and consistently improves generation quality without having to retrain resource-intensive neural networks. We demonstrate analytically and empirically that LD3 improves sampling efficiency with much less computational overhead. We evaluate our method with extensive experiments on 7 pre-trained models, covering unconditional and conditional sampling in both pixel-space and latent-space DPMs. We achieve FIDs of 2.38 (10 NFE), and 2.27 (10 NFE) on unconditional CIFAR10 and AFHQv2 in 5-10 minutes of training. LD3 offers an efficient approach to sampling from pre-trained diffusion models. Code is available atthis https URL.

- **[3D Reconstruction from Sketches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14621)**  `arXiv:2505.14621`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Abhimanyu Talwar, Julien Laasri_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We consider the problem of reconstructing a 3D scene from multiple sketches. We propose a pipeline which involves (1) stitching together multiple sketches through use of correspondence points, (2) converting the stitched sketch into a realistic image using a CycleGAN, and (3) estimating that image's depth-map using a pre-trained convolutional neural network based architecture called MegaDepth. Our contribution includes constructing a dataset of image-sketch pairs, the images for which are from the Zurich Building Database, and sketches have been generated by us. We use this dataset to train a CycleGAN for our pipeline's second step. We end up with a stitching process that does not generalize well to real drawings, but the rest of the pipeline that creates a 3D reconstruction from a single sketch performs quite well on a wide variety of drawings.

- **[AppleGrowthVision: A large-scale stereo dataset for phenological analysis, fruit detection, and 3D reconstruction in apple orchards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14029)**  `arXiv:2505.14029`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning has transformed computer vision for precision agriculture, yet apple orchard monitoring remains limited by dataset constraints. The lack of diverse, realistic datasets and the difficulty of annotating dense, heterogeneous scenes. Existing datasets overlook different growth stages and stereo imagery, both essential for realistic 3D modeling of orchards and tasks like fruit localization, yield estimation, and structural analysis. To address these gaps, we present AppleGrowthVision, a large-scale dataset comprising two subsets. The first includes 9,317 high resolution stereo images collected from a farm in Brandenburg (Germany), covering six agriculturally validated growth stages over a full growth cycle. The second subset consists of 1,125 densely annotated images from the same farm in Brandenburg and one in Pillnitz (Germany), containing a total of 31,084 apple labels. AppleGrowthVision provides stereo-image data with agriculturally validated growth stages, enabling precise phenological analysis and 3D reconstructions. Extending MinneApple with our data improves YOLOv8 performance by 7.69 % in terms of F1-score, while adding it to MinneApple and MAD boosts Faster R-CNN F1-score by 31.06 %. Additionally, six BBCH stages were predicted with over 95 % accuracy using VGG16, ResNet152, DenseNet201, and MobileNetv2. AppleGrowthVision bridges the gap between agricultural science and computer vision, by enabling the development of robust models for fruit detection, growth modeling, and 3D analysis in precision agriculture. Future work includes improving annotation, enhancing 3D reconstruction, and extending multimodal analysis across all growth stages.

  While representation learning and generative modeling seek to understand visual data, unifying both domains remains unexplored. Recent Unified Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods have started to bridge the gap between both paradigms. However, they rely solely on semantic token reconstruction, which requires an external tokenizer during training -- introducing a significant overhead. In this work, we introduce Sorcen, a novel unified SSL framework, incorporating a synergic Contrastive-Reconstruction objective. Our Contrastive objective, "Echo Contrast", leverages the generative capabilities of Sorcen, eliminating the need for additional image crops or augmentations during training. Sorcen "generates" an echo sample in the semantic token space, forming the contrastive positive pair. Sorcen operates exclusively on precomputed tokens, eliminating the need for an online token transformation during training, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1k demonstrate that Sorcen outperforms the previous Unified SSL SoTA by 0.4%, 1.48 FID, 1.76%, and 1.53% on linear probing, unconditional image generation, few-shot learning, and transfer learning, respectively, while being 60.8% more efficient. Additionally, Sorcen surpasses previous single-crop MIM SoTA in linear probing and achieves SoTA performance in unconditional image generation, highlighting significant improvements and breakthroughs in Unified SSL models.

- **[Dynadiff: Single-stage Decoding of Images from Continuously Evolving fMRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14556)**  `arXiv:2505.14556`  `cs.CV`  
  _Marl√®ne Careil, Yohann Benchetrit, Jean-R√©mi King_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Brain-to-image decoding has been recently propelled by the progress in generative AI models and the availability of large ultra-high field functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). However, current approaches depend on complicated multi-stage pipelines and preprocessing steps that typically collapse the temporal dimension of brain recordings, thereby limiting time-resolved brain decoders. Here, we introduce Dynadiff (Dynamic Neural Activity Diffusion for Image Reconstruction), a new single-stage diffusion model designed for reconstructing images from dynamically evolving fMRI recordings. Our approach offers three main contributions. First, Dynadiff simplifies training as compared to existing approaches. Second, our model outperforms state-of-the-art models on time-resolved fMRI signals, especially on high-level semantic image reconstruction metrics, while remaining competitive on preprocessed fMRI data that collapse time. Third, this approach allows a precise characterization of the evolution of image representations in brain activity. Overall, this work lays the foundation for time-resolved brain-to-image decoding.

- **[Personalize Your Gaussian: Consistent 3D Scene Personalization from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14537)**  `arXiv:2505.14537`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yuxuan Wang, Xuanyu Yi, Qingshan Xu, Yuan Zhou, Long Chen, Hanwang Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personalizing 3D scenes from a single reference image enables intuitive user-guided editing, which requires achieving both multi-view consistency across perspectives and referential consistency with the input image. However, these goals are particularly challenging due to the viewpoint bias caused by the limited perspective provided in a single image. Lacking the mechanisms to effectively expand reference information beyond the original view, existing methods of image-conditioned 3DGS personalization often suffer from this viewpoint bias and struggle to produce consistent results. Therefore, in this paper, we present Consistent Personalization for 3D Gaussian Splatting (CP-GS), a framework that progressively propagates the single-view reference appearance to novel perspectives. In particular, CP-GS integrates pre-trained image-to-3D generation and iterative LoRA fine-tuning to extract and extend the reference appearance, and finally produces faithful multi-view guidance images and the personalized 3DGS outputs through a view-consistent generation process guided by geometric cues. Extensive experiments on real-world scenes show that our CP-GS effectively mitigates the viewpoint bias, achieving high-quality personalization that significantly outperforms existing methods. The code will be released atthis https URL.

  _Ruoxin Chen, Junwei Xi, Zhiyuan Yan, Ke-Yue Zhang, Shuang Wu, Jingyi Xie, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing detectors are often trained on biased datasets, leading to the possibility of overfitting on non-causal image attributes that are spuriously correlated with real/synthetic labels. While these biased features enhance performance on the training data, they result in substantial performance degradation when applied to unbiased datasets. One common solution is to perform dataset alignment through generative reconstruction, matching the semantic content between real and synthetic images. However, we revisit this approach and show that pixel-level alignment alone is insufficient. The reconstructed images still suffer from frequency-level misalignment, which can perpetuate spurious correlations. To illustrate, we observe that reconstruction models tend to restore the high-frequency details lost in real images (possibly due to JPEG compression), inadvertently creating a frequency-level misalignment, where synthetic images appear to have richer high-frequency content than real ones. This misalignment leads to models associating high-frequency features with synthetic labels, further reinforcing biased cues. To resolve this, we propose Dual Data Alignment (DDA), which aligns both the pixel and frequency domains. Moreover, we introduce two new test sets: DDA-COCO, containing DDA-aligned synthetic images for testing detector performance on the most aligned dataset, and EvalGEN, featuring the latest generative models for assessing detectors under new generative architectures such as visual auto-regressive generators. Finally, our extensive evaluations demonstrate that a detector trained exclusively on DDA-aligned MSCOCO could improve across 8 diverse benchmarks by a non-trivial margin, showing a +7.2% on in-the-wild benchmarks, highlighting the improved generalizability of unbiased detectors.

- **[Domain Adaptation for Multi-label Image Classification: a Discriminator-free Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14333)**  `arXiv:2505.14333`  `cs.CV`  
  _Inder Pal Singh, Enjie Ghorbel, Anis Kacem, Djamila Aouada_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces a discriminator-free adversarial-based approach termed DDA-MLIC for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in the context of Multi-Label Image Classification (MLIC). While recent efforts have explored adversarial-based UDA methods for MLIC, they typically include an additional discriminator subnet. Nevertheless, decoupling the classification and the discrimination tasks may harm their task-specific discriminative power. Herein, we address this challenge by presenting a novel adversarial critic directly derived from the task-specific classifier. Specifically, we employ a two-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to model both source and target predictions, distinguishing between two distinct clusters. Instead of using the traditional Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, our approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to estimate the parameters of each GMM component. Subsequently, the source and target GMM parameters are leveraged to formulate an adversarial loss using the Fr√©chet distance. The proposed framework is therefore not only fully differentiable but is also cost-effective as it avoids the expensive iterative process usually induced by the standard EM method. The proposed method is evaluated on several multi-label image datasets covering three different types of domain shift. The obtained results demonstrate that DDA-MLIC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision while requiring a lower number of parameters. The code is made publicly available atthis http URL.

  In this paper, we present a multi-label stereo matching method to simultaneously estimate the depth of the transparent objects and the occluded background in transparentthis http URLprevious methods that assume a unimodal distribution along the disparity dimension and formulate the matching as a single-label regression problem, we propose a multi-label regression formulation to estimate multiple depth values at the same pixel in transparent scenes. To resolve the multi-label regression problem, we introduce a pixel-wise multivariate Gaussian representation, where the mean vector encodes multiple depth values at the same pixel, and the covariance matrix determines whether a multi-label representation is necessary for a given pixel. The representation is iteratively predicted within a GRU framework. In each iteration, we first predict the update step for the mean parameters and then use both the update step and the updated mean parameters to estimate the covariance matrix. We also synthesize a dataset containing 10 scenes and 89 objects to validate the performance of transparent scene depth estimation. The experiments show that our method greatly improves the performance on transparent surfaces while preserving the background information for scene reconstruction. Code is available atthis https URL.

- **[MGStream: Motion-aware 3D Gaussian for Streamable Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13839)**  `arXiv:2505.13839`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhenyu Bao, Qing Li, Guibiao Liao, Zhongyuan Zhao, Kanglin Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention in streamable dynamic novel view synthesis (DNVS) for its photorealistic rendering capability and computational efficiency. Despite much progress in improving rendering quality and optimization strategies, 3DGS-based streamable dynamic scene reconstruction still suffers from flickering artifacts and storage inefficiency, and struggles to model the emerging objects. To tackle this, we introduce MGStream which employs the motion-related 3D Gaussians (3DGs) to reconstruct the dynamic and the vanilla 3DGs for the static. The motion-related 3DGs are implemented according to the motion mask and the clustering-based convex hull algorithm. The rigid deformation is applied to the motion-related 3DGs for modeling the dynamic, and the attention-based optimization on the motion-related 3DGs enables the reconstruction of the emerging objects. As the deformation and optimization are only conducted on the motion-related 3DGs, MGStream avoids flickering artifacts and improves the storage efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets N3DV and MeetRoom demonstrate that MGStream surpasses existing streaming 3DGS-based approaches in terms of rendering quality, training/storage efficiency and temporal consistency. Our code is available at:this https URL.

- **[Spectral-Spatial Self-Supervised Learning for Few-Shot Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12482)**  `arXiv:2505.12482`  `cs.CV`  
  _Wenchen Chen, Yanmei Zhang, Zhongwei Xiao, Jianping Chu, Xingbo Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Few-shot classification of hyperspectral images (HSI) faces the challenge of scarce labeled samples. Self-Supervised learning (SSL) and Few-Shot Learning (FSL) offer promising avenues to address this issue. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs and lack sufficient spectral prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a method, Spectral-Spatial Self-Supervised Learning for Few-Shot Hyperspectral Image Classification (S4L-FSC), aimed at improving the performance of few-shot HSI classification. Specifically, we first leverage heterogeneous datasets to pretrain a spatial feature extractor using a designed Rotation-Mirror Self-Supervised Learning (RM-SSL) method, combined with FSL. This approach enables the model to learn the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs using rotation and mirroring labels as supervisory signals, while acquiring transferable spatial meta-knowledge through few-shot learning. Subsequently, homogeneous datasets are utilized to pretrain a spectral feature extractor via a combination of FSL and Masked Reconstruction Self-Supervised Learning (MR-SSL). The model learns to reconstruct original spectral information from randomly masked spectral vectors, inferring spectral dependencies. In parallel, FSL guides the model to extract pixel-level discriminative features, thereby embedding rich spectral priors into the model. This spectral-spatial pretraining method, along with the integration of knowledge from heterogeneous and homogeneous sources, significantly enhances model performance. Extensive experiments on four HSI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed S4L-FSC approach for few-shot HSI classification.

  _Cheng Wang, Xinzhu Ma, Bin Wang, Shixiang Tang, Yuan Meng, Ping Jiang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recovering CAD models from point clouds, especially the sketch-extrusion process, can be seen as the process of rebuilding the topology and extrusion primitives. Previous methods utilize implicit fields for sketch representation, leading to shape reconstruction of curved edges. In this paper, we proposed a CAD reconstruction network that produces editable CAD models from input point clouds (Point2Primitive) by directly predicting every element of the extrusion primitives. Point2Primitive can directly detect and predict sketch curves (type and parameter) from point clouds based on an improved transformer. The sketch curve parameters are formulated as position queries and optimized in an autoregressive way, leading to high parameter accuracy. The topology is rebuilt by extrusion segmentation, and each extrusion parameter (sketch and extrusion operation) is recovered by combining the predicted curves and the computed extrusion operation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is superior in primitive prediction accuracy and CAD reconstruction. The reconstructed shapes are of high geometrical fidelity.

- **[Uni4D: A Unified Self-Supervised Learning Framework for Point Cloud Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04837)**  `arXiv:2504.04837`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhi Zuo, Chenyi Zhuang, Pan Gao, Jie Qin, Hao Feng, Nicu Sebe_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-supervised representation learning for point cloud videos remains a challenging problem with two key limitations: (1) existing methods rely on explicit knowledge to learn motion, resulting in suboptimal representations; (2) prior Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) frameworks struggle to bridge the gap between low-level geometry and high-level dynamics in 4D data. In this work, we propose a novel self-disentangled MAE for learning expressive, discriminative, and transferable 4D representations. To overcome the first limitation, we learn motion by aligning high-level semantics in the latent space \textit{without any explicit knowledge}. To tackle the second, we introduce a \textit{self-disentangled learning} strategy that incorporates the latent token with the geometry token within a shared decoder, effectively disentangling low-level geometry and high-level semantics. In addition to the reconstruction objective, we employ three alignment objectives to enhance temporal understanding, including frame-level motion and video-level global information. We show that our pre-trained encoder surprisingly discriminates spatio-temporal representation without further fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on MSR-Action3D, NTU-RGBD, HOI4D, NvGesture, and SHREC'17 demonstrate the superiority of our approach in both coarse-grained and fine-grained 4D downstream tasks. Notably, Uni4D improves action segmentation accuracy on HOI4D by $+3.8\%$.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Precise classification of megakaryocytes is crucial for diagnosing myelodysplastic syndromes. Although self-supervised learning has shown promise in medical image analysis, its application to classifying megakaryocytes in stained slides faces three main challenges: (1) pervasive background noise that obscures cellular details, (2) a long-tailed distribution that limits data for rare subtypes, and (3) complex morphological variations leading to high intra-class variability. To address these issues, we propose the ActiveSSF framework, which integrates active learning with self-supervised pretraining. Specifically, our approach employs Gaussian filtering combined with K-means clustering and HSV analysis (augmented by clinical prior knowledge) for accurate region-of-interest extraction; an adaptive sample selection mechanism that dynamically adjusts similarity thresholds to mitigate class imbalance; and prototype clustering on labeled samples to overcome morphological complexity. Experimental results on clinical megakaryocyte datasets demonstrate that ActiveSSF not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also significantly improves recognition accuracy for rare subtypes. Moreover, the integration of these advanced techniques further underscores the practical potential of ActiveSSF in clinical settings.

  Creating relightable and animatable avatars from multi-view or monocular videos is a challenging task for digital human creation and virtual reality applications. Previous methods rely on neural radiance fields or ray tracing, resulting in slow training and rendering processes. By utilizing Gaussian Splatting, we propose a simple and efficient method to decouple body materials and lighting from sparse-view or monocular avatar videos, so that the avatar can be rendered simultaneously under novel viewpoints, poses, and lightings at interactive frame rates (6.9 fps). Specifically, we first obtain the canonical body mesh using a signed distance function and assign attributes to each mesh vertex. The Gaussians in the canonical space then interpolate from nearby body mesh vertices to obtain the attributes. We subsequently deform the Gaussians to the posed space using forward skinning, and combine the learnable environment light with the Gaussian attributes for shading computation. To achieve fast shadow modeling, we rasterize the posed body mesh from dense viewpoints to obtain the visibility. Our approach is not only simple but also fast enough to allow interactive rendering of avatar animation under environmental light changes. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to previous works, our method can render higher quality results at a faster speed on both synthetic and real datasets.

  Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of tasks, but adapting them efficiently to new domains remains a key challenge. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by introducing lightweight, trainable modules while keeping most pre-trained weights fixed. The prevailing approach, LoRA, models updates using a low-rank decomposition, but its expressivity is inherently constrained by the rank. Recent methods like HiRA aim to increase expressivity by incorporating a Hadamard product with the frozen weights, but still rely on the structure of the pre-trained model. We introduce ABBA, a new PEFT architecture that reparameterizes the update as a Hadamard product of two independently learnable low-rank matrices. In contrast to prior work, ABBA fully decouples the update from the pre-trained weights, enabling both components to be optimized freely. This leads to significantly higher expressivity under the same parameter budget. We formally analyze ABBA's expressive capacity and validate its advantages through matrix reconstruction experiments. Empirically, ABBA achieves state-of-the-art results on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing PEFT methods by a significant margin across multiple models.

  Safety guardrails in large language models (LLMs) are a critical component in preventing harmful outputs. Yet, their resilience under perturbation remains poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of safety fine-tuning in LLMs by systematically injecting Gaussian noise into model activations. We show across multiple open-weight models that (1) Gaussian noise raises harmful-output rates (p < 0.001) by up to 27%, (2) that deeper safety fine-tuning affords no extra protection, and (3) that chain-of-thought reasoning remains largely intact. The findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in current safety alignment techniques and highlight the potential of reasoning-based and reinforcement learning approaches as promising direction for developing more robust AI safety systems. These results have important implications for real-world deployment of LLMs in safety-critical applications as these results imply that widely-deployed safety tuning methods can fail even without adversarial prompts.

  Modern software systems generate extensive heterogeneous log data with dynamic formats, fragmented event sequences, and varying temporal patterns, making anomaly detection both crucial and challenging. To address these complexities, we propose ADALog, an adaptive, unsupervised anomaly detection framework designed for practical applicability across diverse real-world environments. Unlike traditional methods reliant on log parsing, strict sequence dependencies, or labeled data, ADALog operates on individual unstructured logs, extracts intra-log contextual relationships, and performs adaptive thresholding on normal data. The proposed approach utilizes a transformer-based, pretrained bidirectional encoder with a masked language modeling task, fine-tuned on normal logs to capture domain-specific syntactic and semantic patterns essential for accurate anomaly detection. Anomalies are identified via token-level reconstruction probabilities, aggregated into log-level scores, with adaptive percentile-based thresholding calibrated only on normal data. This allows the model to dynamically adapt to evolving system behaviors while avoiding rigid, heuristic-based thresholds common in traditional systems. We evaluate ADALog on benchmark datasets BGL, Thunderbird, and Spirit, showing strong generalization and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. Additional ablation studies examine the effects of masking, fine-tuning, and token positioning on model behavior and interpretability.

  Producing emotionally dynamic 3D facial avatars with text derived from spoken words (Emo3D) has been a pivotal research topic in 3D avatar generation. While progress has been made in general-purpose 3D avatar generation, the exploration of generating emotional 3D avatars remains scarce, primarily due to the complexities of identifying and rendering rich emotions from spoken words. This paper reexamines Emo3D generation and draws inspiration from human processes, breaking down Emo3D into two cascading steps: Text-to-3D Expression Mapping (T3DEM) and 3D Avatar Rendering (3DAR). T3DEM is the most crucial step in determining the quality of Emo3D generation and encompasses three key challenges: Expression Diversity, Emotion-Content Consistency, and Expression Fluidity. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel benchmark to advance research in Emo3D generation. First, we present EmoAva, a large-scale, high-quality dataset for T3DEM, comprising 15,000 text-to-3D expression mappings that characterize the aforementioned three challenges in Emo3D generation. Furthermore, we develop various metrics to effectively evaluate models against these identified challenges. Next, to effectively model the consistency, diversity, and fluidity of human expressions in the T3DEM step, we propose the Continuous Text-to-Expression Generator, which employs an autoregressive Conditional Variational Autoencoder for expression code generation, enhanced with Latent Temporal Attention and Expression-wise Attention mechanisms. Finally, to further enhance the 3DAR step on rendering higher-quality subtle expressions, we present the Globally-informed Gaussian Avatar (GiGA) model. GiGA incorporates a global information mechanism into 3D Gaussian representations, enabling the capture of subtle micro-expressions and seamless transitions between emotional states.
