  Accurate cell type annotation is a crucial step in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, which provides valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity. However, due to the high dimensionality and prevalence of zero elements in scRNA-seq data, traditional clustering methods face significant statistical and computational challenges. While some advanced methods use graph neural networks to model cell-cell relationships, they often depend on static graph structures that are sensitive to noise and fail to capture the long-tailed distribution inherent in single-cellthis http URLaddress these limitations, we propose scAGC, a single-cell clustering method that learns adaptive cell graphs with contrastive guidance. Our approach optimizes feature representations and cell graphs simultaneously in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we introduce a topology-adaptive graph autoencoder that leverages a differentiable Gumbel-Softmax sampling strategy to dynamically refine the graph structure during training. This adaptive mechanism mitigates the problem of a long-tailed degree distribution by promoting a more balanced neighborhood structure. To model the discrete, over-dispersed, and zero-inflated nature of scRNA-seq data, we integrate a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) loss for robust feature reconstruction. Furthermore, a contrastive learning objective is incorporated to regularize the graph learning process and prevent abrupt changes in the graph topology, ensuring stability and enhancing convergence. Comprehensive experiments on 9 real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that scAGC consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, yielding the best NMI and ARI scores on 9 and 7 datasets,this http URLcode is available at Anonymous Github.

  Multimodal data are often incomplete and exhibit Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics in real-world scenarios. These inherent limitations lead to both modality heterogeneity through partial modality absence and data heterogeneity from distribution divergence, creating fundamental challenges for effective federated learning (FL). To address these coupled challenges, we propose FedRecon, the first method targeting simultaneous missing modality reconstruction and Non-IID adaptation in multimodal FL. Our approach first employs a lightweight Multimodal Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) to reconstruct missing modalities while preserving cross-modal consistency. Distinct from conventional imputation methods, we achieve sample-level alignment through a novel distribution mapping mechanism that guarantees both data consistency and completeness. Additionally, we introduce a strategy employing global generator freezing to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which in turn mitigates Non-IID fluctuations. Extensive evaluations on multimodal datasets demonstrate FedRecon's superior performance in modality reconstruction under Non-IID conditions, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

  Brain connectomes, representing neural connectivity as graphs, are crucial for understanding brain organization but costly and time-consuming to acquire, motivating generative approaches. Recent advances in graph generative modeling offer a data-driven alternative, enabling synthetic connectome generation and reducing dependence on large neuroimaging datasets. However, current models face key limitations: (i) compressing the whole graph into a single latent code (e.g., VGAEs) blurs fine-grained local motifs; (ii) relying on rich node attributes rarely available in connectomes reduces reconstruction quality; (iii) edge-centric models emphasize topology but overlook accurate edge-weight prediction, harming quantitative fidelity; and (iv) computationally expensive designs (e.g., edge-conditioned convolutions) impose high memory demands, limiting scalability. We propose GraphTreeGen (GTG), a subtree-centric generative framework for efficient, accurate connectome synthesis. GTG decomposes each connectome into entropy-guided k-hop trees capturing informative local structure, encoded by a shared GCN. A bipartite message-passing layer fuses subtree embeddings with global node features, while a dual-branch decoder jointly predicts edge existence and weights to reconstruct the adjacency matrix. GTG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in self-supervised tasks and remains competitive in supervised settings, delivering higher structural fidelity and more precise weights with far less memory. Its modular design enables extensions to connectome super-resolution and cross-modality synthesis. Code:this https URL

- **[Enhancing Memory Recall in LLMs with Gauss-Tin: A Hybrid Instructional and Gaussian Replay Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09510)**  `arXiv:2508.09510`  `cs.LG`

  Despite the significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), catastrophic forgetting remains a substantial challenge, where models lose previously acquired knowledge upon learning new information. Continual learning (CL) strategies have emerged as a potential solution to this problem, with replay-based techniques demonstrating superior performance in preserving learned knowledge. In this context, we introduce Gauss-Tin, a novel approach that integrates the replay strategy with a Gaussian mixture model to enhance the quality of sample selection during training, supplemented by instructional guidance to facilitate the generation of past learning. This method aims to improve LLMs' retention capabilities by strategically reinforcing important past learnings while accommodating new information. Our experimental results indicate a promising 6\% improvement in retention metrics over traditional methods, suggesting that Gauss-Tin is an effective strategy for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in LLMs. This study underscores the potential of hybrid models in enhancing the robustness and adaptability of LLMs in dynamic learning environments.

- **[Resurrecting the Salmon: Rethinking Mechanistic Interpretability with Domain-Specific Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09363)**  `arXiv:2508.09363`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose large language model (LLM) activations into latent features that reveal mechanistic structure. Conventional SAEs train on broad data distributions, forcing a fixed latent budget to capture only high-frequency, generic patterns. This often results in significant linear ``dark matter'' in reconstruction error and produces latents that fragment or absorb each other, complicating interpretation. We show that restricting SAE training to a well-defined domain (medical text) reallocates capacity to domain-specific features, improving both reconstruction fidelity and interpretability. Training JumpReLU SAEs on layer-20 activations of Gemma-2 models using 195k clinical QA examples, we find that domain-confined SAEs explain up to 20\% more variance, achieve higher loss recovery, and reduce linear residual error compared to broad-domain SAEs. Automated and human evaluations confirm that learned features align with clinically meaningful concepts (e.g., ``taste sensations'' or ``infectious mononucleosis''), rather than frequent but uninformative tokens. These domain-specific SAEs capture relevant linear structure, leaving a smaller, more purely nonlinear residual. We conclude that domain-confinement mitigates key limitations of broad-domain SAEs, enabling more complete and interpretable latent decompositions, and suggesting the field may need to question ``foundation-model'' scaling for general-purpose SAEs.

  Next generation advanced nuclear reactors are expected to be smaller both in size and power output, relying extensively on fully digital instrumentation and control systems. These reactors will generate a large flow of information in the form of multivariate time series data, conveying simultaneously various non linear cyber physical, process, control, sensor, and operational states. Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is becoming increasingly important for networked communication and a requirement for safe and reliable operation. Current efforts to address replay attacks, almost universally focus on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection approaches without further identifying and characterizing the root cause of the anomaly. In addition, these approaches rely mostly on synthetic data with uncorrelated Gaussian process and measurement noise and full state feedback or are limited to univariate signals, signal stationarity, linear quadratic regulators, or other linear-time invariant state-space which may fail to capture any unmodeled system dynamics. In the realm of regulated nuclear cyber-physical systems, additional work is needed on characterization of replay attacks and explainability of predictions using real data. Here, we propose an unsupervised explainable AI framework based on a combination of autoencoder and customized windowSHAP algorithm to fully characterize real-time replay attacks, i.e., detection, source identification, timing and type, of increasing complexity during a dynamic time evolving reactor process. The proposed XAI framework was benchmarked on several real world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor PUR-1 with up to six signals concurrently being replayed. In all cases, the XAI framework was able to detect and identify the source and number of signals being replayed and the duration of the falsification with 95 percent or better accuracy.

  The rapid growth of Large Language Models has driven demand for effective model compression techniques to reduce memory and computation costs. Low-rank pruning has gained attention for its GPU compatibility across all densities. However, low-rank pruning struggles to match the performance of semi-structured pruning, often doubling perplexity at similar densities. In this paper, we propose Pivoting Factorization (PIFA), a novel lossless meta low-rank representation that unsupervisedly learns a compact form of any low-rank representation, effectively eliminating redundant information. PIFA identifies pivot rows (linearly independent rows) and expresses non-pivot rows as linear combinations, achieving 24.2% additional memory savings and 24.6% faster inference over low-rank layers at rank = 50% of dimension. To mitigate the performance degradation caused by low-rank pruning, we introduce a novel, retraining-free reconstruction method that minimizes error accumulation (M). MPIFA, combining M and PIFA into an end-to-end framework, significantly outperforms existing low-rank pruning methods, and achieves performance comparable to semi-structured pruning, while surpassing it in GPU efficiency and compatibility.

- **[Distilling LLM Prior to Flow Model for Generalizable Agent's Imagination in Object Goal Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09423)**  `arXiv:2508.09423`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task challenges agents to locate a specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions of the scene. Prior approaches rely on deterministic and discriminative models to complete semantic maps, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in indoor layouts and limiting their ability to generalize to unseen environments. In this work, we propose GOAL, a generative flow-based framework that models the semantic distribution of indoor environments by bridging observed regions with LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps. During training, spatial priors inferred from large language models (LLMs) are encoded as two-dimensional Gaussian fields and injected into target maps, distilling rich contextual knowledge into the flow model and enabling more generalizable completions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D and Gibson, and shows strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D.

- **[Multi-view Normal and Distance Guidance Gaussian Splatting for Surface Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07701)**  `arXiv:2508.07701`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves remarkable results in the field of surface reconstruction. However, when Gaussian normal vectors are aligned within the single-view projection plane, while the geometry appears reasonable in the current view, biases may emerge upon switching to nearby views. To address the distance and global matching challenges in multi-view scenes, we design multi-view normal and distance-guided Gaussian splatting. This method achieves geometric depth unification and high-accuracy reconstruction by constraining nearby depth maps and aligning 3D normals. Specifically, for the reconstruction of small indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose a multi-view distance reprojection regularization module that achieves multi-view Gaussian alignment by computing the distance loss between two nearby views and the same Gaussian surface. Additionally, we develop a multi-view normal enhancement module, which ensures consistency across views by matching the normals of pixel points in nearby views and calculating the loss. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, significantly enhancing the surface reconstruction capability of 3DGS. Our code will be made publicly available at (this https URL).

  Glioblastoma is a highly invasive brain tumor with rapid progression rates. Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection. However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular, graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms baseline methods and demonstrates robustness in incomplete or missing data scenarios, contributing to the development of virtual biopsy tools for rapid diagnostics.

  The proliferation of foundation models, pretrained on large-scale unlabeled datasets, has emerged as an effective approach in creating adaptable and reusable architectures that can be leveraged for various downstream tasks using satellite observations. However, their direct application to hyperspectral remote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the scarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned representations from a teacher model into a student model for effective development of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical knowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a simpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across different types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building upon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi foundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery. HyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by introducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function tailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral domain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for geospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly improves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction fidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction, underpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.

- **[Gradient-Direction-Aware Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09239)**  `arXiv:2508.09239`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced novel view synthesis through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware adaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key innovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control. Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact scene representations with 50\% reduced memory consumption through optimized Gaussians utilization.

  _Abdolazim Rezaei, Mehdi Sookhak, Mahboobeh Haghparast_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the fundamental right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as blurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable trade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction attacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we propose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into privacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image transmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic accuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of replay attacks to just 9.4\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously generating richer textual content than baseline methods. Our work provides a practical and scalable solution for building trustworthy AI systems in privacy-sensitive domains, paving the way for more secure smart city and autonomous vehicle networks.

- **[A Context-aware Attention and Graph Neural Network-based Multimodal Framework for Misogyny Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09175)**  `arXiv:2508.09175`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  A substantial portion of offensive content on social media is directed towards women. Since the approaches for general offensive content detection face a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions tailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist content. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module (MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the Content-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive gating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on relevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant features. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual modalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features such as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set of misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the text. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the predictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and 13,494 samples, respectively. The proposed method demonstrates an average improvement of 10.17% and 8.88% in macro-F1 over existing methods on the MAMI and MMHS150K datasets, respectively.

  Existing unsupervised keypoint detection methods apply artificial deformations to images such as masking a significant portion of images and using reconstruction of original image as a learning objective to detect keypoints. However, this approach lacks depth information in the image and often detects keypoints on the background. To address this, we propose Distill-DKP, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that leverages depth maps and RGB images for keypoint detection in a self-supervised setting. During training, Distill-DKP extracts embedding-level knowledge from a depth-based teacher model to guide an image-based student model with inference restricted to the student. Experiments show that Distill-DKP significantly outperforms previous unsupervised methods by reducing mean L2 error by 47.15% on Human3.6M, mean average error by 5.67% on Taichi, and improving keypoints accuracy by 1.3% on DeepFashion dataset. Detailed ablation studies demonstrate the sensitivity of knowledge distillation across different layers of the network. Project Page:this https URL

  _Geonhee Sim, Gyeongsik Moon_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Two major approaches exist for creating animatable human avatars. The first, a 3D-based approach, optimizes a NeRF- or 3DGS-based avatar from videos of a single person, achieving personalization through a disentangled identity representation. However, modeling pose-driven deformations, such as non-rigid cloth deformations, requires numerous pose-rich videos, which are costly and impractical to capture in daily life. The second, a diffusion-based approach, learns pose-driven deformations from large-scale in-the-wild videos but struggles with identity preservation and pose-dependent identity entanglement. We present PERSONA, a framework that combines the strengths of both approaches to obtain a personalized 3D human avatar with pose-driven deformations from a single image. PERSONA leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate pose-rich videos from the input image and optimizes a 3D avatar based on them. To ensure high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses, we introduce balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization. Balanced sampling oversamples the input image to mitigate identity shifts in diffusion-generated training videos. Geometry-weighted optimization prioritizes geometry constraints over image loss, preserving rendering quality in diverse poses.

  _Tom√°s de la Sotta, Jos√© M. Saavedra, H√©ctor Henr√≠quez, Violeta Chang, Aline Xavier_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation exposure but increase image noise, compromising diagnostic confidence. Diffusion-based generative models have shown promise for LDCT denoising by learning image priors and performing iterative refinement. In this work, we introduce AST-n, an accelerated inference framework that initiates reverse diffusion from intermediate noise levels, and integrate high-order ODE solvers within conditioned models to further reduce sampling steps. We evaluate two acceleration paradigms--AST-n sampling and standard scheduling with high-order solvers -- on the Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset, covering head, abdominal, and chest scans at 10-25 % of standard dose. Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM) above 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time from ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers substantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also assess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling inference time, limiting its clinical practicality. Our results demonstrate that AST-n with high-order samplers enables rapid LDCT reconstruction without significant loss of image fidelity, advancing the feasibility of diffusion-based methods in clinical workflows.

  Novel view synthesis and 4D reconstruction techniques predominantly rely on RGB cameras, thereby inheriting inherent limitations such as the dependence on adequate lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and a limited dynamic range. Event cameras, offering advantages of low power, high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, have brought a new perspective to addressing the scene reconstruction challenges in high-speed motion and low-light scenes. To this end, we propose E-4DGS, the first event-driven dynamic Gaussian Splatting approach, for novel view synthesis from multi-view event streams with fast-moving cameras. Specifically, we introduce an event-based initialization scheme to ensure stable training and propose event-adaptive slicing splatting for time-aware reconstruction. Additionally, we employ intensity importance pruning to eliminate floating artifacts and enhance 3D consistency, while incorporating an adaptive contrast threshold for more precise optimization. We design a synthetic multi-view camera setup with six moving event cameras surrounding the object in a 360-degree configuration and provide a benchmark multi-view event stream dataset that captures challenging motion scenarios. Our approach outperforms both event-only and event-RGB fusion baselines and paves the way for the exploration of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a novel approach for rapid scene capture.

  \textbf{Synthetic human dynamics} aims to generate photorealistic videos of human subjects performing expressive, intention-driven motions. However, current approaches face two core challenges: (1) \emph{geometric inconsistency} and \emph{coarse reconstruction}, due to limited 3D modeling and detail preservation; and (2) \emph{motion generalization limitations} and \emph{scene inharmonization}, stemming from weak generative capabilities. To address these, we present \textbf{HumanGenesis}, a framework that integrates geometric and generative modeling through four collaborative agents: (1) \textbf{Reconstructor} builds 3D-consistent human-scene representations from monocular video using 3D Gaussian Splatting and deformation decomposition. (2) \textbf{Critique Agent} enhances reconstruction fidelity by identifying and refining poor regions via multi-round MLLM-based reflection. (3) \textbf{Pose Guider} enables motion generalization by generating expressive pose sequences using time-aware parametric encoders. (4) \textbf{Video Harmonizer} synthesizes photorealistic, coherent video via a hybrid rendering pipeline with diffusion, refining the Reconstructor through a Back-to-4D feedback loop. HumanGenesis achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including text-guided synthesis, video reenactment, and novel-pose generalization, significantly improving expressiveness, geometric fidelity, and scene integration.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Encoding videos into discrete tokens could align with text tokens to facilitate concise and unified multi-modal LLMs, yet introducing significant spatiotemporal compression compared to continuous video representation. Previous discrete video VAEs experienced unstable training, long training time, and degraded reconstruction quality. Given the easier training and superior performance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video VAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between discrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively preserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization methods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster than training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence. Meanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how continuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we introduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB improvement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second, to tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we strengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this information in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x 16 x 16 discrete VAEs. Furthermore, we propose a joint discrete-continuous optimization scheme that unifies the two paradigms and, for the first time, achieves competitive performance on both continuous and discrete representations within a single network. We name our method OneVAE to reflect this connection.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Convolution and transposed convolution are fundamental operators widely used in neural networks. However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization, 1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures, leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and applications.

  Computational imaging, especially non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, the extraction of information from obscured or hidden scenes is achieved through the utilization of indirect light signals resulting from multiple reflections or scattering. The inherently weak nature of these signals, coupled with their susceptibility to noise, necessitates the integration of physical processes to ensure accurate reconstruction. This paper presents a parameterized inverse problem framework tailored for large-scale linear problems in 3D imaging reconstruction. Initially, a noise estimation module is employed to adaptively assess the noise levels present in transient data. Subsequently, a parameterized neural operator is developed to approximate the inverse mapping, facilitating end-to-end rapid image reconstruction. Our 3D image reconstruction framework, grounded in operator learning, is constructed through deep algorithm unfolding, which not only provides commendable model interpretability but also enables dynamic adaptation to varying noise levels in the acquired data, thereby ensuring consistently robust and accurate reconstruction outcomes. Furthermore, we introduce a novel method for the fusion of global and local spatiotemporal data features. By integrating structural and detailed information, this method significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness. Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. It demonstrates remarkable performance with fast scanning data and sparse illumination point data, offering a viable solution for NLOS imaging in complex scenarios.

  We revisit the role of texture in monocular 3D hand reconstruction, not as an afterthought for photorealism, but as a dense, spatially grounded cue that can actively support pose and shape estimation. Our observation is simple: even in high-performing models, the overlay between predicted hand geometry and image appearance is often imperfect, suggesting that texture alignment may be an underused supervisory signal. We propose a lightweight texture module that embeds per-pixel observations into UV texture space and enables a novel dense alignment loss between predicted and observed hand appearances. Our approach assumes access to a differentiable rendering pipeline and a model that maps images to 3D hand meshes with known topology, allowing us to back-project a textured hand onto the image and perform pixel-based alignment. The module is self-contained and easily pluggable into existing reconstruction pipelines. To isolate and highlight the value of texture-guided supervision, we augment HaMeR, a high-performing yet unadorned transformer architecture for 3D hand pose estimation. The resulting system improves both accuracy and realism, demonstrating the value of appearance-guided alignment in hand reconstruction.

  Creating high-fidelity and editable head avatars is a pivotal challenge in computer vision and graphics, boosting many AR/VR applications. While recent advancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation, head editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due to the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and global appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head Avatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the geometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled texture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two types of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance of head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture editing, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of non-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence between 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping method, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp texture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization strategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both reconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble dataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results, but also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian head avatars and support real-time appearance editing.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-exposure correction technology is essential for restoring images affected by insufficient or excessive lighting, enhancing the visual experience by improving brightness, contrast, and detail richness. However, current multi-exposure correction methods often encounter challenges in addressing intra-class variability caused by diverse lighting conditions, shooting environments, and weather factors, particularly when processing images captured at a single exposure level. To enhance the adaptability of these models under complex imaging conditions, this paper proposes a Wavelet-based Exposure Correction method with Degradation Guidance (WEC-DG). Specifically, we introduce a degradation descriptor within the Exposure Consistency Alignment Module (ECAM) at both ends of the processing pipeline to ensure exposure consistency and achieve final alignment. This mechanism effectively addresses miscorrected exposure anomalies caused by existing methods' failure to recognize 'blurred' exposure degradation. Additionally, we investigate the light-detail decoupling properties of the wavelet transform to design the Exposure Restoration and Detail Reconstruction Module (EDRM), which processes low-frequency information related to exposure enhancement before utilizing high-frequency information as a prior guide for reconstructing spatial domain details. This serial processing strategy guarantees precise light correction and enhances detail recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing algorithms, achieving significant performance improvements and validating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

  Deep networks have achieved remarkable success in image compressed sensing (CS) task, namely reconstructing a high-fidelity image from its compressed measurement. However, existing works are deficient inincoherent compressed measurement at sensing phase and implicit measurement representations at reconstruction phase, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we answer two questions: 1) how to improve the measurement incoherence for decreasing the ill-posedness; 2) how to learn informative representations from measurements. To this end, we propose a novel asymmetric Kronecker CS (AKCS) model and theoretically present its better incoherence than previous Kronecker CS with minimal complexity increase. Moreover, we reveal that the unfolding networks' superiority over non-unfolding ones result from sufficient gradient descents, called explicit measurement representations. We propose a measurement-aware cross attention (MACA) mechanism to learn implicit measurement representations. We integrate AKCS and MACA into widely-used unfolding architecture to get a measurement-enhanced unfolding network (MEUNet). Extensive experiences demonstrate that our MEUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction accuracy and inference speed.

  _Ju Yeon Kang, Jaehong Park, Semin Kim, Ji Won Yoon, Nam Soo Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, diffusion-generated image detection has gained increasing attention, as the rapid advancement of diffusion models has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse. While existing detection methods have achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models, since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this limitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images. Motivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity to their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images, which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative feature for robust detection across diverse generative models. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization, outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and CommunityForensics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Three-dimensional scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images is a long-standing and challenging task. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its variants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing methods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization capability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential, but they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to limited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel self-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable 3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for improved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and radiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need for ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency Module (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via consistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy that refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization methods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy. It also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to 1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.

  Micro-expression recognition (MER) is crucial in the affective computing field due to its wide application in medical diagnosis, lie detection, and criminal investigation. Despite its significance, obtaining micro-expression (ME) annotations is challenging due to the expertise required from psychological professionals. Consequently, ME datasets often suffer from a scarcity of training samples, severely constraining the learning of MER models. While current large pre-training models (LMs) offer general and discriminative representations, their direct application to MER is hindered by an inability to capture transitory and subtle facial movements-essential elements for effective MER. This paper introduces Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) as a novel approach to adapting LMs for MER, representing a pioneering method for subtle motion prompt tuning. Particularly, we introduce motion prompt generation, including motion magnification and Gaussian tokenization, to extract subtle motions as prompts for LMs. Additionally, a group adapter is carefully designed and inserted into the LM to enhance it in the target MER domain, facilitating a more nuanced distinction of ME representation. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted on three widely used MER datasets demonstrate that our proposed MPT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches and verifies its effectiveness.

  Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and 3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key advantages: 1) 360¬∞ immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2) mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh representation that leverages panoramic images as 360¬∞ world proxies for semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality, physical simulation, game development, and interactive content creation.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts, causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA) method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under real-world distribution shifts. Code:this https URL.

  Hyperspectral reconstruction (HSR) from RGB images is a fundamentally ill-posed problem due to severe spectral information loss. Existing approaches typically rely on a single RGB image, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel multi-image-to-hyperspectral reconstruction (MI-HSR) framework that leverages a triple-camera smartphone system, where two lenses are equipped with carefully selected spectral filters. Our configuration, grounded in theoretical and empirical analysis, enables richer and more diverse spectral observations than conventional single-camera setups. To support this new paradigm, we introduce Doomer, the first dataset for MI-HSR, comprising aligned images from three smartphone cameras and a hyperspectral reference camera across diverse scenes. We show that the proposed HSR model achieves consistent improvements over existing methods on the newly proposed benchmark. In a nutshell, our setup allows 30% towards more accurately estimated spectra compared to an ordinary RGB camera. Our findings suggest that multi-view spectral filtering with commodity hardware can unlock more accurate and practical hyperspectral imaging solutions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons, prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of PGA. Our code is available at:this https URL.

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves impressive quality and rendering speed, but with millions of 3D Gaussians and significant storage and transmission costs. In this paper, we aim to develop a simple yet effective method called NeuralGS that compresses the original 3DGS into a compact representation. Our observation is that neural fields like NeRF can represent complex 3D scenes with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks using only a few megabytes. Thus, NeuralGS effectively adopts the neural field representation to encode the attributes of 3D Gaussians with MLPs, only requiring a small storage size even for a large-scale scene. To achieve this, we adopt a clustering strategy and fit the Gaussians within each cluster using different tiny MLPs, based on importance scores of Gaussians as fitting weights. We experiment on multiple datasets, achieving a 91-times average model size reduction without harming the visual quality.

  Generating cognitive-aligned layered SVGs remains challenging due to existing methods' tendencies toward either oversimplified single-layer outputs or optimization-induced shape redundancies. We propose LayerTracer, a diffusion transformer based framework that bridges this gap by learning designers' layered SVG creation processes from a novel dataset of sequential design operations. Our approach operates in two phases: First, a text-conditioned DiT generates multi-phase rasterized construction blueprints that simulate human design workflows. Second, layer-wise vectorization with path deduplication produces clean, editable SVGs. For image vectorization, we introduce a conditional diffusion mechanism that encodes reference images into latent tokens, guiding hierarchical reconstruction while preserving structural integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate LayerTracer's superior performance against optimization-based and neural baselines in both generation quality and editability, effectively aligning AI-generated vectors with professional design cognition.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often face a modality representation gap during pretraining: while language embeddings remain stable, visual representations are highly sensitive to contextual noise (e.g., background clutter). To address this issue, we introduce a visual comprehension stage, which we call ViCToR (Visual Comprehension via Token Reconstruction), a novel pretraining framework for LMMs. ViCToR employs a learnable visual token pool and utilizes the Hungarian matching algorithm to select semantically relevant tokens from this pool for visual token replacement. Furthermore, by integrating a visual token reconstruction loss with dense semantic supervision, ViCToR can learn tokens which retain high visual detail, thereby enhancing the large language model's (LLM's) understanding of visual information. After pretraining on 3 million publicly accessible images and captions, ViCToR achieves state-of-the-art results, improving over LLaVA-NeXT-8B by 10.4%, 3.2%, and 7.2% on the MMStar, SEED$^I$, and RealWorldQA benchmarks, respectively.
