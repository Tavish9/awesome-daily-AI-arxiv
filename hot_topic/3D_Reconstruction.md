- **[Prior Does Matter: Visual Navigation via Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10041)**  `arXiv:2504.10041`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`  
  _Hao Ren, Yiming Zeng, Zetong Bi, Zhaoliang Wan, Junlong Huang, Hui Cheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in diffusion-based imitation learning, which show impressive performance in modeling multimodal distributions and training stability, have led to substantial progress in various robot learning tasks. In visual navigation, previous diffusion-based policies typically generate action sequences by initiating from denoising Gaussian noise. However, the target action distribution often diverges significantly from Gaussian noise, leading to redundant denoising steps and increased learning complexity. Additionally, the sparsity of effective action distributions makes it challenging for the policy to generate accurate actions without guidance. To address these issues, we propose a novel, unified visual navigation framework leveraging the denoising diffusion bridge models named NaviBridger. This approach enables action generation by initiating from any informative prior actions, enhancing guidance and efficiency in the denoising process. We explore how diffusion bridges can enhance imitation learning in visual navigation tasks and further examine three source policies for generating prior actions. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios demonstrate that NaviBridger accelerates policy inference and outperforms the baselines in generating target action sequences.

  Camera-based tactile sensors provide robots with a high-performance tactile sensing approach for environment perception and dexterous manipulation. However, achieving comprehensive environmental perception still requires cooperation with additional sensors, which makes the system bulky and limits its adaptability to unstructured environments. In this work, we present a vision-enhanced camera-based dual-modality sensor, which realizes full-scale distance sensing from 50 cm to -3 mm while simultaneously keeping ultra-high-resolution texture sensing and reconstruction capabilities. Unlike conventional designs with fixed opaque gel layers, our sensor features a partially transparent sliding window, enabling mechanical switching between tactile and visual modes. For each sensing mode, a dynamic distance sensing model and a contact geometry reconstruction model are proposed. Through integration with soft robotic fingers, we systematically evaluate the performance of each mode, as well as in their synergistic operation. Experimental results show robust distance tracking across various speeds, nanometer-scale roughness detection, and sub-millimeter 3D texture reconstruction. The combination of both modalities improves the robot's efficiency in executing grasping tasks. Furthermore, the embedded mechanical transmission in the sensor allows for fine-grained intra-hand adjustments and precise manipulation, unlocking new capabilities for soft robotic hands.

- **[Efficient Task-specific Conditional Diffusion Policies: Shortcut Model Acceleration and SO(3) Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09927)**  `arXiv:2504.09927`  `cs.RO`  
  _Haiyong Yu, Yanqiong Jin, Yonghao He, Wei Sui_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imitation learning, particularly Diffusion Policies based methods, has recently gained significant traction in embodied AI as a powerful approach to action policy generation. These models efficiently generate action policies by learning to predict noise. However, conventional Diffusion Policy methods rely on iterative denoising, leading to inefficient inference and slow response times, which hinder real-time robot control. To address these limitations, we propose a Classifier-Free Shortcut Diffusion Policy (CF-SDP) that integrates classifier-free guidance with shortcut-based acceleration, enabling efficient task-specific action generation while significantly improving inference speed. Furthermore, we extend diffusion modeling to the SO(3) manifold in shortcut model, defining the forward and reverse processes in its tangent space with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. This ensures stable and accurate rotational estimation, enhancing the effectiveness of diffusion-based control. Our approach achieves nearly 5x acceleration in diffusion inference compared to DDIM-based Diffusion Policy while maintaining task performance. Evaluations both on the RoboTwin simulation platform and real-world scenarios across various tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method.

  _Yi Han, Zixin Lin, Dongjie Li, Lvping Chen, Yongliang Shi, Gan Ma_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transparent object grasping remains a persistent challenge in robotics, largely due to the difficulty of acquiring precise 3D information. Conventional optical 3D sensors struggle to capture transparent objects, and machine learning methods are often hindered by their reliance on high-quality datasets. Leveraging NeRF's capability for continuous spatial opacity modeling, our proposed architecture integrates a NeRF-based approach for reconstructing the 3D information of transparent objects. Despite this, certain portions of the reconstructed 3D information may remain incomplete. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a shape-prior-driven completion mechanism, further refined by a geometric pose estimation method we have developed. This allows us to obtain a complete and reliable 3D information of transparent objects. Utilizing this refined data, we perform scene-level grasp prediction and deploy the results in real-world robotic systems. Experimental validation demonstrates the efficacy of our architecture, showcasing its capability to reliably capture 3D information of various transparent objects in cluttered scenes, and correspondingly, achieve high-quality, stables, and executable grasp predictions.

- **[FedRecon: Missing Modality Reconstruction in Distributed Heterogeneous Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09941)**  `arXiv:2504.09941`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Junming Liu, Guosun Zeng, Ding Wang, Yanting Gao, Yufei Jin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal data are often incomplete and exhibit Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics in real-world scenarios. These inherent limitations lead to both modality heterogeneity through partial modality absence and data heterogeneity from distribution divergence, creating fundamental challenges for effective federated learning (FL). To address these coupled challenges, we propose FedRecon, the first method targeting simultaneous missing modality reconstruction and Non-IID adaptation in multimodal FL. Our approach first employs a lightweight Multimodal Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) to reconstruct missing modalities while preserving cross-modal consistency. Distinct from conventional imputation methods, we achieve sample-level alignment through a novel distribution mapping mechanism that guarantees both data consistency and completeness. Additionally, we introduce a strategy employing global generator freezing to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which in turn mitigates Non-IID fluctuations. Extensive evaluations on multimodal datasets demonstrate FedRecon's superior performance in modality reconstruction under Non-IID conditions, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

- **[Repetitive Contrastive Learning Enhances Mamba's Selectivity in Time Series Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09185)**  `arXiv:2504.09185`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Wenbo Yan, Hanzhong Cao, Ying Tan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long sequence prediction is a key challenge in time series forecasting. While Mamba-based models have shown strong performance due to their sequence selection capabilities, they still struggle with insufficient focus on critical time steps and incomplete noise suppression, caused by limited selective abilities. To address this, we introduce Repetitive Contrastive Learning (RCL), a token-level contrastive pretraining framework aimed at enhancing Mamba's selective capabilities. RCL pretrains a single Mamba block to strengthen its selective abilities and then transfers these pretrained parameters to initialize Mamba blocks in various backbone models, improving their temporal prediction performance. RCL uses sequence augmentation with Gaussian noise and applies inter-sequence and intra-sequence contrastive learning to help the Mamba module prioritize information-rich time steps while ignoring noisy ones. Extensive experiments show that RCL consistently boosts the performance of backbone models, surpassing existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, we propose two metrics to quantify Mamba's selective capabilities, providing theoretical, qualitative, and quantitative evidence for the improvements brought by RCL.

  _Samy-Melwan Vilhes, Gilles Gasso, Mokhtar Z Alaya_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) focuses on identifying whether observations in streaming data deviate significantly from normal patterns. With the prevalence of connected devices, anomaly detection on time series has become paramount, as it enables real-time monitoring and early detection of irregular behaviors across various application domains. In this work, we introduce PatchTrAD, a Patch-based Transformer model for time series anomaly detection. Our approach leverages a Transformer encoder along with the use of patches under a reconstructionbased framework for anomaly detection. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets show that PatchTrAD is on par, in terms of detection performance, with state-of-the-art deep learning models for anomaly detection while being time efficient during inference.

- **[Improving Controller Generalization with Dimensionless Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10006)**  `arXiv:2504.10006`  `cs.LG`  
  _Valentin Charvet, Sebastian Stein, Roderick Murray-Smith_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Controllers trained with Reinforcement Learning tend to be very specialized and thus generalize poorly when their testing environment differs from their training one. We propose a Model-Based approach to increase generalization where both world model and policy are trained in a dimensionless state-action space. To do so, we introduce the Dimensionless Markov Decision Process ($\Pi$-MDP): an extension of Contextual-MDPs in which state and action spaces are non-dimensionalized with the Buckingham-$\Pi$ theorem. This procedure induces policies that are equivariant with respect to changes in the context of the underlying dynamics. We provide a generic framework for this approach and apply it to a model-based policy search algorithm using Gaussian Process models. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on simulated actuated pendulum and cartpole systems, where policies trained on a single environment are robust to shifts in the distribution of the context.

- **[MonoDiff9D: Monocular Category-Level 9D Object Pose Estimation via Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10433)**  `arXiv:2504.10433`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Jian Liu, Wei Sun, Hui Yang, Jin Zheng, Zichen Geng, Hossein Rahmani, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object pose estimation is a core means for robots to understand and interact with their environment. For this task, monocular category-level methods are attractive as they require only a single RGB camera. However, current methods rely on shape priors or CAD models of the intra-class known objects. We propose a diffusion-based monocular category-level 9D object pose generation method, MonoDiff9D. Our motivation is to leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models to alleviate the need for shape priors, CAD models, or depth sensors for intra-class unknown object pose estimation. We first estimate coarse depth via DINOv2 from the monocular image in a zero-shot manner and convert it into a point cloud. We then fuse the global features of the point cloud with the input image and use the fused features along with the encoded time step to condition MonoDiff9D. Finally, we design a transformer-based denoiser to recover the object pose from Gaussian noise. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmark datasets show that MonoDiff9D achieves state-of-the-art monocular category-level 9D object pose estimation accuracy without the need for shape priors or CAD models at any stage. Our code will be made public atthis https URL.

- **[ST-Booster: An Iterative SpatioTemporal Perception Booster for Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09843)**  `arXiv:2504.09843`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Lu Yue, Dongliang Zhou, Liang Xie, Erwei Yin, Feitian Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires agents to navigate unknown, continuous spaces based on natural language instructions. Compared to discrete settings, VLN-CE poses two core perception challenges. First, the absence of predefined observation points leads to heterogeneous visual memories and weakened global spatial correlations. Second, cumulative reconstruction errors in three-dimensional scenes introduce structural noise, impairing local feature perception. To address these challenges, this paper proposes ST-Booster, an iterative spatiotemporal booster that enhances navigation performance through multi-granularity perception and instruction-aware reasoning. ST-Booster consists of three key modules -- Hierarchical SpatioTemporal Encoding (HSTE), Multi-Granularity Aligned Fusion (MGAF), and ValueGuided Waypoint Generation (VGWG). HSTE encodes long-term global memory using topological graphs and captures shortterm local details via grid maps. MGAF aligns these dualmap representations with instructions through geometry-aware knowledge fusion. The resulting representations are iteratively refined through pretraining tasks. During reasoning, VGWG generates Guided Attention Heatmaps (GAHs) to explicitly model environment-instruction relevance and optimize waypoint selection. Extensive comparative experiments and performance analyses are conducted, demonstrating that ST-Booster outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex, disturbance-prone environments.

- **[TextSplat: Text-Guided Semantic Fusion for Generalizable Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09588)**  `arXiv:2504.09588`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhicong Wu, Hongbin Xu, Gang Xu, Ping Nie, Zhixin Yan, Jinkai Zheng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Generalizable Gaussian Splatting have enabled robust 3D reconstruction from sparse input views by utilizing feed-forward Gaussian Splatting models, achieving superior cross-scene generalization. However, while many methods focus on geometric consistency, they often neglect the potential of text-driven guidance to enhance semantic understanding, which is crucial for accurately reconstructing fine-grained details in complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose TextSplat--the first text-driven Generalizable Gaussian Splatting framework. By employing a text-guided fusion of diverse semantic cues, our framework learns robust cross-modal feature representations that improve the alignment of geometric and semantic information, producing high-fidelity 3D reconstructions. Specifically, our framework employs three parallel modules to obtain complementary representations: the Diffusion Prior Depth Estimator for accurate depth information, the Semantic Aware Segmentation Network for detailed semantic information, and the Multi-View Interaction Network for refined cross-view features. Then, in the Text-Guided Semantic Fusion Module, these representations are integrated via the text-guided and attention-based feature aggregation mechanism, resulting in enhanced 3D Gaussian parameters enriched with detailed semantic cues. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework. The code will be publicly available.

- **[LL-Gaussian: Low-Light Scene Reconstruction and Enhancement via Gaussian Splatting for Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10331)**  `arXiv:2504.10331`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hao Sun, Fenggen Yu, Huiyao Xu, Tao Zhang, Changqing Zou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Novel view synthesis (NVS) in low-light scenes remains a significant challenge due to degraded inputs characterized by severe noise, low dynamic range (LDR) and unreliable initialization. While recent NeRF-based approaches have shown promising results, most suffer from high computational costs, and some rely on carefully captured or pre-processed data--such as RAW sensor inputs or multi-exposure sequences--which severely limits their practicality. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with competitive visual fidelity; however, existing 3DGS-based methods struggle with low-light sRGB inputs, resulting in unstable Gaussian initialization and ineffective noise suppression. To address these challenges, we propose LL-Gaussian, a novel framework for 3D reconstruction and enhancement from low-light sRGB images, enabling pseudo normal-light novel view synthesis. Our method introduces three key innovations: 1) an end-to-end Low-Light Gaussian Initialization Module (LLGIM) that leverages dense priors from learning-based MVS approach to generate high-quality initial point clouds; 2) a dual-branch Gaussian decomposition model that disentangles intrinsic scene properties (reflectance and illumination) from transient interference, enabling stable and interpretable optimization; 3) an unsupervised optimization strategy guided by both physical constrains and diffusion prior to jointly steer decomposition and enhancement. Additionally, we contribute a challenging dataset collected in extreme low-light environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of LL-Gaussian. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, LL-Gaussian achieves up to 2,000 times faster inference and reduces training time to just 2%, while delivering superior reconstruction and rendering quality.

- **[ESCT3D: Efficient and Selectively Controllable Text-Driven 3D Content Generation with Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10316)**  `arXiv:2504.10316`  `cs.CV`  
  _Huiqi Wu, Jianbo Mei, Yingjie Huang, Yining Xu, Jingjiao You, Yilong Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, significant advancements have been made in text-driven 3D content generation. However, several challenges remain. In practical applications, users often provide extremely simple text inputs while expecting high-quality 3D content. Generating optimal results from such minimal text is a difficult task due to the strong dependency of text-to-3D models on the quality of input prompts. Moreover, the generation process exhibits high variability, making it difficult to control. Consequently, multiple iterations are typically required to produce content that meets user expectations, reducing generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose GPT-4V for self-optimization, which significantly enhances the efficiency of generating satisfactory content in a single attempt. Furthermore, the controllability of text-to-3D generation methods has not been fully explored. Our approach enables users to not only provide textual descriptions but also specify additional conditions, such as style, edges, scribbles, poses, or combinations of multiple conditions, allowing for more precise control over the generated 3D content. Additionally, during training, we effectively integrate multi-view information, including multi-view depth, masks, features, and images, to address the common Janus problem in 3D content generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalization, facilitating the efficient and controllable generation of high-quality 3D content.

- **[EBAD-Gaussian: Event-driven Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10012)**  `arXiv:2504.10012`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yufei Deng, Yuanjian Wang, Rong Xiao, Chenwei Tang, Jizhe Zhou, Jiahao Fan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves photorealistic novel view synthesis, its performance degrades with motion blur. In scenarios with rapid motion or low-light conditions, existing RGB-based deblurring methods struggle to model camera pose and radiance changes during exposure, reducing reconstruction accuracy. Event cameras, capturing continuous brightness changes during exposure, can effectively assist in modeling motion blur and improving reconstruction quality. Therefore, we propose Event-driven Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting (EBAD-Gaussian), which reconstructs sharp 3D Gaussians from event streams and severely blurred images. This method jointly learns the parameters of these Gaussians while recovering camera motion trajectories during exposure time. Specifically, we first construct a blur loss function by synthesizing multiple latent sharp images during the exposure time, minimizing the difference between real and synthesized blurred images. Then we use event stream to supervise the light intensity changes between latent sharp images at any time within the exposure period, supplementing the light intensity dynamic changes lost in RGB images. Furthermore, we optimize the latent sharp images at intermediate exposure times based on the event-based double integral (EDI) prior, applying consistency constraints to enhance the details and texture information of the reconstructed images. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that EBAD-Gaussian can achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction under the condition of blurred images and event stream inputs.

- **[GaussVideoDreamer: 3D Scene Generation with Video Diffusion and Inconsistency-Aware Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10001)**  `arXiv:2504.10001`  `cs.CV`  
  _Junlin Hao, Peiheng Wang, Haoyang Wang, Xinggong Zhang, Zongming Guo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Single-image 3D scene reconstruction presents significant challenges due to its inherently ill-posed nature and limited input constraints. Recent advances have explored two promising directions: multiview generative models that train on 3D consistent datasets but struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, and 3D scene inpainting and completion frameworks that suffer from cross-view inconsistency and suboptimal error handling, as they depend exclusively on depth data or 3D smoothness, which ultimately degrades output quality and computational performance. Building upon these approaches, we present GaussVideoDreamer, which advances generative multimedia approaches by bridging the gap between image, video, and 3D generation, integrating their strengths through two key innovations: (1) A progressive video inpainting strategy that harnesses temporal coherence for improved multiview consistency and faster convergence. (2) A 3D Gaussian Splatting consistency mask to guide the video diffusion with 3D consistent multiview evidence. Our pipeline combines three core components: a geometry-aware initialization protocol, Inconsistency-Aware Gaussian Splatting, and a progressive video inpainting strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves 32% higher LLaVA-IQA scores and at least 2x speedup compared to existing methods while maintaining robust performance across diverse scenes.

- **[Beyond Degradation Redundancy: Contrastive Prompt Learning for All-in-One Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09973)**  `arXiv:2504.09973`  `cs.CV`  
  _Gang Wu, Junjun Jiang, Kui Jiang, Xianming Liu, Liqiang Nie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  All-in-one image restoration, addressing diverse degradation types with a unified model, presents significant challenges in designing task-specific prompts that effectively guide restoration across multiple degradation scenarios. While adaptive prompt learning enables end-to-end optimization, it often yields overlapping or redundant task representations. Conversely, explicit prompts derived from pretrained classifiers enhance discriminability but may discard critical visual information for reconstruction. To address these limitations, we introduce Contrastive Prompt Learning (CPL), a novel framework that fundamentally enhances prompt-task alignment through two complementary innovations: a \emph{Sparse Prompt Module (SPM)} that efficiently captures degradation-specific features while minimizing redundancy, and a \emph{Contrastive Prompt Regularization (CPR)} that explicitly strengthens task boundaries by incorporating negative prompt samples across different degradation types. Unlike previous approaches that focus primarily on degradation classification, CPL optimizes the critical interaction between prompts and the restoration model itself. Extensive experiments across five comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that CPL consistently enhances state-of-the-art all-in-one restoration models, achieving significant improvements in both standard multi-task scenarios and challenging composite degradation settings. Our framework establishes new state-of-the-art performance while maintaining parameter efficiency, offering a principled solution for unified image restoration.

- **[MCBlock: Boosting Neural Radiance Field Training Speed by MCTS-based Dynamic-Resolution Ray Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09878)**  `arXiv:2504.09878`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yunpeng Tan, Junlin Hao, Jiangkai Wu, Liming Liu, Qingyang Li, Xinggong Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is widely known for high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, even the state-of-the-art NeRF model, Gaussian Splatting, requires minutes for training, far from the real-time performance required by multimedia scenarios like telemedicine. One of the obstacles is its inefficient sampling, which is only partially addressed by existing works. Existing point-sampling algorithms uniformly sample simple-texture regions (easy to fit) and complex-texture regions (hard to fit), while existing ray-sampling algorithms sample these regions all in the finest granularity (i.e. the pixel level), both wasting GPU training resources. Actually, regions with different texture intensities require different sampling granularities. To this end, we propose a novel dynamic-resolution ray-sampling algorithm, MCBlock, which employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to partition each training image into pixel blocks with different sizes for active block-wise training. Specifically, the trees are initialized according to the texture of training images to boost the initialization speed, and an expansion/pruning module dynamically optimizes the block partition. MCBlock is implemented in Nerfstudio, an open-source toolset, and achieves a training acceleration of up to 2.33x, surpassing other ray-sampling algorithms. We believe MCBlock can apply to any cone-tracing NeRF model and contribute to the multimedia community.

  _Hao Wang, Xiaobao Wei, Xiaoan Zhang, Jianing Li, Chengyu Bai, Ying Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Online 3D occupancy prediction provides a comprehensive spatial understanding of embodied environments. While the innovative EmbodiedOcc framework utilizes 3D semantic Gaussians for progressive indoor occupancy prediction, it overlooks the geometric characteristics of indoor environments, which are primarily characterized by planar structures. This paper introduces EmbodiedOcc++, enhancing the original framework with two key innovations: a Geometry-guided Refinement Module (GRM) that constrains Gaussian updates through plane regularization, along with a Semantic-aware Uncertainty Sampler (SUS) that enables more effective updates in overlapping regions between consecutive frames. GRM regularizes the position update to align with surface normals. It determines the adaptive regularization weight using curvature-based and depth-based constraints, allowing semantic Gaussians to align accurately with planar surfaces while adapting in complex regions. To effectively improve geometric consistency from different views, SUS adaptively selects proper Gaussians to update. Comprehensive experiments on the EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet benchmark demonstrate that EmbodiedOcc++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across different settings. Our method demonstrates improved edge accuracy and retains more geometric details while ensuring computational efficiency, which is essential for online embodied perception. The code will be released at:this https URL.

- **[FastRSR: Efficient and Accurate Road Surface Reconstruction from Bird's Eye View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09535)**  `arXiv:2504.09535`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yuting Zhao, Yuheng Ji, Xiaoshuai Hao, Shuxiao Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Road Surface Reconstruction (RSR) is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling the understanding of road surface conditions. Recently, RSR from the Bird's Eye View (BEV) has gained attention for its potential to enhance performance. However, existing methods for transforming perspective views to BEV face challenges such as information loss and representation sparsity. Moreover, stereo matching in BEV is limited by the need to balance accuracy with inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose two efficient and accurate BEV-based RSR models: FastRSR-mono and FastRSR-stereo. Specifically, we first introduce Depth-Aware Projection (DAP), an efficient view transformation strategy designed to mitigate information loss and sparsity by querying depth and image features to aggregate BEV data within specific road surface regions using a pre-computed look-up table. To optimize accuracy and speed in stereo matching, we design the Spatial Attention Enhancement (SAE) and Confidence Attention Generation (CAG) modules. SAE adaptively highlights important regions, while CAG focuses on high-confidence predictions and filters out irrelevant information. FastRSR achieves state-of-the-art performance, exceeding monocular competitors by over 6.0% in elevation absolute error and providing at least a 3.0x speedup by stereo methods on the RSRD dataset. The source code will be released.

- **[DropoutGS: Dropping Out Gaussians for Better Sparse-view Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09491)**  `arXiv:2504.09491`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yexing Xu, Longguang Wang, Minglin Chen, Sheng Ao, Li Li, Yulan Guo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated promising results in novel view synthesis, its performance degrades dramatically with sparse inputs and generates undesirable artifacts. As the number of training views decreases, the novel view synthesis task degrades to a highly under-determined problem such that existing methods suffer from the notorious overfitting issue. Interestingly, we observe that models with fewer Gaussian primitives exhibit less overfitting under sparse inputs. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Random Dropout Regularization (RDR) to exploit the advantages of low-complexity models to alleviate overfitting. In addition, to remedy the lack of high-frequency details for these models, an Edge-guided Splitting Strategy (ESS) is developed. With these two techniques, our method (termed DropoutGS) provides a simple yet effective plug-in approach to improve the generalization performance of existing 3DGS methods. Extensive experiments show that our DropoutGS produces state-of-the-art performance under sparse views on benchmark datasets including Blender, LLFF, and DTU. The project page is at:this https URL.

- **[Infused Suppression Of Magnification Artefacts For Micro-AU Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09326)**  `arXiv:2504.09326`  `cs.CV`  
  _Huai-Qian Khor, Yante Li, Xingxun Jiang, Guoying Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Facial micro-expressions are spontaneous, brief and subtle facial motions that unveil the underlying, suppressed emotions. Detecting Action Units (AUs) in micro-expressions is crucial because it yields a finer representation of facial motions than categorical emotions, effectively resolving the ambiguity among different expressions. One of the difficulties in micro-expression analysis is that facial motions are subtle and brief, thereby increasing the difficulty in correlating facial motion features to AU occurrence. To bridge the subtlety issue, flow-related features and motion magnification are a few common approaches as they can yield descriptive motion changes and increased motion amplitude respectively. While motion magnification can amplify the motion changes, it also accounts for illumination changes and projection errors during the amplification process, thereby creating motion artefacts that confuse the model to learn inauthentic magnified motion features. The problem is further aggravated in the context of a more complicated task where more AU classes are analyzed in cross-database settings. To address this issue, we propose InfuseNet, a layer-wise unitary feature infusion framework that leverages motion context to constrain the Action Unit (AU) learning within an informative facial movement region, thereby alleviating the influence of magnification artefacts. On top of that, we propose leveraging magnified latent features instead of reconstructing magnified samples to limit the distortion and artefacts caused by the projection inaccuracy in the motion reconstruction process. Via alleviating the magnification artefacts, InfuseNet has surpassed the state-of-the-art results in the CD6ME protocol. Further quantitative studies have also demonstrated the efficacy of motion artefacts alleviation.

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful reconstruction technique, but it needs to be initialized from accurate camera poses and high-fidelity point clouds. Typically, the initialization is taken from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithms; however, SfM is time-consuming and restricts the application of 3DGS in real-world scenarios and large-scale scene reconstruction. We introduce a constrained optimization method for simultaneous camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction that does not require SfM support. Core to our approach is decomposing a camera pose into a sequence of camera-to-(device-)center and (device-)center-to-world optimizations. To facilitate, we propose two optimization constraints conditioned to the sensitivity of each parameter group and restricts each parameter's search space. In addition, as we learn the scene geometry directly from the noisy point clouds, we propose geometric constraints to improve the reconstruction quality. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing (multi-modal) 3DGS baseline and methods supplemented by COLMAP on both our collected dataset and two public benchmarks.

  Brain decoding currently faces significant challenges in individual differences, modality alignment, and high-dimensional embeddings. To address individual differences, researchers often use source subject data, which leads to issues such as privacy leakage and heavy data storage burdens. In modality alignment, current works focus on aligning the softmax probability distribution but neglect the alignment of marginal probability distributions, resulting in modality misalignment. Additionally, images and text are aligned separately with fMRI without considering the complex interplay between images and text, leading to poor image reconstruction. Finally, the enormous dimensionality of CLIP embeddings causes significant computational costs. Although the dimensionality of CLIP embeddings can be reduced by ignoring the number of patches obtained from images and the number of tokens acquired from text, this comes at the cost of a significant drop in model performance, creating a dilemma. To overcome these limitations, we propose a source-free domain adaptation-based brain decoding framework

  Reconstructing 3Ds of hand-object interaction (HOI) is a fundamental problem that can find numerous applications. Despite recent advances, there is no comprehensive pipeline yet for bimanual class-agnostic interaction reconstruction from a monocular RGB video, where two hands and an unknown object are interacting with each other. Previous works tackled the limited hand-object interaction case, where object templates are pre-known or only one hand is involved in the interaction. The bimanual interaction reconstruction exhibits severe occlusions introduced by complex interactions between two hands and an object. To solve this, we first introduce BIGS (Bimanual Interaction 3D Gaussian Splatting), a method that reconstructs 3D Gaussians of hands and an unknown object from a monocular video. To robustly obtain object Gaussians avoiding severe occlusions, we leverage prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model with score distillation sampling (SDS) loss, to reconstruct unseen object parts. For hand Gaussians, we exploit the 3D priors of hand model (i.e., MANO) and share a single Gaussian for two hands to effectively accumulate hand 3D information, given limited views. To further consider the 3D alignment between hands and objects, we include the interacting-subjects optimization step during Gaussian optimization. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on two challenging datasets, in terms of 3D hand pose estimation (MPJPE), 3D object reconstruction (CDh, CDo, F10), and rendering quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), respectively.

  The recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable potential in novel view synthesis tasks. The divide-and-conquer paradigm has enabled large-scale scene reconstruction, but significant challenges remain in scene partitioning, optimization, and merging processes. This paper introduces BlockGaussian, a novel framework incorporating a content-aware scene partition strategy and visibility-aware block optimization to achieve efficient and high-quality large-scale scene reconstruction. Specifically, our approach considers the content-complexity variation across different regions and balances computational load during scene partitioning, enabling efficient scene reconstruction. To tackle the supervision mismatch issue during independent block optimization, we introduce auxiliary points during individual block optimization to align the ground-truth supervision, which enhances the reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-view geometry constraint that effectively mitigates rendering degradation caused by airspace floaters during block merging. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction efficiency and rendering quality, with a 5x speedup in optimization and an average PSNR improvement of 1.21 dB on multiple benchmarks. Notably, BlockGaussian significantly reduces computational requirements, enabling large-scale scene reconstruction on a single 24GB VRAM device. The project page is available atthis https URL

  Precise camera localization is a critical task in XR applications and robotics. Using only the camera captures as input to a system is an inexpensive option that enables localization in large indoor and outdoor environments, but it presents challenges in achieving high accuracy. Specifically, camera relocalization methods, such as Absolute Pose Regression (APR), can localize cameras with a median translation error of more than $0.5m$ in outdoor scenes. This paper presents HAL-NeRF, a high-accuracy localization method that combines a CNN pose regressor with a refinement module based on a Monte Carlo particle filter. The Nerfacto model, an implementation of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), is used to augment the data for training the pose regressor and to measure photometric loss in the particle filter refinement module. HAL-NeRF leverages Nerfacto's ability to synthesize high-quality novel views, significantly improving the performance of the localization pipeline. HAL-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results that are conventionally measured as the average of the median per scene errors. The translation error was $0.025m$ and the rotation error was $0.59$ degrees and 0.04m and 0.58 degrees on the 7-Scenes dataset and Cambridge Landmarks datasets respectively, with the trade-off of increased computational time. This work highlights the potential of combining APR with NeRF-based refinement techniques to advance monocular camera relocalization accuracy.

  Reflective and textureless surfaces remain a challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Both camera pose calibration and shape reconstruction often fail due to insufficient or unreliable cross-view visual features. To address these issues, we present PMNI (Pose-free Multi-view Normal Integration), a neural surface reconstruction method that incorporates rich geometric information by leveraging surface normal maps instead of RGB images. By enforcing geometric constraints from surface normals and multi-view shape consistency within a neural signed distance function (SDF) optimization framework, PMNI simultaneously recovers accurate camera poses and high-fidelity surface geometry. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the reconstruction of reflective surfaces, even without reliable initial camera poses.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained model-based continual learning (PTMCL) has garnered growing attention, as it enables more rapid acquisition of new knowledge by leveraging the extensive foundational understanding inherent in pre-trained model (PTM). Most existing PTMCL methods use Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to learn new knowledge while consolidating existing memory. However, they often face some challenges. A major challenge lies in the misalignment of classification heads, as the classification head of each task is trained within a distinct feature space, leading to inconsistent decision boundaries across tasks and, consequently, increased forgetting. Another critical limitation stems from the restricted feature-level knowledge accumulation, with feature learning typically restricted to the initial task only, which constrains the model's representation capabilities. To address these issues, we propose a method named DUal-level Knowledge Accumulation and Ensemble (DUKAE) that leverages both feature-level and decision-level knowledge accumulation by aligning classification heads into a unified feature space through Gaussian distribution sampling and introducing an adaptive expertise ensemble to fuse knowledge across feature subspaces. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, CUB-200, and Cars-196 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach.

  Tracking Any Point (TAP) in a video is a challenging computer vision problem with many demonstrated applications in robotics, video editing, and 3D reconstruction. Existing methods for TAP rely heavily on complex tracking-specific inductive biases and heuristics, limiting their generality and potential for scaling. To address these challenges, we present TAPNext, a new approach that casts TAP as sequential masked token decoding. Our model is causal, tracks in a purely online fashion, and removes tracking-specific inductive biases. This enables TAPNext to run with minimal latency, and removes the temporal windowing required by many existing state of art trackers. Despite its simplicity, TAPNext achieves a new state-of-the-art tracking performance among both online and offline trackers. Finally, we present evidence that many widely used tracking heuristics emerge naturally in TAPNext through end-to-end training. The TAPNext model and code can be found atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Depth estimation is a core problem in robotic perception and vision tasks, but 3D reconstruction from a single image presents inherent uncertainties. Current depth estimation models primarily rely on inter-image relationships for supervised training, often overlooking the intrinsic information provided by the camera itself. We propose a method that embodies the camera model and its physical characteristics into a deep learning model, computing embodied scene depth through real-time interactions with road environments. The model can calculate embodied scene depth in real-time based on immediate environmental changes using only the intrinsic properties of the camera, without any additional equipment. By combining embodied scene depth with RGB image features, the model gains a comprehensive perspective on both geometric and visual details. Additionally, we incorporate text descriptions containing environmental content and depth information as priors for scene understanding, enriching the model's perception of objects. This integration of image and language - two inherently ambiguous modalities - leverages their complementary strengths for monocular depth estimation. The real-time nature of the embodied language and depth prior model ensures that the model can continuously adjust its perception and behavior in dynamic environments. Experimental results show that the embodied depth estimation method enhances model performance across different scenes.

  Depth-guided multimodal fusion combines depth information from visible and infrared images, significantly enhancing the performance of 3D reconstruction and robotics applications. Existing thermal-visible image fusion mainly focuses on detection tasks, ignoring other critical information such as depth. By addressing the limitations of single modalities in low-light and complex environments, the depth information from fused images not only generates more accurate point cloud data, improving the completeness and precision of 3D reconstruction, but also provides comprehensive scene understanding for robot navigation, localization, and environmental perception. This supports precise recognition and efficient operations in applications such as autonomous driving and rescue missions. We introduce a text-guided and depth-driven infrared and visible image fusion network. The model consists of an image fusion branch for extracting multi-channel complementary information through a diffusion model, equipped with a text-guided module, and two auxiliary depth estimation branches. The fusion branch uses CLIP to extract semantic information and parameters from depth-enriched image descriptions to guide the diffusion model in extracting multi-channel features and generating fused images. These fused images are then input into the depth estimation branches to calculate depth-driven loss, optimizing the image fusion network. This framework aims to integrate vision-language and depth to directly generate color-fused images from multimodal inputs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  It remains a significant challenge to compress images at extremely low bitrate while achieving both semantic consistency and high perceptual quality. Inspired by human progressive perception mechanism, we propose a Semantically Disentangled Image Compression framework (SEDIC) in this paper. Initially, an extremely compressed reference image is obtained through a learned image encoder. Then we leverage LMMs to extract essential semantic components, including overall descriptions, object detailed description, and semantic segmentation masks. We propose a training-free Object Restoration model with Attention Guidance (ORAG) built on pre-trained ControlNet to restore object details conditioned by object-level text descriptions and semantic masks. Based on the proposed ORAG, we design a multistage semantic image decoder to progressively restore the details object by object, starting from the extremely compressed reference image, ultimately generating high-quality and high-fidelity reconstructions. Experimental results demonstrate that SEDIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior perceptual quality and semantic consistency at extremely low-bitrates ($\le$ 0.05 bpp).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Perceiving visual scenes as objects and background -- like humans do -- Object-Centric Learning (OCL) aggregates image or video feature maps into object-level feature vectors, termed \textit{slots}. OCL's self-supervision of reconstructing the input from these aggregated slots struggles with complex object textures, thus Vision Foundation Model (VFM) representations are used as the aggregation input and reconstruction target. However, existing methods leverage VFM representations in diverse ways and often fail to fully exploit their potential. In response, we propose a clean architecture -- Vector-Quantized VFMs for OCL (VQ-VFM-OCL, or VVO) -- that unifies mainstream OCL methods. The key to our unification is simple yet effective, just shared quantizing the same VFM representation as the reconstruction target. Through mathematical modeling and statistical verification, we further analyze why VFM representations facilitate OCL aggregation and how their shared quantization as reconstruction targets strengthens OCL supervision. Experiments show that across different VFMs, aggregators and decoders, our VVO consistently outperforms baselines in object discovery and recognition, as well as downstream visual prediction and reasoning.

  3D object removal is an important sub-task in 3D scene editing, with broad applications in scene understanding, augmented reality, and robotics. However, existing methods struggle to achieve a desirable balance among consistency, usability, and computational efficiency in multi-view settings. These limitations are primarily due to unintuitive user interaction in the source view, inefficient multi-view object mask generation, computationally expensive inpainting procedures, and a lack of applicability across different radiance field representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pipeline that improves the quality and efficiency of multi-view object mask generation and inpainting. Our method introduces an intuitive region-based interaction mechanism in the source view and eliminates the need for camera poses or extra model training. Our lightweight HoMM module is employed to achieve high-quality multi-view mask propagation with enhanced efficiency. In the inpainting stage, we further reduce computational costs by performing inpainting only on selected key views and propagating the results to other views via homography-based mapping. Our pipeline is compatible with a variety of radiance field frameworks, including NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, demonstrating improved generalizability and practicality in real-world scenarios. Additionally, we present a new 3D multi-object removal dataset with greater object diversity and viewpoint variation than existing datasets. Experiments on public benchmarks and our proposed dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing runtime to one-fifth of that required by leading baselines.

  Achieving high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging due to the inherent limitations of traditional methods like Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and monocular SLAM in accurately capturing scene details. While differentiable rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) address some of these challenges, their high computational costs make them unsuitable for real-time applications. Additionally, existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods often focus on photometric consistency, neglecting geometric accuracy and failing to exploit SLAM's dynamic depth and pose updates for scene refinement. We propose a framework integrating dense SLAM with 3DGS for real-time, high-fidelity dense reconstruction. Our approach introduces SLAM-Informed Adaptive Densification, which dynamically updates and densifies the Gaussian model by leveraging dense point clouds from SLAM. Additionally, we incorporate Geometry-Guided Optimization, which combines edge-aware geometric constraints and photometric consistency to jointly optimize the appearance and geometry of the 3DGS scene representation, enabling detailed and accurate SLAM mapping reconstruction. Experiments on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results among monocular systems. Specifically, our method achieves a PSNR of 36.864, SSIM of 0.985, and LPIPS of 0.040 on Replica, representing improvements of 10.7%, 6.4%, and 49.4%, respectively, over the previous SOTA. On TUM-RGBD, our method outperforms the closest baseline by 10.2%, 6.6%, and 34.7% in the same metrics. These results highlight the potential of our framework in bridging the gap between photometric and geometric dense 3D scene representations, paving the way for practical and efficient monocular dense reconstruction.

  Recent advances in large reconstruction and generative models have significantly improved scene reconstruction and novel view generation. However, due to compute limitations, each inference with these large models is confined to a small area, making long-range consistent scene generation challenging. To address this, we propose StarGen, a novel framework that employs a pre-trained video diffusion model in an autoregressive manner for long-range scene generation. The generation of each video clip is conditioned on the 3D warping of spatially adjacent images and the temporally overlapping image from previously generated clips, improving spatiotemporal consistency in long-range scene generation with precise pose control. The spatiotemporal condition is compatible with various input conditions, facilitating diverse tasks, including sparse view interpolation, perpetual view generation, and layout-conditioned city generation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate StarGen's superior scalability, fidelity, and pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:this https URL.

  _Siyang Wang, Feng Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative models trained on extensive high-quality datasets effectively capture the structural and statistical properties of clean images, rendering them powerful priors for transforming degraded features into clean ones in image restoration. VAR, a novel image generative paradigm, surpasses diffusion models in generation quality by applying a next-scale prediction approach. It progressively captures both global structures and fine-grained details through the autoregressive process, consistent with the multi-scale restoration principle widely acknowledged in the restoration community. Furthermore, we observe that during the image reconstruction process utilizing VAR, scale predictions automatically modulate the input, facilitating the alignment of representations at subsequent scales with the distribution of clean images. To harness VAR's adaptive distribution alignment capability in image restoration tasks, we formulate the multi-scale latent representations within VAR as the restoration prior, thus advancing our delicately designed VarFormer framework. The strategic application of these priors enables our VarFormer to achieve remarkable generalization on unseen tasks while also reducing training computational costs. Extensive experiments underscores that our VarFormer outperforms existing multi-task image restoration methods across various restoration tasks.

  Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D geometry. While stereo depth estimation can be achieved through triangulation methods, it is not as straightforward for monocular methods, which require the integration of global and local information. The Depth from Defocus (DFD) method utilizes camera lens models and parameters to recover depth information from blurred images and has been proven to perform well. However, these methods rely on All-In-Focus (AIF) images for depth estimation, which is nearly impossible to obtain in real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised framework based on 3D Gaussian splatting and Siamese networks. By learning the blur levels at different focal distances of the same scene in the focal stack, the framework predicts the defocus map and Circle of Confusion (CoC) from a single defocused image, using the defocus map as input to DepthNet for monocular depth estimation. The 3D Gaussian splatting model renders defocused images using the predicted CoC, and the differences between these and the real defocused images provide additional supervision signals for the Siamese Defocus self-supervised network. This framework has been validated on both artificially synthesized and real blurred datasets. Subsequent quantitative and visualization experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework is highly effective as a DFD method.

  Vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) in the medical field utilizes contrastive learning on image-text pairs to achieve effective transfer across tasks. Yet, current VLP approaches with the masked modeling strategy face two challenges when applied to the medical domain. First, current models struggle to accurately reconstruct key pathological features due to the scarcity of medical data. Second, most methods only adopt either paired image-text or image-only data, failing to exploit the combination of both paired and unpaired data. To this end, this paper proposes the MMCLIP (Masked Medical Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) framework to enhance pathological learning and feature learning via unpaired data. First, we introduce the attention-masked image modeling (AttMIM) and entity-driven masked language modeling module (EntMLM), which learns to reconstruct pathological visual and textual tokens via multi-modal feature interaction, thus improving medical-enhanced features. The AttMIM module masks a portion of the image features that are highly responsive to textual features. This allows MMCLIP to improve the reconstruction of highly similar image data in medicine efficiency. Second, our MMCLIP capitalizes unpaired data to enhance multimodal learning by introducing disease-kind prompts. The experimental results show that MMCLIP achieves SOTA for zero-shot and fine-tuning classification performance on five datasets. Our code will be available atthis https URL.

  Monitoring space objects is crucial for space situational awareness, yet reconstructing 3D satellite models from ground-based telescope images is challenging due to atmospheric turbulence, long observation distances, limited viewpoints, and low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we propose a novel computational imaging framework that overcomes these obstacles by integrating a hybrid image pre-processing pipeline with a joint pose estimation and 3D reconstruction module based on controlled Gaussian Splatting (GS) and Branch-and-Bound (BnB) search. We validate our approach on both synthetic satellite datasets and on-sky observations of China's Tiangong Space Station and the International Space Station, achieving robust 3D reconstructions of low-Earth orbit satellites from ground-based data. Quantitative evaluations using SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and Chamfer Distance demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF-based approaches, and ablation studies confirm the critical role of each component. Our framework enables high-fidelity 3D satellite monitoring from Earth, offering a cost-effective alternative for space situational awareness. Project page:this https URL

  Recently, the editing of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) has gained considerable attention, but most prior works focus on static scenes while research on the appearance editing of dynamic scenes is relatively lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to edit the local appearance of dynamic NeRFs by manipulating pixels in a single frame of training video. Specifically, to locally edit the appearance of dynamic NeRFs while preserving unedited regions, we introduce a local surface representation of the edited region, which can be inserted into and rendered along with the original NeRF and warped to arbitrary other frames through a learned invertible motion representation network. By employing our method, users without professional expertise can easily add desired content to the appearance of a dynamic scene. We extensively evaluate our approach on various scenes and show that our approach achieves spatially and temporally consistent editing results. Notably, our approach is versatile and applicable to different variants of dynamic NeRF representations.

  Pretrained masked language models (MLMs) have demonstrated an impressive capability to comprehend and encode conceptual knowledge, revealing a lattice structure among concepts. This raises a critical question: how does this conceptualization emerge from MLM pretraining? In this paper, we explore this problem from the perspective of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), a mathematical framework that derives concept lattices from the observations of object-attribute relationships. We show that the MLM's objective implicitly learns a \emph{formal context} that describes objects, attributes, and their dependencies, which enables the reconstruction of a concept lattice through FCA. We propose a novel framework for concept lattice construction from pretrained MLMs and investigate the origin of the inductive biases of MLMs in lattice structure learning. Our framework differs from previous work because it does not rely on human-defined concepts and allows for discovering "latent" concepts that extend beyond human definitions. We create three datasets for evaluation, and the empirical results verify our hypothesis.

  Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for assisting clinical interviews due to their fluent interactive capabilities and extensive medical knowledge. However, the lack of high-quality interview dialogue data and widely accepted evaluation methods has significantly impeded this process. So we propose CliniChat, a framework that integrates multi-source knowledge to enable LLMs to simulate real-world clinical interviews. It consists of two modules: Clini-Recon and Clini-Eval, each responsible for reconstructing and evaluating interview dialogues, respectively. By incorporating three sources of knowledge, Clini-Recon transforms clinical notes into systematic, professional, and empathetic interview dialogues. Clini-Eval combines a comprehensive evaluation metric system with a two-phase automatic evaluation approach, enabling LLMs to assess interview performance like experts. We contribute MedQA-Dialog, a high-quality synthetic interview dialogue dataset, and CliniChatGLM, a model specialized for clinical interviews. Experimental results demonstrate that CliniChatGLM's interview capabilities undergo a comprehensive upgrade, particularly in history-taking, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

  Scientific diagrams are vital tools for communicating structured knowledge across disciplines. However, they are often published as static raster images, losing symbolic semantics and limiting reuse. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a pathway to bridging vision and structure, existing methods lack semantic control and structural interpretability, especially on complex diagrams. We propose Draw with Thought (DwT), a training-free framework that guides MLLMs to reconstruct diagrams into editable mxGraph XML code through cognitively-grounded Chain-of-Thought reasoning. DwT enables interpretable and controllable outputs without model fine-tuning by dividing the task into two stages: Coarse-to-Fine Planning, which handles perceptual structuring and semantic specification, and Structure-Aware Code Generation, enhanced by format-guided refinement. To support evaluation, we release Plot2XML, a benchmark of 247 real-world scientific diagrams with gold-standard XML annotations. Extensive experiments across eight MLLMs show that our approach yields high-fidelity, semantically aligned, and structurally valid reconstructions, with human evaluations confirming strong alignment in both accuracy and visual aesthetics, offering a scalable solution for converting static visuals into executable representations and advancing machine understanding of scientific graphics.

  Understanding the structure and motion of the heart is crucial for diagnosing and managing cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of global death. There is wide variation in cardiac shape and motion patterns, that are influenced by demographic, anthropometric and disease factors. Unravelling the normal patterns of shape and motion, as well as understanding how each individual deviates from the norm, would facilitate accurate diagnosis and personalised treatment strategies. To this end, we developed a novel conditional generative model, MeshHeart, to learn the distribution of cardiac shape and motion patterns. MeshHeart is capable of generating 3D+t cardiac mesh sequences, taking into account clinical factors such as age, sex, weight and height. To model the high-dimensional and complex spatio-temporal mesh data, MeshHeart employs a geometric encoder to represent cardiac meshes in a latent space, followed by a temporal Transformer to model the motion dynamics of latent representations. Based on MeshHeart, we investigate the latent space of 3D+t cardiac mesh sequences and propose a novel distance metric termed latent delta, which quantifies the deviation of a real heart from its personalised normative pattern in the latent space. In experiments using a large dataset of 38,309 subjects, MeshHeart demonstrates a high performance in cardiac mesh sequence reconstruction and generation. Features defined in the latent space are highly discriminative for cardiac disease classification, whereas the latent delta exhibits strong correlation with clinical phenotypes in phenome-wide association studies. The codes and models of this study will be released to benefit further research on digital heart modelling.
