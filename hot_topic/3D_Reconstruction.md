- **[Noise Fusion-based Distillation Learning for Anomaly Detection in Complex Industrial Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16050)**  `arXiv:2506.16050`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly detection and localization in automated industrial manufacturing can significantly enhance production efficiency and product quality. Existing methods are capable of detecting surface defects in pre-defined or controlled imaging environments. However, accurately detecting workpiece defects in complex and unstructured industrial environments with varying views, poses and illumination remains challenging. We propose a novel anomaly detection and localization method specifically designed to handle inputs with perturbative patterns. Our approach introduces a new framework based on a collaborative distillation heterogeneous teacher network (HetNet), an adaptive local-global feature fusion module, and a local multivariate Gaussian noise generation module. HetNet can learn to model the complex feature distribution of normal patterns using limited information about local disruptive changes. We conducted extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks. HetNet demonstrates superior performance with approximately 10% improvement across all evaluation metrics on MSC-AD under industrial conditions, while achieving state-of-the-art results on other datasets, validating its resilience to environmental fluctuations and its capability to enhance the reliability of industrial anomaly detection systems across diverse scenarios. Tests in real-world environments further confirm that HetNet can be effectively integrated into production lines to achieve robust and real-time anomaly detection.

- **[Semantic and Feature Guided Uncertainty Quantification of Visual Localization for Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15851)**  `arXiv:2506.15851`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  The uncertainty quantification of sensor measurements coupled with deep learning networks is crucial for many robotics systems, especially for safety-critical applications such as self-driving cars. This paper develops an uncertainty quantification approach in the context of visual localization for autonomous driving, where locations are selected based on images. Key to our approach is to learn the measurement uncertainty using light-weight sensor error model, which maps both image feature and semantic information to 2-dimensional error distribution. Our approach enables uncertainty estimation conditioned on the specific context of the matched image pair, implicitly capturing other critical, unannotated factors (e.g., city vs highway, dynamic vs static scenes, winter vs summer) in a latent manner. We demonstrate the accuracy of our uncertainty prediction framework using the Ithaca365 dataset, which includes variations in lighting and weather (sunny, night, snowy). Both the uncertainty quantification of the sensor+network is evaluated, along with Bayesian localization filters using unique sensor gating method. Results show that the measurement error does not follow a Gaussian distribution with poor weather and lighting conditions, and is better predicted by our Gaussian Mixture model.

  Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings. We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and conditions.

- **[An Iterative Task-Driven Framework for Resilient LiDAR Place Recognition in Adverse Weather](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14806)**  `arXiv:2504.14806`  `cs.RO`  
  _Xiongwei Zhao, Xieyuanli Chen, Xu Zhu, Xingxiang Xie, Haojie Bai, Congcong Wen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LiDAR place recognition (LPR) plays a vital role in autonomous navigation. However, existing LPR methods struggle to maintain robustness under adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, and fog, where weather-induced noise and point cloud degradation impair LiDAR reliability and perception accuracy. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Iterative Task-Driven Framework (ITDNet), which integrates a LiDAR Data Restoration (LDR) module and a LiDAR Place Recognition (LPR) module through an iterative learning strategy. These modules are jointly trained end-to-end, with alternating optimization to enhance performance. The core rationale of ITDNet is to leverage the LDR module to recover the corrupted point clouds while preserving structural consistency with clean data, thereby improving LPR accuracy in adverse weather. Simultaneously, the LPR task provides feature pseudo-labels to guide the LDR module's training, aligning it more effectively with the LPR task. To achieve this, we first design a task-driven LPR loss and a reconstruction loss to jointly supervise the optimization of the LDR module. Furthermore, for the LDR module, we propose a Dual-Domain Mixer (DDM) block for frequency-spatial feature fusion and a Semantic-Aware Generator (SAG) block for semantic-guided restoration. In addition, for the LPR module, we introduce a Multi-Frequency Transformer (MFT) block and a Wavelet Pyramid NetVLAD (WPN) block to aggregate multi-scale, robust global descriptors. Finally, extensive experiments on Weather-KITTI, Boreas, and our proposed Weather-Apollo datasets demonstrate that, ITDNet outperforms existing LPR methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in adverse weather.

- **[BASE-Q: Bias and Asymmetric Scaling Enhanced Rotational Quantization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15689)**  `arXiv:2506.15689`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Liulu He, Shenli Zhen, Karwei Sun, Yijiang Liu, Yufei Zhao, Chongkang Tan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rotations have become essential to state-of-the-art quantization pipelines for large language models (LLMs) by effectively smoothing outliers in weights and activations. However, further optimizing the rotation parameters offers only limited performance gains and introduces significant training overhead: due to rotation parameter sharing, full-model must be loaded simultaneously to enable backpropagation, resulting in substantial memory consumption and limited practical utility. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of current rotational quantization methods: (i) rotation fails to align channel means, resulting in wider quantization bounds and increased rounding errors; and (ii) rotation makes the activation distribution more Gaussian-like, increasing energy loss caused by clipping errors. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{BASE-Q}, a simple yet powerful approach that combines bias correction and asymmetric scaling to effectively reduce rounding and clipping errors. Furthermore, BASE-Q enables blockwise optimization, eliminating the need for memory-intensive full-model backpropagation. Extensive experiments on various LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BASE-Q, narrowing the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5\%, 42.9\%, and 29.2\% compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively. The code will be released soon.

- **[Flow-Based Non-stationary Temporal Regime Causal Structure Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17065)**  `arXiv:2506.17065`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Abdellah Rahmani, Pascal Frossard_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is crucial in many scenarios, such as those dealing with financial or neurological data. Many such time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments with a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal structure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for analyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this setting is challenging due to (1) non stationarity, i.e., each regime can have its own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions, which may be non Gaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery approaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity or Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified framework for causal discovery that handles non stationary processes along with non Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the number of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's Directed Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm that maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log likelihood. On the theoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal heteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are identifiable in both stationary and non stationary settings. In addition, extensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that FANTOM outperforms existing methods.

- **[Anomaly Detection in Event-triggered Traffic Time Series via Similarity Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16855)**  `arXiv:2506.16855`  `cs.LG`  
  _Shaoyu Dou, Kai Yang, Yang Jiao, Chengbo Qiu, Kui Ren_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series analysis has achieved great success in cyber security such as intrusion detection and device identification. Learning similarities among multiple time series is a crucial problem since it serves as the foundation for downstream analysis. Due to the complex temporal dynamics of the event-triggered time series, it often remains unclear which similarity metric is appropriate for security-related tasks, such as anomaly detection and clustering. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop an unsupervised learning framework that is capable of learning similarities among a set of event-triggered time series. From the machine learning vantage point, the proposed framework harnesses the power of both hierarchical multi-resolution sequential autoencoders and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to effectively learn the low-dimensional representations from the time series. Finally, the obtained similarity measure can be easily visualized for the explanation. The proposed framework aspires to offer a stepping stone that gives rise to a systematic approach to model and learn similarities among a multitude of event-triggered time series. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, it is revealed that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods considerably.

- **[Robust Group Anomaly Detection for Quasi-Periodic Network Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16815)**  `arXiv:2506.16815`  `cs.LG`  
  _Kai Yang, Shaoyu Dou, Pan Luo, Xin Wang, H. Vincent Poor_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many real-world multivariate time series are collected from a network of physical objects embedded with software, electronics, and sensors. The quasi-periodic signals generated by these objects often follow a similar repetitive and periodic pattern, but have variations in the period, and come in different lengths caused by timing (synchronization) errors. Given a multitude of such quasi-periodic time series, can we build machine learning models to identify those time series that behave differently from the majority of the observations? In addition, can the models help human experts to understand how the decision was made? We propose a sequence to Gaussian Mixture Model (seq2GMM) framework. The overarching goal of this framework is to identify unusual and interesting time series within a network time series database. We further develop a surrogate-based optimization algorithm that can efficiently train the seq2GMM model. Seq2GMM exhibits strong empirical performance on a plurality of public benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques by a significant margin. We also theoretically analyze the convergence property of the proposed training algorithm and provide numerical results to substantiate our theoretical claims.

- **[Bayesian Optimization over Bounded Domains with the Beta Product Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16316)**  `arXiv:2506.16316`  `cs.LG`  
  _Huy Hoang Nguyen, Han Zhou, Matthew B. Blaschko, Aleksei Tiulpin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes (GP) is commonly used to optimize black-box functions. The Mat√©rn and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) covariance functions are used frequently, but they do not make any assumptions about the domain of the function, which may limit their applicability in bounded domains. To address the limitation, we introduce the Beta kernel, a non-stationary kernel induced by a product of Beta distribution density functions. Such a formulation allows our kernel to naturally model functions on bounded domains. We present statistical evidence supporting the hypothesis that the kernel exhibits an exponential eigendecay rate, based on empirical analyses of its spectral properties across different settings. Our experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the Beta kernel in modeling functions with optima located near the faces or vertices of the unit hypercube. The experiments show that our kernel consistently outperforms a wide range of kernels, including the well-known Mat√©rn and RBF, in different problems, including synthetic function optimization and the compression of vision and language models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A key challenge in maximizing the benefits of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in clinical settings is to accelerate acquisition times without significantly degrading image quality. This objective requires a balance between under-sampling the raw k-space measurements for faster acquisitions and gathering sufficient raw information for high-fidelity image reconstruction and analysis tasks. To achieve this balance, we propose to use sequential Bayesian experimental design (BED) to provide an adaptive and task-dependent selection of the most informative measurements. Measurements are sequentially augmented with new samples selected to maximize information gain on a posterior distribution over target images. Selection is performed via a gradient-based optimization of a design parameter that defines a subsampling pattern. In this work, we introduce a new active BED procedure that leverages diffusion-based generative models to handle the high dimensionality of the images and employs stochastic optimization to select among a variety of patterns while meeting the acquisition process constraints and budget. So doing, we show how our setting can optimize, not only standard image reconstruction, but also any associated image analysis task. The versatility and performance of our approach are demonstrated on several MRI acquisitions.

- **[On the Theoretical Understanding of Identifiable Sparse Autoencoders and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15963)**  `arXiv:2506.15963`  `cs.LG`  
  _Jingyi Cui, Qi Zhang, Yifei Wang, Yisen Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting features learned by large language models (LLMs). It aims to recover complex superposed polysemantic features into interpretable monosemantic ones through feature reconstruction via sparsely activated neural networks. Despite the wide applications of SAEs, it remains unclear under what conditions an SAE can fully recover the ground truth monosemantic features from the superposed polysemantic ones. In this paper, through theoretical analysis, we for the first time propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiable SAEs (SAEs that learn unique and ground truth monosemantic features), including 1) extreme sparsity of the ground truth feature, 2) sparse activation of SAEs, and 3) enough hidden dimensions of SAEs. Moreover, when the identifiable conditions are not fully met, we propose a reweighting strategy to improve the identifiability. Specifically, following the theoretically suggested weight selection principle, we prove that the gap between the loss functions of SAE reconstruction and monosemantic feature reconstruction can be narrowed, so that the reweighted SAEs have better reconstruction of the ground truth monosemantic features than the uniformly weighted ones. In experiments, we validate our theoretical findings and show that our weighted SAE significantly improves feature monosemanticity and interpretability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Articulated objects are common in the real world, yet modeling their structure and motion remains a challenging task for 3D reconstruction methods. In this work, we introduce Part$^{2}$GS, a novel framework for modeling articulated digital twins of multi-part objects with high-fidelity geometry and physically consistent articulation. Part$^{2}$GS leverages a part-aware 3D Gaussian representation that encodes articulated components with learnable attributes, enabling structured, disentangled transformations that preserve high-fidelity geometry. To ensure physically consistent motion, we propose a motion-aware canonical representation guided by physics-based constraints, including contact enforcement, velocity consistency, and vector-field alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a field of repel points to prevent part collisions and maintain stable articulation paths, significantly improving motion coherence over baselines. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Part$^{2}$GS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 10$\times$ in Chamfer Distance for movable parts.

- **[CryoCCD: Conditional Cycle-consistent Diffusion with Biophysical Modeling for Cryo-EM Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23444)**  `arXiv:2505.23444`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Runmin Jiang, Genpei Zhang, Yuntian Yang, Siqi Wu, Yuheng Zhang, Wanyue Feng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) offers near-atomic resolution imaging of macromolecules, but developing robust models for downstream analysis is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. While synthetic data generation has emerged as a potential solution, existing methods often fail to capture both the structural diversity of biological specimens and the complex, spatially varying noise inherent in cryo-EM imaging. To overcome these limitations, we propose CryoCCD, a synthesis framework that integrates biophysical modeling with generative techniques. Specifically, CryoCCD produces multi-scale cryo-EM micrographs that reflect realistic biophysical variability through compositional heterogeneity, cellular context, and physics-informed imaging. To generate realistic noise, we employ a conditional diffusion model, enhanced by cycle consistency to preserve structural fidelity and mask-aware contrastive learning to capture spatially adaptive noise patterns. Extensive experiments show that CryoCCD generates structurally accurate micrographs and enhances performance in downstream tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both particle picking and reconstruction.

- **[Representation Learning of Point Cloud Upsampling in Global and Local Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07076)**  `arXiv:2501.07076`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Tongxu Zhang, Bei Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, point cloud upsampling has been widely applied in tasks such as 3D reconstruction and object recognition. This study proposed a novel framework, ReLPU, which enhances upsampling performance by explicitly learning from both global and local structural features of point clouds. Specifically, we extracted global features from uniformly segmented inputs (Average Segments) and local features from patch-based inputs of the same point cloud. These two types of features were processed through parallel autoencoders, fused, and then fed into a shared decoder for upsampling. This dual-input design improved feature completeness and cross-scale consistency, especially in sparse and noisy regions. Our framework was applied to several state-of-the-art autoencoder-based networks and validated on standard datasets. Experimental results demonstrated consistent improvements in geometric fidelity and robustness. In addition, saliency maps confirmed that parallel global-local learning significantly enhanced the interpretability and performance of point cloud upsampling.

- **[Infrared and Visible Image Fusion Based on Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16773)**  `arXiv:2506.16773`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shuchen Sun, Ligen Shi, Chang Liu, Lina Wu, Jun Qiu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Infrared and visible light image fusion aims to combine the strengths of both modalities to generate images that are rich in information and fulfill visual or computational requirements. This paper proposes an image fusion method based on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), referred to as INRFuse. This method parameterizes a continuous function through a neural network to implicitly represent the multimodal information of the image, breaking through the traditional reliance on discrete pixels or explicit features. The normalized spatial coordinates of the infrared and visible light images serve as inputs, and multi-layer perceptrons is utilized to adaptively fuse the features of both modalities, resulting in the output of the fused image. By designing multiple loss functions, the method jointly optimizes the similarity between the fused image and the original images, effectively preserving the thermal radiation information of the infrared image while maintaining the texture details of the visible light image. Furthermore, the resolution-independent characteristic of INR allows for the direct fusion of images with varying resolutions and achieves super-resolution reconstruction through high-density coordinate queries. Experimental results indicate that INRFuse outperforms existing methods in both subjective visual quality and objective evaluation metrics, producing fused images with clear structures, natural details, and rich information without the necessity for a training dataset.

  _Jan Skvrna, Lukas Neumann_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents the winning solution for the S23DR Challenge 2025, which involves predicting a house's 3D roof wireframe from a sparse point cloud and semantic segmentations. Our method operates directly in 3D, first identifying vertex candidates from the COLMAP point cloud using Gestalt segmentations. We then employ two PointNet-like models: one to refine and classify these candidates by analyzing local cubic patches, and a second to predict edges by processing the cylindrical regions connecting vertex pairs. This two-stage, 3D deep learning approach achieved a winning Hybrid Structure Score (HSS) of 0.43 on the private leaderboard.

- **[SynPo: Boosting Training-Free Few-Shot Medical Segmentation via High-Quality Negative Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15153)**  `arXiv:2506.15153`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yufei Liu, Haoke Xiao, Jiaxing Chai, Yongcun Zhang, Rong Wang, Zijie Meng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

- **[Perceptual-GS: Scene-adaptive Perceptual Densification for Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12400)**  `arXiv:2506.12400`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hongbi Zhou, Zhangkai Ni_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for novel view synthesis. However, existing methods struggle to adaptively optimize the distribution of Gaussian primitives based on scene characteristics, making it challenging to balance reconstruction quality and efficiency. Inspired by human perception, we propose scene-adaptive perceptual densification for Gaussian Splatting (Perceptual-GS), a novel framework that integrates perceptual sensitivity into the 3DGS training process to address this challenge. We first introduce a perception-aware representation that models human visual sensitivity while constraining the number of Gaussian primitives. Building on this foundation, we develop a perceptual sensitivity-adaptive distribution to allocate finer Gaussian granularity to visually critical regions, enhancing reconstruction quality and robustness. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets, including BungeeNeRF for large-scale scenes, demonstrate that Perceptual-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction quality, efficiency, and robustness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Genesis, a unified framework for joint generation of multi-view driving videos and LiDAR sequences with spatio-temporal and cross-modal consistency. Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics (FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611), and benefits downstream tasks including segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical utility of the generated data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As a core step in structure-from-motion and SLAM, robust feature detection and description under challenging scenarios such as significant viewpoint changes remain unresolved despite their ubiquity. While recent works have identified the importance of local features in modeling geometric transformations, these methods fail to learn the visual cues present in long-range relationships. We present Robust Deformable Detector (RDD), a novel and robust keypoint detector/descriptor leveraging the deformable transformer, which captures global context and geometric invariance through deformable self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we observed that deformable attention focuses on key locations, effectively reducing the search space complexity and modeling the geometric invariance. Furthermore, we collected an Air-to-Ground dataset for training in addition to the standard MegaDepth dataset. Our proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art keypoint detection/description methods in sparse matching tasks and is also capable of semi-dense matching. To ensure comprehensive evaluation, we introduce two challenging benchmarks: one emphasizing large viewpoint and scale variations, and the other being an Air-to-Ground benchmark -- an evaluation setting that has recently gaining popularity for 3D reconstruction across different altitudes.
