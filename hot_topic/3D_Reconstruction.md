- **[DLBAcalib: Robust Extrinsic Calibration for Non-Overlapping LiDARs Based on Dual LBA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09176)**  `arXiv:2507.09176`  `cs.RO` `cs.CL`

  Accurate extrinsic calibration of multiple LiDARs is crucial for improving the foundational performance of three-dimensional (3D) map reconstruction systems. This paper presents a novel targetless extrinsic calibration framework for multi-LiDAR systems that does not rely on overlapping fields of view or precise initial parameter estimates. Unlike conventional calibration methods that require manual annotations or specific reference patterns, our approach introduces a unified optimization framework by integrating LiDAR bundle adjustment (LBA) optimization with robust iterative refinement. The proposed method constructs an accurate reference point cloud map via continuous scanning from the target LiDAR and sliding-window LiDAR bundle adjustment, while formulating extrinsic calibration as a joint LBA optimization problem. This method effectively mitigates cumulative mapping errors and achieves outlier-resistant parameter estimation through an adaptive weighting mechanism. Extensive evaluations in both the CARLA simulation environment and real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art calibration techniques in both accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that for non-overlapping sensor configurations, our framework achieves an average translational error of 5 mm and a rotational error of 0.2¬∞, with an initial error tolerance of up to 0.4 m/30¬∞. Moreover, the calibration process operates without specialized infrastructure or manual parameter tuning. The code is open source and available on GitHub (\underline{this https URL})

  Visual imitation learning is effective for robots to learn versatile tasks. However, many existing methods rely on behavior cloning with supervised historical trajectories, limiting their 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal awareness. Consequently, these methods struggle to capture the 3D structures and 4D spatiotemporal relationships necessary for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4), a novel visual imitation learning method that incorporates spatiotemporal awareness into diffusion-based policies. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on trajectory cloning, DP4 leverages a dynamic Gaussian world model to guide the learning of 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal perceptions from interactive environments. Our method constructs the current 3D scene from a single-view RGB-D observation and predicts the future 3D scene, optimizing trajectory generation by explicitly modeling both spatial and temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments across 17 simulation tasks with 173 variants and 3 real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that the 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4) outperforms baseline methods, improving the average simulation task success rate by 16.4% (Adroit), 14% (DexArt), and 6.45% (RLBench), and the average real-world robotic task success rate by 8.6%.

  Federated learning enables collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, the rise of federated unlearning, designed to allow clients to erase their data from the global model, introduces new privacy concerns. Specifically, the gradient exchanges during the unlearning process can leak sensitive information about deleted data. In this paper, we introduce DRAGD, a novel attack that exploits gradient discrepancies before and after unlearning to reconstruct forgotten data. We also present DRAGDP, an enhanced version of DRAGD that leverages publicly available prior data to improve reconstruction accuracy, particularly for complex datasets like facial images. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DRAGD and DRAGDP significantly outperform existing methods in datathis http URLwork highlights a critical privacy vulnerability in federated unlearning and offers a practical solution, advancing the security of federated unlearning systems in real-world applications.

- **[Low Resource Reconstruction Attacks Through Benign Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07947)**  `arXiv:2507.07947`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Sol Yarkoni, Roi Livni_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and designed prompts.In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly, benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

- **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790)**  `arXiv:2505.16790`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Hyunjin Seo, Taewon Kim, Sihyun Yu, SungSoo Ahn_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.

- **[Compliance Minimization via Physics-Informed Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09968)**  `arXiv:2507.09968`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently gained significant attention for solving compliance minimization (CM) problems. However, these methods typically provide poor feature boundaries, are very expensive, and lack a systematic mechanism to control the design complexity. Herein, we address these limitations by proposing a mesh-free and simultaneous framework based on physics-informed Gaussian processes (GPs). In our approach, we parameterize the design and state variables with GP priors which have independent kernels but share a multi-output neural network (NN) as their mean function. The architecture of this NN is based on Parametric Grid Convolutional Attention Networks (PGCANs) which not only mitigate spectral bias issues, but also provide an interpretable mechanism to control design complexity. We estimate all the parameters of our GP-based representations by simultaneously minimizing the compliance, total potential energy, and residual of volume fraction constraint. Importantly, our loss function exclude all data-based residuals as GPs automatically satisfy them. We also develop computational schemes based on curriculum training and numerical integration to increase the efficiency and robustness of our approach which is shown to (1) produce super-resolution topologies with fast convergence, (2) achieve smaller compliance and less gray area fraction compared to traditional numerical methods, (3) provide control over fine-scale features, and (4) outperform competing ML-based methods.

- **[Self-Supervised Monocular 4D Scene Reconstruction for Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09145)**  `arXiv:2411.09145`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Chengbo Yuan, Geng Chen, Li Yi, Yang Gao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Egocentric videos provide valuable insights into human interactions with the physical world, which has sparked growing interest in the computer vision and robotics communities. A critical challenge in fully understanding the geometry and dynamics of egocentric videos is dense scene reconstruction. However, the lack of high-quality labeled datasets in this field has hindered the effectiveness of current supervised learning methods. In this work, we aim to address this issue by exploring an self-supervised dynamic scene reconstruction approach. We introduce EgoMono4D, a novel model that unifies the estimation of multiple variables necessary for Egocentric Monocular 4D reconstruction, including camera intrinsic, camera poses, and video depth, all within a fast feed-forward framework. Starting from pretrained single-frame depth and intrinsic estimation model, we extend it with camera poses estimation and align multi-frame results on large-scale unlabeled egocentric videos. We evaluate EgoMono4D in both in-domain and zero-shot generalization settings, achieving superior performance in dense pointclouds sequence reconstruction compared to all baselines. EgoMono4D represents the first attempt to apply self-supervised learning for pointclouds sequence reconstruction to the label-scarce egocentric field, enabling fast, dense, and generalizable reconstruction.

  Visual tokenizers are pivotal in multimodal large models, acting as bridges between continuous inputs and discrete tokens. Nevertheless, training high-compression-rate VQ-VAEs remains computationally demanding, often necessitating thousands of GPU hours. This work demonstrates that a pre-trained VAE can be efficiently transformed into a VQ-VAE by controlling quantization noise within the VAE's tolerance threshold. We present \textbf{Quantize-then-Rectify (ReVQ)}, a framework leveraging pre-trained VAEs to enable rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal computational overhead. By integrating \textbf{channel multi-group quantization} to enlarge codebook capacity and a \textbf{post rectifier} to mitigate quantization errors, ReVQ compresses ImageNet images into at most 512 tokens while sustaining competitive reconstruction quality (rFID = 1.06). Significantly, ReVQ reduces training costs by over two orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art approaches: ReVQ finishes full training on a single NVIDIA 4090 in approximately 22 hours, whereas comparable methods require 4.5 days on 32 A100 GPUs. Experimental results show that ReVQ achieves superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-offs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment, followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability. Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark, outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.

- **[AlphaVAE: Unified End-to-End RGBA Image Reconstruction and Generation with Alpha-Aware Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09308)**  `arXiv:2507.09308`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable results in high-fidelity RGB image synthesis by leveraging pretrained VAEs to compress and reconstruct pixel data at low computational cost. However, the generation of transparent or layered content (RGBA image) remains largely unexplored, due to the lack of large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we propose ALPHA, the first comprehensive RGBA benchmark that adapts standard RGB metrics to four-channel images via alpha blending over canonical backgrounds. We further introduce ALPHAVAE, a unified end-to-end RGBA VAE that extends a pretrained RGB VAE by incorporating a dedicated alpha channel. The model is trained with a composite objective that combines alpha-blended pixel reconstruction, patch-level fidelity, perceptual consistency, and dual KL divergence constraints to ensure latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha representations. Our RGBA VAE, trained on only 8K images in contrast to 1M used by prior methods, achieves a +4.9 dB improvement in PSNR and a +3.2% increase in SSIM over LayerDiffuse in reconstruction. It also enables superior transparent image generation when fine-tuned within a latent diffusion framework. Our code, data, and models are released onthis https URLfor reproducibility.

- **[BayesSDF: Surface-Based Laplacian Uncertainty Estimation for 3D Geometry with Neural Signed Distance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06269)**  `arXiv:2507.06269`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Rushil Desai_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through forests, where precise surface geometry and reliable uncertainty estimates are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) define continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify local surface instability using Hessian-based metrics, enabling efficient, surfaceaware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry, providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency, establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction, simulation, and robotic decision-making.

- **[RefSTAR: Blind Facial Image Restoration with Reference Selection, Transfer, and Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10470)**  `arXiv:2507.10470`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhicun Yin, Junjie Chen, Ming Liu, Zhixin Wang, Fan Li, Renjing Pei, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Blind facial image restoration is highly challenging due to unknown complex degradations and the sensitivity of humans to faces. Although existing methods introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems, mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated. Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance, showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer quality.

- **[Kaleidoscopic Background Attack: Disrupting Pose Estimation with Multi-Fold Radial Symmetry Textures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10265)**  `arXiv:2507.10265`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xinlong Ding, Hongwei Yu, Jiawei Li, Feifan Li, Yu Shang, Bochao Zou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Camera pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task that is essential for applications like visual localization and multi-view stereo reconstruction. In the object-centric scenarios with sparse inputs, the accuracy of pose estimation can be significantly influenced by background textures that occupy major portions of the images across different viewpoints. In light of this, we introduce the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA), which uses identical segments to form discs with multi-fold radial symmetry. These discs maintain high similarity across different viewpoints, enabling effective attacks on pose estimation models even with natural texture segments. Additionally, a projected orientation consistency loss is proposed to optimize the kaleidoscopic segments, leading to significant enhancement in the attack effectiveness. Experimental results show that optimized adversarial kaleidoscopic backgrounds can effectively attack various camera pose estimation models.

  _Chenguo Lin, Yuchen Lin, Panwang Pan, Yifan Yu, Honglei Yan, Katerina Fragkiadaki, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present MoVieS, a novel feed-forward model that synthesizes 4D dynamic novel views from monocular videos in one second. MoVieS represents dynamic 3D scenes using pixel-aligned grids of Gaussian primitives, explicitly supervising their time-varying motion. This allows, for the first time, the unified modeling of appearance, geometry and motion, and enables view synthesis, reconstruction and 3D point tracking within a single learning-based framework. By bridging novel view synthesis with dynamic geometry reconstruction, MoVieS enables large-scale training on diverse datasets with minimal dependence on task-specific supervision. As a result, it also naturally supports a wide range of zero-shot applications, such as scene flow estimation and moving object segmentation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of MoVieS across multiple tasks, achieving competitive performance while offering several orders of magnitude speedups.

- **[Binomial Self-Compensation: Mechanism and Suppression of Motion Error in Phase-Shifting Profilometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10009)**  `arXiv:2507.10009`  `cs.CV`  
  _Geyou Zhang, Kai Liu, Ce Zhu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is widely used in high-precision 3D scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise handling. However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static does not hold in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object motion. To address this challenge, our proposed solution, phase-sequential binomial self-compensation (P-BSC), sums successive motion-affected phase frames weighted by binomial coefficients. This approach exponentially reduces the motion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its efficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation due to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations. Inspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation (I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase frames, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image sequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both limitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show that 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error while achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate equals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high pixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the computational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the computational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster motion error convergence.

  _Junho Lee, Jeongwoo Shin, Hyungwook Choi, Joonseok Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In spite of remarkable potential of the Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in image generation, the desired properties and optimal design of the autoencoders have been underexplored. In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders (LDMAEs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate significantly enhanced image generation quality and computational efficiency.

  _Zhanjiang Yang, Lijun Sun, Jiawei Dong, Xiaoxin An, Yang Liu, Meng Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSI) from RGB images is a cost-effective solution for various vision-based applications. However, most existing learning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the RGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional information. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA, which first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the first stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI datasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the RGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace latent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a direct high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction quality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention, which adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral reconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism ensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an entropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, MCGA, achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code and models will be released atthis https URL

  _Bolun Zheng, Xinjie Liu, Qianyu Zhang, Canjin Wang, Fangni Chen, Mingen Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D hand pose estimation has garnered great attention in recent years due to its critical applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and related fields. The accurate estimation of hand joints is essential for high-quality hand pose estimation. However, existing methods neglect the importance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in predicting hand joints overall and often fail to account for the phenomenon of error accumulation for distal joints in gesture estimation, which can cause certain joints to incur larger errors, resulting in misalignments and artifacts in the pose estimation and degrading the overall reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel segmented architecture for enhanced hand pose estimation (EHPE). We perform local extraction of TIP and wrist, thus alleviating the effect of error accumulation on TIP prediction and further reduce the predictive errors for all joints on this basis. EHPE consists of two key stages: In the TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction stage (TW-stage), the positions of the TIP and wrist joints are estimated to provide an initial accurate joint configuration; In the Prior Guided Joints Estimation stage (PG-stage), a dual-branch interaction network is employed to refine the positions of the remaining joints. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that EHPE achieves state-of-the-arts performance. Code is available atthis https URL.

  _Yiwen Liang, Hui Chen, Yizhe Xiong, Zihan Zhou, Mengyao Lyu, Zijia Lin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts, causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA) method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under challenging real-world distribution shifts.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  An ideal digital telepresence experience requires accurate replication of a person's body, clothing, and movements. To capture and transfer these movements into virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted, which enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without front-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as occlusions and distorted body proportions.There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views, and none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars from a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view datasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a generative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs. Based on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves generalizability.Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree reconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates realistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a Stable Diffusion backbone.Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic frontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables generation of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more accessible and generalizable telepresence systems.

  Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To narrow this gap, we propose MGVQ, a novel method to augment the representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance of existing methods rigorously. MGVQ achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both ImageNet and 8 zero-shot benchmarks across all VQ-VAEs. Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly, with rFID 0.49 v.s. 0.91, and achieve superior PSNR on all zero-shot benchmarks. These results highlight the superiority of MGVQ in reconstruction and pave the way for preserving fidelity in HD image processing tasks. Code will be publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[DNF-Intrinsic: Deterministic Noise-Free Diffusion for Indoor Inverse Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03924)**  `arXiv:2507.03924`  `cs.CV`  
  _Rongjia Zheng, Qing Zhang, Chengjiang Long, Wei-Shi Zheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent methods have shown that pre-trained diffusion models can be fine-tuned to enable generative inverse rendering by learning image-conditioned noise-to-intrinsic mapping. Despite their remarkable progress, they struggle to robustly produce high-quality results as the noise-to-intrinsic paradigm essentially utilizes noisy images with deteriorated structure and appearance for intrinsic prediction, while it is common knowledge that structure and appearance information in an image are crucial for inverse rendering. To address this issue, we present DNF-Intrinsic, a robust yet efficient inverse rendering approach fine-tuned from a pre-trained diffusion model, where we propose to take the source image rather than Gaussian noise as input to directly predict deterministic intrinsic properties via flow matching. Moreover, we design a generative renderer to constrain that the predicted intrinsic properties are physically faithful to the source image. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

  In this paper, we propose Binarized Change Detection (BiCD), the first binary neural network (BNN) designed specifically for change detection. Conventional network binarization approaches, which directly quantize both weights and activations in change detection models, severely limit the network's ability to represent input data and distinguish between changed and unchanged regions. This results in significantly lower detection accuracy compared to real-valued networks. To overcome these challenges, BiCD enhances both the representational power and feature separability of BNNs, improving detection performance. Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary objective based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, guiding the encoder to retain essential input information while promoting better feature discrimination. Since directly computing mutual information under the IB principle is intractable, we design a compact, learnable auxiliary module as an approximation target, leading to a simple yet effective optimization strategy that minimizes both reconstruction loss and standard change detection loss. Extensive experiments on street-view and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that BiCD establishes a new benchmark for BNN-based change detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this domain.

  Existing detectors are often trained on biased datasets, leading to the possibility of overfitting on non-causal image attributes that are spuriously correlated with real/synthetic labels. While these biased features enhance performance on the training data, they result in substantial performance degradation when applied to unbiased datasets. One common solution is to perform dataset alignment through generative reconstruction, matching the semantic content between real and synthetic images. However, we revisit this approach and show that pixel-level alignment alone is insufficient. The reconstructed images still suffer from frequency-level misalignment, which can perpetuate spurious correlations. To illustrate, we observe that reconstruction models tend to restore the high-frequency details lost in real images (possibly due to JPEG compression), inadvertently creating a frequency-level misalignment, where synthetic images appear to have richer high-frequency content than real ones. This misalignment leads to models associating high-frequency features with synthetic labels, further reinforcing biased cues. To resolve this, we propose Dual Data Alignment (DDA), which aligns both the pixel and frequency domains. Moreover, we introduce two new test sets: DDA-COCO, containing DDA-aligned synthetic images for testing detector performance on the most aligned dataset, and EvalGEN, featuring the latest generative models for assessing detectors under new generative architectures such as visual auto-regressive generators. Finally, our extensive evaluations demonstrate that a detector trained exclusively on DDA-aligned MSCOCO could improve across 8 diverse benchmarks by a non-trivial margin, showing a +7.2% on in-the-wild benchmarks, highlighting the improved generalizability of unbiased detectors.

  Recent advances in DUSt3R have enabled robust estimation of dense point clouds and camera parameters of static scenes, leveraging Transformer network architectures and direct supervision on large-scale 3D datasets. In contrast, the limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major bottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model. This constraint has driven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video data with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this work, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient training-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention adaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training or network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently encode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully disentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region segmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our lightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic datasets.

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention due to its high-quality novel view rendering, motivating research to address real-world challenges. A critical issue is the camera motion blur caused by movement during exposure, which hinders accurate 3D scene reconstruction. In this study, we propose CoMoGaussian, a Continuous Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting that reconstructs precise 3D scenes from motion-blurred images while maintaining real-time rendering speed. Considering the complex motion patterns inherent in real-world camera movements, we predict continuous camera trajectories using neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To ensure accurate modeling, we employ rigid body transformations, preserving the shape and size of the object but rely on the discrete integration of sampled frames. To better approximate the continuous nature of motion blur, we introduce a continuous motion refinement (CMR) transformation that refines rigid transformations by incorporating additional learnable parameters. By revisiting fundamental camera theory and leveraging advanced neural ODE techniques, we achieve precise modeling of continuous camera trajectories, leading to improved reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on benchmark datasets, which include a wide range of motion blur scenarios, from moderate to extreme blur.

  Recent advancements in camera-trajectory-guided image-to-video generation offer higher precision and better support for complex camera control compared to text-based approaches. However, they also introduce significant usability challenges, as users often struggle to provide precise camera parameters when working with arbitrary real-world images without knowledge of their depth nor scene scale. To address these real-world application issues, we propose RealCam-I2V, a novel diffusion-based video generation framework that integrates monocular metric depth estimation to establish 3D scene reconstruction in a preprocessing step. During training, the reconstructed 3D scene enables scaling camera parameters from relative to metric scales, ensuring compatibility and scale consistency across diverse real-world images. In inference, RealCam-I2V offers an intuitive interface where users can precisely draw camera trajectories by dragging within the 3D scene. To further enhance precise camera control and scene consistency, we propose scene-constrained noise shaping, which shapes high-level noise and also allows the framework to maintain dynamic and coherent video generation in lower noise stages. RealCam-I2V achieves significant improvements in controllability and video quality on the RealEstate10K and out-of-domain images. We further enables applications like camera-controlled looping video generation and generative frame interpolation. Project page:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image restoration tasks. However, their multi-step denoising process introduces significant computational overhead, limiting their practical deployment. Furthermore, existing methods struggle to effectively remove severe JPEG artifact, especially in highly compressed images. To address these challenges, we propose CODiff, a compression-aware one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal. The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code is released atthis https URL.

  3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) has recently revolutionized novel view synthesis in the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. However, most existing algorithms fail to fully capture the underlying structure, resulting in structural inconsistency. Additionally, they struggle with abrupt appearance variations, leading to inconsistent visual quality. To address these problems, we propose SEGS-SLAM, a structure-enhanced 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM, which achieves high-quality photorealistic mapping. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a structure-enhanced photorealistic mapping (SEPM) framework that, for the first time, leverages highly structured point cloud to initialize structured 3D Gaussians, leading to significant improvements in rendering quality. Second, we propose Appearance-from-Motion embedding (AfME), enabling 3D Gaussians to better model image appearance variations across different camera poses. Extensive experiments on monocular, stereo, and RGB-D datasets demonstrate that SEGS-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in photorealistic mapping quality, e.g., an improvement of $19.86\%$ in PSNR over MonoGS on the TUM RGB-D dataset for monocular cameras.

  3D semantic field learning is crucial for applications like autonomous navigation, AR/VR, and robotics, where accurate comprehension of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints is essential. Existing methods struggle under sparse view conditions, relying on inefficient per-scene multi-view optimizations, which are impractical for many real-world tasks. To address this, we propose SLGaussian, a feed-forward method for constructing 3D semantic fields from sparse viewpoints, allowing direct inference of 3DGS-based scenes. By ensuring consistent SAM segmentations through video tracking and using low-dimensional indexing for high-dimensional CLIP features, SLGaussian efficiently embeds language information in 3D space, offering a robust solution for accurate 3D scene understanding under sparse view conditions. In experiments on two-view sparse 3D object querying and segmentation in the LERF and 3D-OVS datasets, SLGaussian outperforms existing methods in chosen IoU, Localization Accuracy, and mIoU. Moreover, our model achieves scene inference in under 30 seconds and open-vocabulary querying in just 0.011 seconds per query.

  Monocular Depth and Surface Normals Estimation (MDSNE) is crucial for tasks such as 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and underwater exploration. Current methods rely either on discriminative models, which struggle with transparent or reflective surfaces, or generative models, which, while accurate, are computationally expensive. This paper presents a novel deep learning model for MDSNE, specifically tailored for underwater environments, using a hybrid architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Transformers, leveraging the strengths of both approaches. Training effective MDSNE models is often hampered by noisy real-world datasets and the limited generalization of synthetic datasets. To address this, we generate pseudo-labeled real data using multiple pre-trained MDSNE models. To ensure the quality of this data, we propose the Depth Normal Evaluation and Selection Algorithm (DNESA), which evaluates and selects the most reliable pseudo-labeled samples using domain-specific metrics. A lightweight student model is then trained on this curated dataset. Our model reduces parameters by 90% and training costs by 80%, allowing real-time 3D perception on resource-constrained devices. Key contributions include: a novel and efficient MDSNE model, the DNESA algorithm, a domain-specific data pipeline, and a focus on real-time performance and scalability. Designed for real-world underwater applications, our model facilitates low-cost deployments in underwater robots and autonomous vehicles, bridging the gap between research and practical implementation.

  Visual localization refers to the process of determining camera poses and orientation within a known scene representation. This task is often complicated by factors such as changes in illumination and variations in viewing angles. In this paper, we propose HGSLoc, a novel lightweight plug-and-play pose optimization framework, which integrates 3D reconstruction with a heuristic refinement strategy to achieve higher pose estimation accuracy. Specifically, we introduce an explicit geometric map for 3D representation and high-fidelity rendering, allowing the generation of high-quality synthesized views to support accurate visual localization. Our method demonstrates higher localization accuracy compared to NeRF-based neural rendering localization approaches. We introduce a heuristic refinement strategy, its efficient optimization capability can quickly locate the target node, while we set the step level optimization step to enhance the pose accuracy in the scenarios with small errors. With carefully designed heuristic functions, it offers efficient optimization capabilities, enabling rapid error reduction in rough localization estimations. Our method mitigates the dependence on complex neural network models while demonstrating improved robustness against noise and higher localization accuracy in challenging environments, as compared to neural network joint optimization strategies. The optimization framework proposed in this paper introduces novel approaches to visual localization by integrating the advantages of 3D reconstruction and the heuristic refinement strategy, which demonstrates strong performance across multiple benchmark datasets, including 7Scenes and Deep Blending dataset. The implementation of our method has been released atthis https URL.

  The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and hardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration.

  As the number of people affected by diseases in the gastrointestinal system is ever-increasing, a higher demand on preventive screening is inevitable. This will significantly increase the workload on gastroenterologists. To help reduce the workload, tools from computer vision may be helpful. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of constructing 3D models of whole sections of the human colon using image sequences from wireless capsule endoscope video, providing enhanced viewing for gastroenterologists. As capsule endoscope images contain distortion and artifacts non-ideal for many 3D reconstruction algorithms, the problem is challenging. However, recent developments of virtual graphics-based models of the human gastrointestinal system, where distortion and artifacts can be enabled or disabled, makes it possible to ``dissect'' the problem. The graphical model also provides a ground truth, enabling computation of geometric distortion introduced by the 3D reconstruction method. In this paper, most distortions and artifacts are left out to determine if it is feasible to reconstruct whole sections of the human gastrointestinal system by existing methods. We demonstrate that 3D reconstruction is possible using simultaneous localization and mapping. Further, to reconstruct the gastrointestinal wall surface from resulting point clouds, varying greatly in density, Poisson surface reconstruction is a good option. The results are promising, encouraging further research on this problem.

  Discrete diffusion language models learn to reconstruct text from randomly masked inputs, yet under mild assumptions their denoiser already implements the exact Bayesian posterior over the original tokens. We prove that the expected denoiser output under the forward corruption distribution recovers the true posterior, and that a simple Monte Carlo estimator converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)) with finite-sample concentration bounds. Building on this insight, we introduce an inference-time ensemble that runs K independent denoising passes and aggregates both posterior means and variances without any extra training. On WikiText-2, our MC-marginal sampler recovers the analytic lambda-DCE zero-shot perplexity (approximately 39) to within a few points at K=128, and its per-token variance shows a strong rank correlation with reconstruction error (Spearman rho = 0.996). This cost-proportional procedure yields calibrated uncertainty estimates and a direct trade-off between compute and posterior fidelity in discrete diffusion LMs.

  Recent representation learning approaches enhance neural topic models by optimizing the weighted linear combination of the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the log-likelihood and the contrastive learning objective that contrasts pairs of input documents. However, document-level contrastive learning might capture low-level mutual information, such as word ratio, which disturbs topic modeling. Moreover, there is a potential conflict between the ELBO loss that memorizes input details for better reconstruction quality, and the contrastive loss which attempts to learn topic representations that generalize among input documents. To address these issues, we first introduce a novel contrastive learning method oriented towards sets of topic vectors to capture useful semantics that are shared among a set of input documents. Secondly, we explicitly cast contrastive topic modeling as a gradient-based multi-objective optimization problem, with the goal of achieving a Pareto stationary solution that balances the trade-off between the ELBO and the contrastive objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently produces higher-performing neural topic models in terms of topic coherence, topic diversity, and downstream performance.

  Gradient Inversion Attacks invert the transmitted gradients in Federated Learning (FL) systems to reconstruct the sensitive data of local clients and have raised considerable privacy concerns. A majority of gradient inversion methods rely heavily on explicit prior knowledge (e.g., a well pre-trained generative model), which is often unavailable in realistic scenarios. This is because real-world client data distributions are often highly heterogeneous, domain-specific, and unavailable to attackers, making it impractical for attackers to obtain perfectly matched pre-trained models, which inevitably suffer from fundamental distribution shifts relative to target private data. To alleviate this issue, researchers have proposed to leverage the implicit prior knowledge of an over-parameterized network. However, they only utilize a fixed neural architecture for all the attack settings. This would hinder the adaptive use of implicit architectural priors and consequently limit the generalizability. In this paper, we further exploit such implicit prior knowledge by proposing Gradient Inversion via Neural Architecture Search (GI-NAS), which adaptively searches the network and captures the implicit priors behind neural architectures. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed GI-NAS can achieve superior attack performance compared to state-of-the-art gradient inversion methods, even under more practical settings with high-resolution images, large-sized batches, and advanced defense strategies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully introduce NAS to the gradient inversion community. We believe that this work exposes critical vulnerabilities in real-world federated learning by demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction of sensitive data without requiring domain-specific priors, forcing urgent reassessment of FL privacy safeguards.
