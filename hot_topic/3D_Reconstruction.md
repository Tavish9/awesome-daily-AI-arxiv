- **[Well2Flow: Reconstruction of reservoir states from sparse wells using score-based generative models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06305)**  `arXiv:2504.06305`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study investigates the use of score-based generative models for reservoir simulation, with a focus on reconstructing spatially varying permeability and saturation fields in saline aquifers, inferred from sparse observations at two well locations. By modeling the joint distribution of permeability and saturation derived from high-fidelity reservoir simulations, the proposed neural network is trained to learn the complex spatiotemporal dynamics governing multiphase fluid flow in porous media. During inference, the framework effectively reconstructs both permeability and saturation fields by conditioning on sparse vertical profiles extracted from well log data. This approach introduces a novel methodology for incorporating physical constraints and well log guidance into generative models, significantly enhancing the accuracy and physical plausibility of the reconstructed subsurface states. Furthermore, the framework demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across varying geological scenarios, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in data-scarce reservoir management tasks.

- **[PiSSA: Principal Singular Values and Singular Vectors Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02948)**  `arXiv:2404.02948`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  To parameter-efficiently fine-tune (PEFT) large language models (LLMs), the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method approximates the model changes $\Delta W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ through the product of two matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$, where $r \ll \min(m, n)$, $A$ is initialized with Gaussian noise, and $B$ with zeros. LoRA freezes the original model $W$ and updates the "Noise & Zero" adapter, which may lead to slow convergence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Principal Singular values and Singular vectors Adaptation (PiSSA). PiSSA shares the same architecture as LoRA, but initializes the adaptor matrices $A$ and $B$ with the principal components of the original matrix $W$, and put the remaining components into a residual matrix $W^{res} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ which is frozen during fine-tuning. Compared to LoRA, PiSSA updates the principal components while freezing the "residual" parts, allowing faster convergence and enhanced performance. Comparative experiments of PiSSA and LoRA across 12 different models, ranging from 184M to 70B, encompassing 5 NLG and 8 NLU tasks, reveal that PiSSA consistently outperforms LoRA under identical experimental setups. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with PiSSA achieves an accuracy of 72.86%, surpassing LoRA's 67.7% by 5.16%. Due to the same architecture, PiSSA is also compatible with quantization to further reduce the memory requirement of fine-tuning. Compared to QLoRA, QPiSSA exhibits smaller quantization errors in the initial stages. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3-70B on GSM8K, QPiSSA attains an accuracy of 86.05%, exceeding the performances of QLoRA at 81.73%. Leveraging a fast SVD technique, PiSSA can be initialized in only a few seconds, presenting a negligible cost for transitioning from LoRA to PiSSA. Code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Robust and Noise-resilient Long-Term Prediction of Spatiotemporal Data Using Variational Mode Graph Neural Networks with 3D Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06660)**  `arXiv:2504.06660`  `cs.LG`  
  _Osama Ahmad, Zubair Khalid_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper focuses on improving the robustness of spatiotemporal long-term prediction using a variational mode graph convolutional network (VMGCN) by introducing 3D channel attention. The deep learning network for this task relies on historical data inputs, yet real-time data can be corrupted by sensor noise, altering its distribution. We model this noise as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise and incorporate it into the LargeST traffic volume dataset, resulting in data with both inherent and additive noise components. Our approach involves decomposing the corrupted signal into modes using variational mode decomposition, followed by feeding the data into a learning pipeline for prediction. We integrate a 3D attention mechanism encompassing spatial, temporal, and channel attention. The spatial and temporal attention modules learn their respective correlations, while the channel attention mechanism is used to suppress noise and highlight the significant modes in the spatiotemporal signals. Additionally, a learnable soft thresholding method is implemented to exclude unimportant modes from the feature vector, and a feature reduction method based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is applied. We compare the performance of our approach against baseline models, demonstrating that our method achieves superior long-term prediction accuracy, robustness to noise, and improved performance with mode truncation compared to the baseline models.

  Game State Reconstruction (GSR), a critical task in Sports Video Understanding, involves precise tracking and localization of all individuals on the football field-players, goalkeepers, referees, and others - in real-world coordinates. This capability enables coaches and analysts to derive actionable insights into player movements, team formations, and game dynamics, ultimately optimizing training strategies and enhancing competitive advantage. Achieving accurate GSR using a single-camera setup is highly challenging due to frequent camera movements, occlusions, and dynamic scene content. In this work, we present a robust end-to-end pipeline for tracking players across an entire match using a single-camera setup. Our solution integrates a fine-tuned YOLOv5m for object detection, a SegFormer-based camera parameter estimator, and a DeepSORT-based tracking framework enhanced with re-identification, orientation prediction, and jersey number recognition. By ensuring both spatial accuracy and temporal consistency, our method delivers state-of-the-art game state reconstruction, securing first place in the SoccerNet Game State Reconstruction Challenge 2024 and significantly outperforming competing methods.

- **[Compressing 3D Gaussian Splatting by Noise-Substituted Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03059)**  `arXiv:2504.03059`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Haishan Wang, Mohammad Hassan Vali, Arno Solin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in 3D reconstruction, achieving high-quality results with real-time radiance field rendering. However, a key challenge is the substantial storage cost: reconstructing a single scene typically requires millions of Gaussian splats, each represented by 59 floating-point parameters, resulting in approximately 1 GB of memory. To address this challenge, we propose a compression method by building separate attribute codebooks and storing only discrete code indices. Specifically, we employ noise-substituted vector quantization technique to jointly train the codebooks and model features, ensuring consistency between gradient descent optimization and parameter discretization. Our method reduces the memory consumption efficiently (around $45\times$) while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality on standard 3D benchmark scenes. Experiments on different codebook sizes show the trade-off between compression ratio and image quality. Furthermore, the trained compressed model remains fully compatible with popular 3DGS viewers and enables faster rendering speed, making it well-suited for practical applications.

- **[Glossy Object Reconstruction with Cost-effective Polarized Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07025)**  `arXiv:2504.07025`  `cs.CV`  
  _Bojian Wu, Yifan Peng, Ruizhen Hu, Xiaowei Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The challenge of image-based 3D reconstruction for glossy objects lies in separating diffuse and specular components on glossy surfaces from captured images, a task complicated by the ambiguity in discerning lighting conditions and material properties using RGB data alone. While state-of-the-art methods rely on tailored and/or high-end equipment for data acquisition, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming, this work introduces a scalable polarization-aided approach that employs cost-effective acquisition tools. By attaching a linear polarizer to readily available RGB cameras, multi-view polarization images can be captured without the need for advance calibration or precise measurements of the polarizer angle, substantially reducing system construction costs. The proposed approach represents polarimetric BRDF, Stokes vectors, and polarization states of object surfaces as neural implicit fields. These fields, combined with the polarizer angle, are retrieved by optimizing the rendering loss of input polarized images. By leveraging fundamental physical principles for the implicit representation of polarization rendering, our method demonstrates superiority over existing techniques through experiments in public datasets and real captured images on both reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

  3D human digitization has long been a highly pursued yet challenging task. Existing methods aim to generate high-quality 3D digital humans from single or multiple views, but remain primarily constrained by current paradigms and the scarcity of 3D human assets. Specifically, recent approaches fall into several paradigms: optimization-based and feed-forward (both single-view regression and multi-view generation with reconstruction). However, they are limited by slow speed, low quality, cascade reasoning, and ambiguity in mapping low-dimensional planes to high-dimensional space due to occlusion and invisibility, respectively. Furthermore, existing 3D human assets remain small-scale, insufficient for large-scale training. To address these challenges, we propose a latent space generation paradigm for 3D human digitization, which involves compressing multi-view images into Gaussians via a UV-structured VAE, along with DiT-based conditional generation, we transform the ill-posed low-to-high-dimensional mapping problem into a learnable distribution shift, which also supports end-to-end inference. In addition, we employ the multi-view optimization approach combined with synthetic data to construct the HGS-1M dataset, which contains $1$ million 3D Gaussian assets to support the large-scale training. Experimental results demonstrate that our paradigm, powered by large-scale training, produces high-quality 3D human Gaussians with intricate textures, facial details, and loose clothing deformation.

- **[IAAO: Interactive Affordance Learning for Articulated Objects in 3D Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06827)**  `arXiv:2504.06827`  `cs.CV`  
  _Can Zhang, Gim Hee Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work presents IAAO, a novel framework that builds an explicit 3D model for intelligent agents to gain understanding of articulated objects in their environment through interaction. Unlike prior methods that rely on task-specific networks and assumptions about movable parts, our IAAO leverages large foundation models to estimate interactive affordances and part articulations in three stages. We first build hierarchical features and label fields for each object state using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by distilling mask features and view-consistent labels from multi-view images. We then perform object- and part-level queries on the 3D Gaussian primitives to identify static and articulated elements, estimating global transformations and local articulation parameters along with affordances. Finally, scenes from different states are merged and refined based on the estimated transformations, enabling robust affordance-based interaction and manipulation of objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

- **[SVG-IR: Spatially-Varying Gaussian Splatting for Inverse Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06815)**  `arXiv:2504.06815`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hanxiao Sun, YuPeng Gao, Jin Xie, Jian Yang, Beibei Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing 3D assets from images, known as inverse rendering (IR), remains a challenging task due to its ill-posed nature. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities for novel view synthesis (NVS) tasks. Methods apply it to relighting by separating radiance into BRDF parameters and lighting, yet produce inferior relighting quality with artifacts and unnatural indirect illumination due to the limited capability of each Gaussian, which has constant material parameters and normal, alongside the absence of physical constraints for indirect lighting. In this paper, we present a novel framework called Spatially-vayring Gaussian Inverse Rendering (SVG-IR), aimed at enhancing both NVS and relighting quality. To this end, we propose a new representation-Spatially-varying Gaussian (SVG)-that allows per-Gaussian spatially varying parameters. This enhanced representation is complemented by a SVG splatting scheme akin to vertex/fragment shading in traditional graphics pipelines. Furthermore, we integrate a physically-based indirect lighting model, enabling more realistic relighting. The proposed SVG-IR framework significantly improves rendering quality, outperforming state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods by 2.5 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and surpassing existing Gaussian-based techniques by 3.5 dB in relighting tasks, all while maintaining a real-time rendering speed.

- **[GSta: Efficient Training Scheme with Siestaed Gaussians for Monocular 3D Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06716)**  `arXiv:2504.06716`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Gaussian Splatting (GS) is a popular approach for 3D reconstruction, mostly due to its ability to converge reasonably fast, faithfully represent the scene and render (novel) views in a fast fashion. However, it suffers from large storage and memory requirements, and its training speed still lags behind the hash-grid based radiance field approaches (e.g. Instant-NGP), which makes it especially difficult to deploy them in robotics scenarios, where 3D reconstruction is crucial for accurate operation. In this paper, we propose GSta that dynamically identifies Gaussians that have converged well during training, based on their positional and color gradient norms. By forcing such Gaussians into a siesta and stopping their updates (freezing) during training, we improve training speed with competitive accuracy compared to state of the art. We also propose an early stopping mechanism based on the PSNR values computed on a subset of training images. Combined with other improvements, such as integrating a learning rate scheduler, GSta achieves an improved Pareto front in convergence speed, memory and storage requirements, while preserving quality. We also show that GSta can improve other methods and complement orthogonal approaches in efficiency improvement; once combined with Trick-GS, GSta achieves up to 5x faster training, 16x smaller disk size compared to vanilla GS, while having comparable accuracy and consuming only half the peak memory.

- **[InstantSticker: Realistic Decal Blending via Disentangled Object Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06620)**  `arXiv:2504.06620`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yi Zhang, Xiaoyang Huang, Yishun Dou, Yue Shi, Rui Shi, Ye Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present InstantSticker, a disentangled reconstruction pipeline based on Image-Based Lighting (IBL), which focuses on highly realistic decal blending, simulates stickers attached to the reconstructed surface, and allows for instant editing and real-time rendering. To achieve stereoscopic impression of the decal, we introduce shadow factor into IBL, which can be adaptively optimized during training. This allows the shadow brightness of surfaces to be accurately decomposed rather than baked into the diffuse color, ensuring that the edited texture exhibits authentic shading. To address the issues of warping and blurriness in previous methods, we apply As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) parameterization to pre-unfold a specified area of the mesh and use the local UV mapping combined with a neural texture map to enhance the ability to express high-frequency details in that area. For instant editing, we utilize the Disney BRDF model, explicitly defining material colors with 3-channel diffuse albedo. This enables instant replacement of albedo RGB values during the editing process, avoiding the prolonged optimization required in previous approaches. In our experiment, we introduce the Ratio Variance Warping (RVW) metric to evaluate the local geometric warping of the decal area. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses previous decal blending methods in terms of editing quality, editing speed and rendering speed, achieving the state-of-the-art.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained model-based continual learning (PTMCL) has garnered growing attention, as it enables more rapid acquisition of new knowledge by leveraging the extensive foundational understanding inherent in pre-trained model (PTM). Most existing PTMCL methods use Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to learn new knowledge while consolidating existing memory. However, they often face some challenges. A major challenge lies in the misalignment of classification heads, as the classification head of each task is trained within a distinct feature space, leading to inconsistent decision boundaries across tasks and, consequently, increased forgetting. Another critical limitation stems from the restricted feature-level knowledge accumulation, with feature learning typically restricted to the initial task only, which constrains the model's representation capabilities. To address these issues, we propose a method named DUal-level Knowledge Accumulation and Ensemble (DUKAE) that leverages both feature-level and decision-level knowledge accumulation by aligning classification heads into a unified feature space through Gaussian distribution sampling and introducing an adaptive expertise ensemble to fuse knowledge across featurethis http URLexperiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, CUB-200, and Cars-196 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach.

- **[FIORD: A Fisheye Indoor-Outdoor Dataset with LIDAR Ground Truth for 3D Scene Reconstruction and Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01732)**  `arXiv:2504.01732`  `cs.CV`

  The development of large-scale 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis methods mostly rely on datasets comprising perspective images with narrow fields of view (FoV). While effective for small-scale scenes, these datasets require large image sets and extensive structure-from-motion (SfM) processing, limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce a fisheye image dataset tailored for scene reconstruction tasks. Using dual 200-degree fisheye lenses, our dataset provides full 360-degree coverage of 5 indoor and 5 outdoor scenes. Each scene has sparse SfM point clouds and precise LIDAR-derived dense point clouds that can be used as geometric ground-truth, enabling robust benchmarking under challenging conditions such as occlusions and reflections. While the baseline experiments focus on vanilla Gaussian Splatting and NeRF based Nerfacto methods, the dataset supports diverse approaches for scene reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and image-based rendering.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a significant advancement in 3D scene reconstruction, attracting considerable attention due to its ability to recover high-fidelity details while maintaining low complexity. Despite the promising results achieved by 3DGS, its rendering performance is constrained by its dependence on costly non-commutative alpha-blending operations. These operations mandate complex view dependent sorting operations that introduce computational overhead, especially on the resource-constrained platforms such as mobile phones. In this paper, we propose Weighted Sum Rendering, which approximates alpha blending with weighted sums, thereby removing the need for sorting. This simplifies implementation, delivers superior performance, and eliminates the "popping" artifacts caused by sorting. Experimental results show that optimizing a generalized Gaussian splatting formulation to the new differentiable rendering yields competitive image quality. The method was implemented and tested in a mobile device GPU, achieving on average $1.23\times$ faster rendering.

  Using the latent diffusion model has proven effective in developing novel 3D generation techniques. To harness the latent diffusion model, a key challenge is designing a high-fidelity and efficient representation that links the latent space and the 3D space. In this paper, we introduce Atlas Gaussians, a novel representation for feed-forward native 3D generation. Atlas Gaussians represent a shape as the union of local patches, and each patch can decode 3D Gaussians. We parameterize a patch as a sequence of feature vectors and design a learnable function to decode 3D Gaussians from the feature vectors. In this process, we incorporate UV-based sampling, enabling the generation of a sufficiently large, and theoretically infinite, number of 3D Gaussian points. The large amount of 3D Gaussians enables the generation of high-quality details. Moreover, due to local awareness of the representation, the transformer-based decoding procedure operates on a patch level, ensuring efficiency. We train a variational autoencoder to learn the Atlas Gaussians representation, and then apply a latent diffusion model on its latent space for learning 3D Generation. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the prior arts of feed-forward native 3D generation. Project page:this https URL.
