- **[Belief Roadmaps with Uncertain Landmark Evanescence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17982)**  `arXiv:2501.17982`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  We would like a robot to navigate to a goal location while minimizing state uncertainty. To aid the robot in this endeavor, maps provide a prior belief over the location of objects and regions of interest. To localize itself within the map, a robot identifies mapped landmarks using its sensors. However, as the time between map creation and robot deployment increases, portions of the map can become stale, and landmarks, once believed to be permanent, may disappear. We refer to the propensity of a landmark to disappear as landmark evanescence. Reasoning about landmark evanescence during path planning, and the associated impact on localization accuracy, requires analyzing the presence or absence of each landmark, leading to an exponential number of possible outcomes of a given motion plan. To address this complexity, we develop BRULE, an extension of the Belief Roadmap. During planning, we replace the belief over future robot poses with a Gaussian mixture which is able to capture the effects of landmark evanescence. Furthermore, we show that belief updates can be made efficient, and that maintaining a random subset of mixture components is sufficient to find high quality solutions. We demonstrate performance in simulated and real-world experiments. Software is available atthis https URL.

- **[Optimized Lattice-Structured Flexible EIT Sensor for Tactile Reconstruction and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00161)**  `arXiv:2505.00161`  `cs.RO`  
  _Huazhi Dong, Sihao Teng, Xu Han, Xiaopeng Wu, Francesco Giorgio-Serchi, Yunjie Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flexible electrical impedance tomography (EIT) offers a promising alternative to traditional tactile sensing approaches, enabling low-cost, scalable, and deformable sensor designs. Here, we propose an optimized lattice-structured flexible EIT tactile sensor incorporating a hydrogel-based conductive layer, systematically designed through three-dimensional coupling field simulations to optimize structural parameters for enhanced sensitivity and robustness. By tuning the lattice channel width and conductive layer thickness, we achieve significant improvements in tactile reconstruction quality and classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate high-quality tactile reconstruction with correlation coefficients up to 0.9275, peak signal-to-noise ratios reaching 29.0303 dB, and structural similarity indexes up to 0.9660, while maintaining low relative errors down to 0.3798. Furthermore, the optimized sensor accurately classifies 12 distinct tactile stimuli with an accuracy reaching 99.6%. These results highlight the potential of simulation-guided structural optimization for advancing flexible EIT-based tactile sensors toward practical applications in wearable systems, robotics, and human-machine interfaces.

- **[PRISM-DP: Spatial Pose-based Observations for Diffusion-Policies via Segmentation, Mesh Generation, and Pose Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20359)**  `arXiv:2504.20359`  `cs.RO`  
  _Xiatao Sun, Yinxing Chen, Daniel Rakita_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based visuomotor policies generate robot motions by learning to denoise action-space trajectories conditioned on observations. These observations are commonly streams of RGB images, whose high dimensionality includes substantial task-irrelevant information, requiring large models to extract relevant patterns. In contrast, using more structured observations, such as the spatial poses (positions and orientations) of key objects over time, enables training more compact policies that can recognize relevant patterns with fewer parameters. However, obtaining accurate object poses in open-set, real-world environments remains challenging. For instance, it is impractical to assume that all relevant objects are equipped with markers, and recent learning-based 6D pose estimation and tracking methods often depend on pre-scanned object meshes, requiring manual reconstruction. In this work, we propose PRISM-DP, an approach that leverages segmentation, mesh generation, pose estimation, and pose tracking models to enable compact diffusion policy learning directly from the spatial poses of task-relevant objects. Crucially, because PRISM-DP uses a mesh generation model, it eliminates the need for manual mesh processing or creation, improving scalability and usability in open-set, real-world environments. Experiments across a range of tasks in both simulation and real-world settings show that PRISM-DP outperforms high-dimensional image-based diffusion policies and achieves performance comparable to policies trained with ground-truth state information. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications and limitations of our approach.

- **[Gaussian Mixture Flow Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05304)**  `arXiv:2504.05304`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Hansheng Chen, Kai Zhang, Hao Tan, Zexiang Xu, Fujun Luan, Leonidas Guibas, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models approximate the denoising distribution as a Gaussian and predict its mean, whereas flow matching models reparameterize the Gaussian mean as flow velocity. However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an $L_2$ denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256$\times$256.

- **[Variational Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04318)**  `arXiv:2504.04318`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Mehmet Can Yavuz, Berrin Yanikoglu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Variational Self-Supervised Learning (VSSL), a novel framework that combines variational inference with self-supervised learning to enable efficient, decoder-free representation learning. Unlike traditional VAEs that rely on input reconstruction via a decoder, VSSL symmetrically couples two encoders with Gaussian outputs. A momentum-updated teacher network defines a dynamic, data-dependent prior, while the student encoder produces an approximate posterior from augmented views. The reconstruction term in the ELBO is replaced with a cross-view denoising objective, preserving the analytical tractability of Gaussian KL divergence. We further introduce cosine-based formulations of KL and log-likelihood terms to enhance semantic alignment in high-dimensional latent spaces. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 show that VSSL achieves competitive or superior performance to leading self-supervised methods, including BYOL and MoCo V3. VSSL offers a scalable, probabilistically grounded approach to learning transferable representations without generative reconstruction, bridging the gap between variational modeling and modern self-supervised techniques.

- **[Empirical Evaluation of Progressive Coding for Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00190)**  `arXiv:2505.00190`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Hans Peter, Anders S√∏gaard_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) \citep{bricken2023monosemanticity,gao2024scalingevaluatingsparseautoencoders} rely on dictionary learning to extract interpretable features from neural networks at scale in an unsupervised manner, with applications to representation engineering and information retrieval. SAEs are, however, computationally expensive \citep{lieberum2024gemmascopeopensparse}, especially when multiple SAEs of different sizes are needed. We show that dictionary importance in vanilla SAEs follows a power law. We compare progressive coding based on subset pruning of SAEs -- to jointly training nested SAEs, or so-called {\em Matryoshka} SAEs \citep{bussmann2024learning,nabeshima2024Matryoshka} -- on a language modeling task. We show Matryoshka SAEs exhibit lower reconstruction loss and recaptured language modeling loss, as well as higher representational similarity. Pruned vanilla SAEs are more interpretable, however. We discuss the origins and implications of this trade-off.

- **[On the Importance of Gaussianizing Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00685)**  `arXiv:2505.00685`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The normal distribution plays a central role in information theory - it is at the same time the best-case signal and worst-case noise distribution, has the greatest representational capacity of any distribution, and offers an equivalence between uncorrelatedness and independence for joint distributions. Accounting for the mean and variance of activations throughout the layers of deep neural networks has had a significant effect on facilitating their effective training, but seldom has a prescription for precisely what distribution these activations should take, and how this might be achieved, been offered. Motivated by the information-theoretic properties of the normal distribution, we address this question and concurrently present normality normalization: a novel normalization layer which encourages normality in the feature representations of neural networks using the power transform and employs additive Gaussian noise during training. Our experiments comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of normality normalization, in regards to its generalization performance on an array of widely used model and dataset combinations, its strong performance across various common factors of variation such as model width, depth, and training minibatch size, its suitability for usage wherever existing normalization layers are conventionally used, and as a means to improving model robustness to random perturbations.

- **[Quaternion Wavelet-Conditioned Diffusion Models for Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00334)**  `arXiv:2505.00334`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Luigi Sigillo, Christian Bianchi, Danilo Comminiello_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image Super-Resolution is a fundamental problem in computer vision with broad applications spacing from medical imaging to satellite analysis. The ability to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs is crucial for enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation. While deep learning has significantly advanced SR, achieving high-quality reconstructions with fine-grained details and realistic textures remains challenging, particularly at high upscaling factors. Recent approaches leveraging diffusion models have demonstrated promising results, yet they often struggle to balance perceptual quality with structural fidelity. In this work, we introduce ResQu a novel SR framework that integrates a quaternion wavelet preprocessing framework with latent diffusion models, incorporating a new quaternion wavelet- and time-aware encoder. Unlike prior methods that simply apply wavelet transforms within diffusion models, our approach enhances the conditioning process by exploiting quaternion wavelet embeddings, which are dynamically integrated at different stages of denoising. Furthermore, we also leverage the generative priors of foundation models such as Stable Diffusion. Extensive experiments on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding SR results, outperforming in many cases existing approaches in perceptual quality and standard evaluation metrics. The code will be available after the revision process.

- **[Direct Motion Models for Assessing Generated Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00209)**  `arXiv:2505.00209`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Kelsey Allen, Carl Doersch, Guangyao Zhou, Mohammed Suhail, Danny Driess, Ignacio Rocco, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A current limitation of video generative video models is that they generate plausible looking frames, but poor motion -- an issue that is not well captured by FVD and other popular methods for evaluating generated videos. Here we go beyond FVD by developing a metric which better measures plausible object interactions and motion. Our novel approach is based on auto-encoding point tracks and yields motion features that can be used to not only compare distributions of videos (as few as one generated and one ground truth, or as many as two datasets), but also for evaluating motion of single videos. We show that using point tracks instead of pixel reconstruction or action recognition features results in a metric which is markedly more sensitive to temporal distortions in synthetic data, and can predict human evaluations of temporal consistency and realism in generated videos obtained from open-source models better than a wide range of alternatives. We also show that by using a point track representation, we can spatiotemporally localize generative video inconsistencies, providing extra interpretability of generated video errors relative to prior work.

- **[Pixel3DMM: Versatile Screen-Space Priors for Single-Image 3D Face Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00615)**  `arXiv:2505.00615`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We address the 3D reconstruction of human faces from a single RGB image. To this end, we propose Pixel3DMM, a set of highly-generalized vision transformers which predict per-pixel geometric cues in order to constrain the optimization of a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). We exploit the latent features of the DINO foundation model, and introduce a tailored surface normal and uv-coordinate prediction head. We train our model by registering three high-quality 3D face datasets against the FLAME mesh topology, which results in a total of over 1,000 identities and 976K images. For 3D face reconstruction, we propose a FLAME fitting opitmization that solves for the 3DMM parameters from the uv-coordinate and normal estimates. To evaluate our method, we introduce a new benchmark for single-image face reconstruction, which features high diversity facial expressions, viewing angles, and ethnicities. Crucially, our benchmark is the first to evaluate both posed and neutral facial geometry. Ultimately, our method outperforms the most competitive baselines by over 15% in terms of geometric accuracy for posed facial expressions.

- **[KeySync: A Robust Approach for Leakage-free Lip Synchronization in High Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00497)**  `arXiv:2505.00497`  `cs.CV`  
  _Antoni Bigata, Rodrigo Mira, Stella Bounareli, Micha≈Ç Stypu≈Çkowski, Konstantinos Vougioukas, Stavros Petridis, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Lip synchronization, known as the task of aligning lip movements in an existing video with new input audio, is typically framed as a simpler variant of audio-driven facial animation. However, as well as suffering from the usual issues in talking head generation (e.g., temporal consistency), lip synchronization presents significant new challenges such as expression leakage from the input video and facial occlusions, which can severely impact real-world applications like automated dubbing, but are often neglected in existing works. To address these shortcomings, we present KeySync, a two-stage framework that succeeds in solving the issue of temporal consistency, while also incorporating solutions for leakage and occlusions using a carefully designed masking strategy. We show that KeySync achieves state-of-the-art results in lip reconstruction and cross-synchronization, improving visual quality and reducing expression leakage according to LipLeak, our novel leakage metric. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new masking approach in handling occlusions and validate our architectural choices through several ablation studies.

- **[Ouroboros3D: Image-to-3D Generation via 3D-aware Recursive Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03184)**  `arXiv:2406.03184`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hao Wen, Zehuan Huang, Yaohui Wang, Xinyuan Chen, Lu Sheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing single image-to-3D creation methods typically involve a two-stage process, first generating multi-view images, and then using these images for 3D reconstruction. However, training these two stages separately leads to significant data bias in the inference phase, thus affecting the quality of reconstructed results. We introduce a unified 3D generation framework, named Ouroboros3D, which integrates diffusion-based multi-view image generation and 3D reconstruction into a recursive diffusion process. In our framework, these two modules are jointly trained through a self-conditioning mechanism, allowing them to adapt to each other's characteristics for robust inference. During the multi-view denoising process, the multi-view diffusion model uses the 3D-aware maps rendered by the reconstruction module at the previous timestep as additional conditions. The recursive diffusion framework with 3D-aware feedback unites the entire process and improves geometricthis http URLshow that our framework outperforms separation of these two stages and existing methods that combine them at the inference phase.

- **[VecFontSDF: Learning to Reconstruct and Synthesize High-quality Vector Fonts via Signed Distance Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12675)**  `arXiv:2303.12675`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zeqing Xia, Bojun Xiong, Zhouhui Lian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Font design is of vital importance in the digital content design and modern printing industry. Developing algorithms capable of automatically synthesizing vector fonts can significantly facilitate the font design process. However, existing methods mainly concentrate on raster image generation, and only a few approaches can directly synthesize vector fonts. This paper proposes an end-to-end trainable method, VecFontSDF, to reconstruct and synthesize high-quality vector fonts using signed distance functions (SDFs). Specifically, based on the proposed SDF-based implicit shape representation, VecFontSDF learns to model each glyph as shape primitives enclosed by several parabolic curves, which can be precisely converted to quadratic B√©zier curves that are widely used in vector font products. In this manner, most image generation methods can be easily extended to synthesize vector fonts. Qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on a publicly-available dataset demonstrate that our method obtains high-quality results on several tasks, including vector font reconstruction, interpolation, and few-shot vector font synthesis, markedly outperforming the state of the art. Our code and trained models are available atthis https URL.

- **[From Attention to Atoms: Spectral Dictionary Learning for Fast, Interpretable Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00033)**  `arXiv:2505.00033`  `cs.CL`  
  _Andrew Kiruluta_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel spectral generative modeling framework for natural language processing that jointly learns a global time varying Fourier dictionary and per token mixing coefficients, replacing the ubiquitous self attention mechanism in transformer architectures. By enforcing reconstruction losses in both the time domain (embedding reconstruction) and the frequency domain (via Short Time Fourier Transform magnitude matching) alongside a standard language modeling objective, and fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) prior over the learned mixing vectors, our approach achieves competitive perplexity and generation quality on standard benchmarks such as WikiText2 and Penn Treebank. In contrast to the quadratic computation complexity of self attention, our method operates with linear complexity, delivering substantial efficiency gains. We demonstrate that spectral dictionary models can achieve competitive performance compared to transformer baselines while significantly reducing inference latency and memory footprint, offering a compelling alternative for scalable language modeling.
