- **[ASHiTA: Automatic Scene-grounded HIerarchical Task Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06553)**  `arXiv:2504.06553`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  While recent work in scene reconstruction and understanding has made strides in grounding natural language to physical 3D environments, it is still challenging to ground abstract, high-level instructions to a 3D scene. High-level instructions might not explicitly invoke semantic elements in the scene, and even the process of breaking a high-level task into a set of more concrete subtasks, a process called hierarchical task analysis, is environment-dependent. In this work, we propose ASHiTA, the first framework that generates a task hierarchy grounded to a 3D scene graph by breaking down high-level tasks into grounded subtasks. ASHiTA alternates LLM-assisted hierarchical task analysis, to generate the task breakdown, with task-driven 3D scene graph construction to generate a suitable representation of the environment. Our experiments show that ASHiTA performs significantly better than LLM baselines in breaking down high-level tasks into environment-dependent subtasks and is additionally able to achieve grounding performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

- **[Multi-head Ensemble of Smoothed Classifiers for Certified Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10882)**  `arXiv:2211.10882`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`

  Randomized Smoothing (RS) is a promising technique for certified robustness, and recently in RS the ensemble of multiple Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has shown state-of-the-art performances due to its variance reduction effect over Gaussian noises. However, such an ensemble brings heavy computation burdens in both training and certification, and yet under-exploits individual DNNs and their mutual effects, as the communication between these classifiers is commonly ignored in optimization. In this work, we consider a novel ensemble-based training way for a single DNN with multiple augmented heads, named as SmOothed Multi-head Ensemble (SOME). In SOME, similar to the pursuit of variance reduction via ensemble, an ensemble of multiple heads imposed with a cosine constraint inside a single DNN is employed with much cheaper training and certification computation overloads in RS. In such network structure, an associated training strategy is designed by introducing a circular communication flow among those augmented heads. That is, each head teaches its neighbor with the self-paced learning strategy using smoothed losses, which are specifically designed in relation to certified robustness. The deployed multi-head structure and the circular-teaching scheme in SOME jointly contribute to the diversities among multiple heads and benefit their ensemble, leading to a competitively stronger certifiably-robust RS-based defense than ensembling multiple DNNs (effectiveness) at the cost of much less computational expenses (efficiency), verified by extensive experiments and discussions.

- **[SN-LiDAR: Semantic Neural Fields for Novel Space-time View LiDAR Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08361)**  `arXiv:2504.08361`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`

  Recent research has begun exploring novel view synthesis (NVS) for LiDAR point clouds, aiming to generate realistic LiDAR scans from unseen viewpoints. However, most existing approaches do not reconstruct semantic labels, which are crucial for many downstream applications such as autonomous driving and robotic perception. Unlike images, which benefit from powerful segmentation models, LiDAR point clouds lack such large-scale pre-trained models, making semantic annotation time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose SN-LiDAR, a method that jointly performs accurate semantic segmentation, high-quality geometric reconstruction, and realistic LiDAR synthesis. Specifically, we employ a coarse-to-fine planar-grid feature representation to extract global features from multi-frame point clouds and leverage a CNN-based encoder to extract local semantic features from the current frame point cloud. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and KITTI-360 demonstrate the superiority of SN-LiDAR in both semantic and geometric reconstruction, effectively handling dynamic objects and large-scale scenes.

- **[WF-VAE: Enhancing Video VAE by Wavelet-Driven Energy Flow for Latent Video Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17459)**  `arXiv:2411.17459`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Zongjian Li, Bin Lin, Yang Ye, Liuhan Chen, Xinhua Cheng, Shenghai Yuan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly, we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache, which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. Our code and models are available atthis https URL.

- **[GigaTok: Scaling Visual Tokenizers to 3 Billion Parameters for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08736)**  `arXiv:2504.08736`  `cs.CV`  
  _Tianwei Xiong, Jun Hao Liew, Zilong Huang, Jiashi Feng, Xihui Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In autoregressive (AR) image generation, visual tokenizers compress images into compact discrete latent tokens, enabling efficient training of downstream autoregressive models for visual generation via next-token prediction. While scaling visual tokenizers improves image reconstruction quality, it often degrades downstream generation quality -- a challenge not adequately addressed in existing literature. To address this, we introduce GigaTok, the first approach to simultaneously improve image reconstruction, generation, and representation learning when scaling visual tokenizers. We identify the growing complexity of latent space as the key factor behind the reconstruction vs. generation dilemma. To mitigate this, we propose semantic regularization, which aligns tokenizer features with semantically consistent features from a pre-trained visual encoder. This constraint prevents excessive latent space complexity during scaling, yielding consistent improvements in both reconstruction and downstream autoregressive generation. Building on semantic regularization, we explore three key practices for scaling tokenizers:(1) using 1D tokenizers for better scalability, (2) prioritizing decoder scaling when expanding both encoder and decoder, and (3) employing entropy loss to stabilize training for billion-scale tokenizers. By scaling to $\bf{3 \space billion}$ parameters, GigaTok achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction, downstream AR generation, and downstream AR representation quality.

- **[X2BR: High-Fidelity 3D Bone Reconstruction from a Planar X-Ray Image with Hybrid Neural Implicit Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08675)**  `arXiv:2504.08675`  `cs.CV`  
  _Gokce Guven, H. Fatih Ugurdag, Hasan F. Ates_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate 3D bone reconstruction from a single planar X-ray remains a challenge due to anatomical complexity and limited input data. We propose X2BR, a hybrid neural implicit framework that combines continuous volumetric reconstruction with template-guided non-rigid registration. The core network, X2B, employs a ConvNeXt-based encoder to extract spatial features from X-rays and predict high-fidelity 3D bone occupancy fields without relying on statistical shape models. To further refine anatomical accuracy, X2BR integrates a patient-specific template mesh, constructed using YOLOv9-based detection and the SKEL biomechanical skeleton model. The coarse reconstruction is aligned to the template using geodesic-based coherent point drift, enabling anatomically consistent 3D bone volumes. Experimental results on a clinical dataset show that X2B achieves the highest numerical accuracy, with an IoU of 0.952 and Chamfer-L1 distance of 0.005, outperforming recent baselines including X2V and D2IM-Net. Building on this, X2BR incorporates anatomical priors via YOLOv9-based bone detection and biomechanical template alignment, leading to reconstructions that, while slightly lower in IoU (0.875), offer superior anatomical realism, especially in rib curvature and vertebral alignment. This numerical accuracy vs. visual consistency trade-off between X2B and X2BR highlights the value of hybrid frameworks for clinically relevant 3D reconstructions.

- **[Latent Diffusion Autoencoders: Toward Efficient and Meaningful Unsupervised Representation Learning in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08635)**  `arXiv:2504.08635`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study presents Latent Diffusion Autoencoder (LDAE), a novel encoder-decoder diffusion-based framework for efficient and meaningful unsupervised learning in medical imaging, focusing on Alzheimer disease (AD) using brain MR from the ADNI database as a case study. Unlike conventional diffusion autoencoders operating in image space, LDAE applies the diffusion process in a compressed latent representation, improving computational efficiency and making 3D medical imaging representation learning tractable. To validate the proposed approach, we explore two key hypotheses: (i) LDAE effectively captures meaningful semantic representations on 3D brain MR associated with AD and ageing, and (ii) LDAE achieves high-quality image generation and reconstruction while being computationally efficient. Experimental results support both hypotheses: (i) linear-probe evaluations demonstrate promising diagnostic performance for AD (ROC-AUC: 90%, ACC: 84%) and age prediction (MAE: 4.1 years, RMSE: 5.2 years); (ii) the learned semantic representations enable attribute manipulation, yielding anatomically plausible modifications; (iii) semantic interpolation experiments show strong reconstruction of missing scans, with SSIM of 0.969 (MSE: 0.0019) for a 6-month gap. Even for longer gaps (24 months), the model maintains robust performance (SSIM > 0.93, MSE < 0.004), indicating an ability to capture temporal progression trends; (iv) compared to conventional diffusion autoencoders, LDAE significantly increases inference throughput (20x faster) while also enhancing reconstruction quality. These findings position LDAE as a promising framework for scalable medical imaging applications, with the potential to serve as a foundation model for medical image analysis.

- **[FMLGS: Fast Multilevel Language Embedded Gaussians for Part-level Interactive Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08581)**  `arXiv:2504.08581`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xin Tan, Yuzhou Ji, He Zhu, Yuan Xie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The semantically interactive radiance field has long been a promising backbone for 3D real-world applications, such as embodied AI to achieve scene understanding and manipulation. However, multi-granularity interaction remains a challenging task due to the ambiguity of language and degraded quality when it comes to queries upon object components. In this work, we present FMLGS, an approach that supports part-level open-vocabulary query within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We propose an efficient pipeline for building and querying consistent object- and part-level semantics based on Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). We designed a semantic deviation strategy to solve the problem of language ambiguity among object parts, which interpolates the semantic features of fine-grained targets for enriched information. Once trained, we can query both objects and their describable parts using natural language. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods prove that our method can not only better locate specified part-level targets, but also achieve first-place performance concerning both speed and accuracy, where FMLGS is 98 x faster than LERF, 4 x faster than LangSplat and 2.5 x faster than LEGaussians. Meanwhile, we further integrate FMLGS as a virtual agent that can interactively navigate through 3D scenes, locate targets, and respond to user demands through a chat interface, which demonstrates the potential of our work to be further expanded and applied in the future.

- **[Cut-and-Splat: Leveraging Gaussian Splatting for Synthetic Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08473)**  `arXiv:2504.08473`  `cs.CV`  
  _Bram Vanherle, Brent Zoomers, Jeroen Put, Frank Van Reeth, Nick Michiels_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating synthetic images is a useful method for cheaply obtaining labeled data for training computer vision models. However, obtaining accurate 3D models of relevant objects is necessary, and the resulting images often have a gap in realism due to challenges in simulating lighting effects and camera artifacts. We propose using the novel view synthesis method called Gaussian Splatting to address these challenges. We have developed a synthetic data pipeline for generating high-quality context-aware instance segmentation training data for specific objects. This process is fully automated, requiring only a video of the target object. We train a Gaussian Splatting model of the target object and automatically extract the object from the video. Leveraging Gaussian Splatting, we then render the object on a random background image, and monocular depth estimation is employed to place the object in a believable pose. We introduce a novel dataset to validate our approach and show superior performance over other data generation approaches, such as Cut-and-Paste and Diffusion model-based generation.

- **[SARFormer -- An Acquisition Parameter Aware Vision Transformer for Synthetic Aperture Radar Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08441)**  `arXiv:2504.08441`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jonathan Prexl, Michael Recla, Michael Schmitt_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This manuscript introduces SARFormer, a modified Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture designed for processing one or multiple synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Given the complex image geometry of SAR data, we propose an acquisition parameter encoding module that significantly guides the learning process, especially in the case of multiple images, leading to improved performance on downstream tasks. We further explore self-supervised pre-training, conduct experiments with limited labeled data, and benchmark our contribution and adaptations thoroughly in ablation experiments against a baseline, where the model is tested on tasks such as height reconstruction and segmentation. Our approach achieves up to 17% improvement in terms of RMSE over baseline models

- **[GeoTexBuild: 3D Building Model Generation from Map Footprints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08419)**  `arXiv:2504.08419`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ruizhe Wang, Junyan Yang, Qiao Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce GeoTexBuild, a modular generative framework for creating 3D building models from map footprints. The proposed framework employs a three-stage process comprising height map generation, geometry reconstruction, and appearance stylization, culminating in building models with intricate geometry and appearance attributes. By integrating customized ControlNet and Text2Mesh models, we explore effective methods for controlling both geometric and visual attributes during the generation process. By this, we eliminate the problem of structural variations behind a single facade photo of the existing 3D generation techniques. Experimental results at each stage validate the capability of GeoTexBuild to generate detailed and accurate building models from footprints derived from site planning or map designs. Our framework significantly reduces manual labor in modeling buildings and can offer inspiration for designers.

- **[PMNI: Pose-free Multi-view Normal Integration for Reflective and Textureless Surface Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08410)**  `arXiv:2504.08410`  `cs.CV`  
  _Mingzhi Pei, Xu Cao, Xiangyi Wang, Heng Guo, Zhanyu Ma_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reflective and textureless surfaces remain a challenge in multi-view 3Dthis http URLcamera pose calibration and shape reconstruction often fail due to insufficient or unreliable cross-view visual features. To address these issues, we present PMNI (Pose-free Multi-view Normal Integration), a neural surface reconstruction method that incorporates rich geometric information by leveraging surface normal maps instead of RGB images. By enforcing geometric constraints from surface normals and multi-view shape consistency within a neural signed distance function (SDF) optimization framework, PMNI simultaneously recovers accurate camera poses and high-fidelity surface geometry. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the reconstruction of reflective surfaces, even without reliable initial camera poses.

- **[Stereophotoclinometry Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08252)**  `arXiv:2504.08252`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image-based surface reconstruction and characterization is crucial for missions to small celestial bodies, as it informs mission planning, navigation, and scientific analysis. However, current state-of-the-practice methods, such as stereophotoclinometry (SPC), rely heavily on human-in-the-loop verification and high-fidelity a priori information. This paper proposes Photoclinometry-from-Motion (PhoMo), a novel framework that incorporates photoclinometry techniques into a keypoint-based structure-from-motion (SfM) system to estimate the surface normal and albedo at detected landmarks to improve autonomous surface and shape characterization of small celestial bodies from in-situ imagery. In contrast to SPC, we forego the expensive maplet estimation step and instead use dense keypoint measurements and correspondences from an autonomous keypoint detection and matching method based on deep learning. Moreover, we develop a factor graph-based approach allowing for simultaneous optimization of the spacecraft's pose, landmark positions, Sun-relative direction, and surface normals and albedos via fusion of Sun vector measurements and image keypoint measurements. The proposed framework is validated on real imagery taken by the Dawn mission to the asteroid 4 Vesta and the minor planet 1 Ceres and compared against an SPC reconstruction, where we demonstrate superior rendering performance compared to an SPC solution and precise alignment to a stereophotogrammetry (SPG) solution without relying on any a priori camera pose and topography information or humans-in-the-loop.

  Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provides a new framework for novel view synthesis, and has spiked a new wave of research in neural rendering and related applications. As 3DGS is becoming a foundational component of many models, any improvement on 3DGS itself can bring huge benefits. To this end, we aim to improve the fundamental paradigm and formulation of 3DGS. We argue that as an unnormalized mixture model, it needs to be neither Gaussians nor splatting. We subsequently propose a new mixture model consisting of flexible Student's t distributions, with both positive (splatting) and negative (scooping) densities. We name our model Student Splatting and Scooping, or SSS. When providing better expressivity, SSS also poses new challenges in learning. Therefore, we also propose a new principled sampling approach for optimization. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, across multiple datasets, settings, and metrics, we demonstrate that SSS outperforms existing methods in terms of quality and parameter efficiency, e.g. achieving matching or better quality with similar numbers of components, and obtaining comparable results while reducing the component number by as much as 82%.

- **[Mixture of Gaussian-distributed Prototypes with Generative Modelling for Interpretable and Trustworthy Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00092)**  `arXiv:2312.00092`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chong Wang, Yuanhong Chen, Fengbei Liu, Yuyuan Liu, Davis James McCarthy, Helen Frazer, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prototypical-part methods, e.g., ProtoPNet, enhance interpretability in image recognition by linking predictions to training prototypes, thereby offering intuitive insights into their decision-making. Existing methods, which rely on a point-based learning of prototypes, typically face two critical issues: 1) the learned prototypes have limited representation power and are not suitable to detect Out-of-Distribution (OoD) inputs, reducing their decision trustworthiness; and 2) the necessary projection of the learned prototypes back into the space of training images causes a drastic degradation in the predictive performance. Furthermore, current prototype learning adopts an aggressive approach that considers only the most active object parts during training, while overlooking sub-salient object regions which still hold crucial classification information. In this paper, we present a new generative paradigm to learn prototype distributions, termed as Mixture of Gaussian-distributed Prototypes (MGProto). The distribution of prototypes from MGProto enables both interpretable image classification and trustworthy recognition of OoD inputs. The optimisation of MGProto naturally projects the learned prototype distributions back into the training image space, thereby addressing the performance degradation caused by prototype projection. Additionally, we develop a novel and effective prototype mining strategy that considers not only the most active but also sub-salient object parts. To promote model compactness, we further propose to prune MGProto by removing prototypes with low importance priors. Experiments on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, Stanford Dogs, and Oxford-IIIT Pets datasets show that MGProto achieves state-of-the-art image recognition and OoD detection performances, while providing encouraging interpretability results.
