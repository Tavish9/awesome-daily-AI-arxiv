- **[PIN-WM: Learning Physics-INformed World Models for Non-Prehensile Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16693)**  `arXiv:2504.16693`  `cs.LG` `cs.RO`

  While non-prehensile manipulation (e.g., controlled pushing/poking) constitutes a foundational robotic skill, its learning remains challenging due to the high sensitivity to complex physical interactions involving friction and restitution. To achieve robust policy learning and generalization, we opt to learn a world model of the 3D rigid body dynamics involved in non-prehensile manipulations and use it for model-based reinforcement learning. We propose PIN-WM, a Physics-INformed World Model that enables efficient end-to-end identification of a 3D rigid body dynamical system from visual observations. Adopting differentiable physics simulation, PIN-WM can be learned with only few-shot and task-agnostic physical interaction trajectories. Further, PIN-WM is learned with observational loss induced by Gaussian Splatting without needing state estimation. To bridge Sim2Real gaps, we turn the learned PIN-WM into a group of Digital Cousins via physics-aware randomizations which perturb physics and rendering parameters to generate diverse and meaningful variations of the PIN-WM. Extensive evaluations on both simulation and real-world tests demonstrate that PIN-WM, enhanced with physics-aware digital cousins, facilitates learning robust non-prehensile manipulation skills with Sim2Real transfer, surpassing the Real2Sim2Real state-of-the-arts.

  As deep learning continues to advance, the transparency of neural network decision-making remains a critical challenge, limiting trust and applicability in high-stakes domains. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) techniques have emerged as a key approach toward visualizing model decisions, yet existing methods face inherent trade-offs. Gradient-based CAM variants suffer from sensitivity to gradient perturbations due to gradient noise, leading to unstable and unreliable explanations. Conversely, gradient-free approaches mitigate gradient instability but incur significant computational overhead and inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose a Cluster Filter Class Activation Map (CF-CAM) technique, a novel framework that reintroduces gradient-based weighting while enhancing robustness against gradient noise. CF-CAM utilizes hierarchical importance weighting strategy to balance discriminative feature preservation and noise elimination. A density-aware channel clustering method via Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) groups semantically relevant feature channels and discard noise-prone activations. Additionally, cluster-conditioned gradient filtering leverages Gaussian filters to refine gradient signals, preserving edge-aware localization while suppressing noise impact. Experiment results demonstrate that CF-CAM achieves superior interpretability performance while enhancing computational efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art CAM methods in faithfulness and robustness. By effectively mitigating gradient instability without excessive computational cost, CF-CAM provides a competitive solution for enhancing the interpretability of deep neural networks in critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis.

- **[Shape Your Ground: Refining Road Surfaces Beyond Planar Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16103)**  `arXiv:2504.16103`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Oussema Dhaouadi, Johannes Meier, Jacques Kaiser, Daniel Cremers_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Road surface reconstruction from aerial images is fundamental for autonomous driving, urban planning, and virtual simulation, where smoothness, compactness, and accuracy are critical quality factors. Existing reconstruction methods often produce artifacts and inconsistencies that limit usability, while downstream tasks have a tendency to represent roads as planes for simplicity but at the cost of accuracy. We introduce FlexRoad, the first framework to directly address road surface smoothing by fitting Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) surfaces to 3D road points obtained from photogrammetric reconstructions or geodata providers. Our method at its core utilizes the Elevation-Constrained Spatial Road Clustering (ECSRC) algorithm for robust anomaly correction, significantly reducing surface roughness and fitting errors. To facilitate quantitative comparison between road surface reconstruction methods, we present GeoRoad Dataset (GeRoD), a diverse collection of road surface and terrain profiles derived from openly accessible geodata. Experiments on GeRoD and the photogrammetry-based DeepScenario Open 3D Dataset (DSC3D) demonstrate that FlexRoad considerably surpasses commonly used road surface representations across various metrics while being insensitive to various input sources, terrains, and noise types. By performing ablation studies, we identify the key role of each component towards high-quality reconstruction performance, making FlexRoad a generic method for realistic road surface modeling.

- **[Semantic Segmentation and Scene Reconstruction of RGB-D Image Frames: An End-to-End Modular Pipeline for Robotic Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17988)**  `arXiv:2410.17988`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Zhiwu Zheng, Lauren Mentzer, Berk Iskender, Michael Price, Colm Prendergast, Audren Cloitre_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robots operating in unstructured environments require a comprehensive understanding of their surroundings, necessitating geometric and semantic information from sensor data. Traditional RGB-D processing pipelines focus primarily on geometric reconstruction, limiting their ability to support advanced robotic perception, planning, and interaction. A key challenge is the lack of generalized methods for segmenting RGB-D data into semantically meaningful components while maintaining accurate geometric representations. We introduce a novel end-to-end modular pipeline that integrates state-of-the-art semantic segmentation, human tracking, point-cloud fusion, and scene reconstruction. Our approach improves semantic segmentation accuracy by leveraging the foundational segmentation model SAM2 with a hybrid method that combines its mask generation with a semantic classification model, resulting in sharper masks and high classification accuracy. Compared to SegFormer and OneFormer, our method achieves a similar semantic segmentation accuracy (mIoU of 47.0% vs 45.9% in the ADE20K dataset) but provides much more precise object boundaries. Additionally, our human tracking algorithm interacts with the segmentation enabling continuous tracking even when objects leave and re-enter the frame by object re-identification. Our point cloud fusion approach reduces computation time by 1.81x while maintaining a small mean reconstruction error of 25.3 mm by leveraging the semantic information. We validate our approach on benchmark datasets and real-world Kinect RGB-D data, demonstrating improved efficiency, accuracy, and usability. Our structured representation, stored in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, supports efficient querying, visualization, and robotic simulation, making it practical for real-world deployment.

- **[Federated EndoViT: Pretraining Vision Transformers via Federated Learning on Endoscopic Image Collections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16612)**  `arXiv:2504.16612`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Max Kirchner, Alexander C. Jenke, Sebastian Bodenstedt, Fiona R. Kolbinger, Oliver Saldanha, Jakob N. Kather, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Purpose: In this study, we investigate the training of foundation models using federated learning to address data-sharing limitations and enable collaborative model training without data transfer for minimally invasive surgery. Methods: Inspired by the EndoViT study, we adapt the Masked Autoencoder for federated learning, enhancing it with adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FedSAM) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA). Our model is pretrained on the Endo700k dataset collection and later fine-tuned and evaluated for tasks such as Semantic Segmentation, Action Triplet Recognition, and Surgical Phase Recognition. Results: Our findings demonstrate that integrating adaptive FedSAM into the federated MAE approach improves pretraining, leading to a reduction in reconstruction loss per patch. The application of FL-EndoViT in surgical downstream tasks results in performance comparable to CEN-EndoViT. Furthermore, FL-EndoViT exhibits advantages over CEN-EndoViT in surgical scene segmentation when data is limited and in action triplet recognition when large datasets are used. Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential of federated learning for privacy-preserving training of surgical foundation models, offering a robust and generalizable solution for surgical data science. Effective collaboration requires adapting federated learning methods, such as the integration of FedSAM, which can accommodate the inherent data heterogeneity across institutions. In future, exploring FL in video-based models may enhance these capabilities by incorporating spatiotemporal dynamics crucial for real-world surgical environments.

- **[Gaussian Splatting is an Effective Data Generator for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16740)**  `arXiv:2504.16740`  `cs.CV`

  We investigate data augmentation for 3D object detection in autonomous driving. We utilize recent advancements in 3D reconstruction based on Gaussian Splatting for 3D object placement in driving scenes. Unlike existing diffusion-based methods that synthesize images conditioned on BEV layouts, our approach places 3D objects directly in the reconstructed 3D space with explicitly imposed geometric transformations. This ensures both the physical plausibility of object placement and highly accurate 3D pose and position annotations.Our experiments demonstrate that even by integrating a limited number of external 3D objects into real scenes, the augmented data significantly enhances 3D object detection performance and outperforms existing diffusion-based 3D augmentation for object detection. Extensive testing on the nuScenes dataset reveals that imposing high geometric diversity in object placement has a greater impact compared to the appearance diversity of objects. Additionally, we show that generating hard examples, either by maximizing detection loss or imposing high visual occlusion in camera images, does not lead to more efficient 3D data augmentation for camera-based 3D object detection in autonomous driving.

- **[Dual-Camera All-in-Focus Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16636)**  `arXiv:2504.16636`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xianrui Luo, Zijin Wu, Juewen Peng, Huiqiang Sun, Zhiguo Cao, Guosheng Lin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present the first framework capable of synthesizing the all-in-focus neural radiance field (NeRF) from inputs without manual refocusing. Without refocusing, the camera will automatically focus on the fixed object for all views, and current NeRF methods typically using one camera fail due to the consistent defocus blur and a lack of sharp reference. To restore the all-in-focus NeRF, we introduce the dual-camera from smartphones, where the ultra-wide camera has a wider depth-of-field (DoF) and the main camera possesses a higher resolution. The dual camera pair saves the high-fidelity details from the main camera and uses the ultra-wide camera's deep DoF as reference for all-in-focus restoration. To this end, we first implement spatial warping and color matching to align the dual camera, followed by a defocus-aware fusion module with learnable defocus parameters to predict a defocus map and fuse the aligned camera pair. We also build a multi-view dataset that includes image pairs of the main and ultra-wide cameras in a smartphone. Extensive experiments on this dataset verify that our solution, termed DC-NeRF, can produce high-quality all-in-focus novel views and compares favorably against strong baselines quantitatively and qualitatively. We further show DoF applications of DC-NeRF with adjustable blur intensity and focal plane, including refocusing and split diopter.

- **[ToF-Splatting: Dense SLAM using Sparse Time-of-Flight Depth and Multi-Frame Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16545)**  `arXiv:2504.16545`  `cs.CV`  
  _Andrea Conti, Matteo Poggi, Valerio Cambareri, Martin R. Oswald, Stefano Mattoccia_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors provide efficient active depth sensing at relatively low power budgets; among such designs, only very sparse measurements from low-resolution sensors are considered to meet the increasingly limited power constraints of mobile and AR/VR devices. However, such extreme sparsity levels limit the seamless usage of ToF depth in SLAM. In this work, we propose ToF-Splatting, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM pipeline tailored for using effectively very sparse ToF input data. Our approach improves upon the state of the art by introducing a multi-frame integration module, which produces dense depth maps by merging cues from extremely sparse ToF depth, monocular color, and multi-view geometry. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real sparse ToF datasets demonstrate the viability of our approach, as it achieves state-of-the-art tracking and mapping performances on reference datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We tackle the problem of automatic calibration of radially distorted cameras in challenging conditions. Accurately determining distortion parameters typically requires either 1) solving the full Structure from Motion (SfM) problem involving camera poses, 3D points, and the distortion parameters, which is only possible if many images with sufficient overlap are provided, or 2) relying heavily on learning-based methods that are comparatively less accurate. In this work, we demonstrate that distortion calibration can be decoupled from 3D reconstruction, maintaining the accuracy of SfM-based methods while avoiding many of the associated complexities. This is achieved by working in Projective Space, where the geometry is unique up to a homography, which encapsulates all camera parameters except for distortion. Our proposed method, Projective Radial Distortion Averaging, averages multiple distortion estimates in a fully projective framework without creating 3d points and full bundle adjustment. By relying on pairwise projective relations, our methods support any feature-matching approaches without constructing point tracks across multiple images.

- **[Cross Paradigm Representation and Alignment Transformer for Image Deraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16455)**  `arXiv:2504.16455`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shun Zou, Yi Zou, Juncheng Li, Guangwei Gao, Guojun Qi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based networks have achieved strong performance in low-level vision tasks like image deraining by utilizing spatial or channel-wise self-attention. However, irregular rain patterns and complex geometric overlaps challenge single-paradigm architectures, necessitating a unified framework to integrate complementary global-local and spatial-channel representations. To address this, we propose a novel Cross Paradigm Representation and Alignment Transformer (CPRAformer). Its core idea is the hierarchical representation and alignment, leveraging the strengths of both paradigms (spatial-channel and global-local) to aid image reconstruction. It bridges the gap within and between paradigms, aligning and coordinating them to enable deep interaction and fusion of features. Specifically, we use two types of self-attention in the Transformer blocks: sparse prompt channel self-attention (SPC-SA) and spatial pixel refinement self-attention (SPR-SA). SPC-SA enhances global channel dependencies through dynamic sparsity, while SPR-SA focuses on spatial rain distribution and fine-grained texture recovery. To address the feature misalignment and knowledge differences between them, we introduce the Adaptive Alignment Frequency Module (AAFM), which aligns and interacts with features in a two-stage progressive manner, enabling adaptive guidance and complementarity. This reduces the information gap within and between paradigms. Through this unified cross-paradigm dynamic interaction framework, we achieve the extraction of the most valuable interactive fusion information from the two paradigms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight benchmark datasets and further validates CPRAformer's robustness in other image restoration tasks and downstream applications.

- **[SaENeRF: Suppressing Artifacts in Event-based Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16389)**  `arXiv:2504.16389`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yuanjian Wang, Yufei Deng, Rong Xiao, Jiahao Fan, Chenwei Tang, Deng Xiong, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Event cameras are neuromorphic vision sensors that asynchronously capture changes in logarithmic brightness changes, offering significant advantages such as low latency, low power consumption, low bandwidth, and high dynamic range. While these characteristics make them ideal for high-speed scenarios, reconstructing geometrically consistent and photometrically accurate 3D representations from event data remains fundamentally challenging. Current event-based Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods partially address these challenges but suffer from persistent artifacts caused by aggressive network learning in early stages and the inherent noise of event cameras. To overcome these limitations, we present SaENeRF, a novel self-supervised framework that effectively suppresses artifacts and enables 3D-consistent, dense, and photorealistic NeRF reconstruction of static scenes solely from event streams. Our approach normalizes predicted radiance variations based on accumulated event polarities, facilitating progressive and rapid learning for scene representation construction. Additionally, we introduce regularization losses specifically designed to suppress artifacts in regions where photometric changes fall below the event threshold and simultaneously enhance the light intensity difference of non-zero events, thereby improving the visual fidelity of the reconstructed scene. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces artifacts and achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to existing methods.

- **[Luminance-GS: Adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting to Challenging Lighting Conditions with View-Adaptive Curve Adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01503)**  `arXiv:2504.01503`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ziteng Cui, Xuangeng Chu, Tatsuya Harada_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Capturing high-quality photographs under diverse real-world lighting conditions is challenging, as both natural lighting (e.g., low-light) and camera exposure settings (e.g., exposure time) significantly impact image quality. This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-view scenarios, where variations in lighting and image signal processor (ISP) settings across viewpoints introduce photometric inconsistencies. Such lighting degradations and view-dependent variations pose substantial challenges to novel view synthesis (NVS) frameworks based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). To address this, we introduce Luminance-GS, a novel approach to achieving high-quality novel view synthesis results under diverse challenging lighting conditions using 3DGS. By adopting per-view color matrix mapping and view-adaptive curve adjustments, Luminance-GS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across various lighting conditions -- including low-light, overexposure, and varying exposure -- while not altering the original 3DGS explicit representation. Compared to previous NeRF- and 3DGS-based baselines, Luminance-GS provides real-time rendering speed with improved reconstruction quality.

- **[Dynamic EventNeRF: Reconstructing General Dynamic Scenes from Multi-view RGB and Event Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06770)**  `arXiv:2412.06770`  `cs.CV`  
  _Viktor Rudnev, Gereon Fox, Mohamed Elgharib, Christian Theobalt, Vladislav Golyanik_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Volumetric reconstruction of dynamic scenes is an important problem in computer vision. It is especially challenging in poor lighting and with fast motion. This is partly due to limitations of RGB cameras: To capture frames under low lighting, the exposure time needs to be increased, which leads to more motion blur. In contrast, event cameras, which record changes in pixel brightness asynchronously, are much less dependent on lighting, making them more suitable for recording fast motion. We hence propose the first method to spatiotemporally reconstruct a scene from sparse multi-view event streams and sparse RGB frames. We train a sequence of cross-faded time-conditioned NeRF models, one per short recording segment. The individual segments are supervised with a set of event- and RGB-based losses and sparse-view regularisation. We assemble a real-world multi-view camera rig with six static event cameras around the object and record a benchmark multi-view event stream dataset of challenging motions. Our work outperforms RGB-based baselines, producing state-of-the-art results, and opens up the topic of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a new path for fast scene capture beyond RGB cameras. The code and the data will be released soon atthis https URL
