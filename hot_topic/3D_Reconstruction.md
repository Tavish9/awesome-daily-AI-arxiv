- **[Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Models-based Anomaly Detection for under-constrained Cable-Driven Parallel Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07714)**  `arXiv:2507.07714`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are increasingly used for load manipulation tasks involving predefined toolpaths with intermediate stops. At each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive, unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions. Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4% average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.

- **[Distributed Surface Inspection via Operational Modal Analysis by a Swarm of Miniaturized Vibration-Sensing Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07724)**  `arXiv:2507.07724`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robot swarms offer the potential to serve a variety of distributed sensing applications. An interesting real-world application that stands to benefit significantly from deployment of swarms is structural monitoring, where traditional sensor networks face challenges in structural coverage due to their static nature. This paper investigates the deployment of a swarm of miniaturized vibration sensing robots to inspect and localize structural damages on a surface section within a high-fidelity simulation environment. In particular, we consider a 1 m x 1 m x 3 mm steel surface section and utilize finite element analysis using Abaqus to obtain realistic structural vibration data. The resulting vibration data is imported into the physics-based robotic simulator Webots, where we simulate the dynamics of our surface inspecting robot swarm. We employ (i) Gaussian process estimators to guide the robots' exploration as they collect vibration samples across the surface and (ii) operational modal analysis to detect structural damages by estimating and comparing existing and intact structural vibration patterns. We analyze the influence of exploration radii on estimation uncertainty and assess the effectiveness of our method across 10 randomized scenarios, where the number, locations, surface area, and depth of structural damages vary. Our simulation studies validate the efficacy of our miniaturized robot swarm for vibration-based structural inspection.

- **[EXPO: Stable Reinforcement Learning with Expressive Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07986)**  `arXiv:2507.07986`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Perry Dong, Qiyang Li, Dorsa Sadigh, Chelsea Finn_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution. The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

- **[Low Resource Reconstruction Attacks Through Benign Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07947)**  `arXiv:2507.07947`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Sol Yarkoni, Roi Livni_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and designed prompts.In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly, benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

- **[OPC: One-Point-Contraction Unlearning Toward Deep Feature Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07754)**  `arXiv:2507.07754`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Jaeheun Jung, Bosung Jung, Suhyun Bae, Donghun Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of ``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm: One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning methods.

- **[Some Theoretical Results on Layerwise Effective Dimension Oscillations in Finite Width ReLU Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07675)**  `arXiv:2507.07675`  `cs.LG`  
  _Darshan Makwana_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx 0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the "revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In particular, these peaks occur at depths $\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m \approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

- **[Estimating Dataset Dimension via Singular Metrics under the Manifold Hypothesis: Application to Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07291)**  `arXiv:2507.07291`  `cs.LG`  
  _Paola Causin, Alessio Marta_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures, as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality, showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for monitoring model capacity.

- **[User-Based Sequential Modeling with Transformer Encoders for Insider Threat Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23446)**  `arXiv:2506.23446`  `cs.LG`  
  _Mohamed Elbasheer, Adewale Akinfaderin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Insider threat detection presents unique challenges due to the authorized status of malicious actors and the subtlety of anomalous behaviors. Existing machine learning methods often treat user activity as isolated events, thereby failing to leverage sequential dependencies in user behavior. In this study, we propose a User-Based Sequencing (UBS) methodology, transforming the CERT insider threat dataset into structured temporal sequences suitable for deep sequential modeling. We deploy a Transformer Encoder architecture to model benign user activity and employ its reconstruction errors as anomaly scores. These scores are subsequently evaluated using three unsupervised outlier detection algorithms: One-Class SVM (OCSVM), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and Isolation Forest (iForest). Across four rigorously designed test sets, including combinations of multiple CERT dataset releases, our UBS-Transformer pipeline consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance - notably 96.61% accuracy, 99.43% recall, 96.38% F1-score, 95.00% AUROC, and exceptionally low false negative (0.0057) and false positive (0.0571) rates. Comparative analyses demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms tabular and conventional autoencoder baselines, underscoring the efficacy of sequential user modeling and advanced anomaly detection in the insider threat domain.

- **[Single-pass Adaptive Image Tokenization for Minimum Program Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07995)**  `arXiv:2507.07995`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality. KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more. Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs. out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

- **[Masked Image Modeling: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06687)**  `arXiv:2408.06687`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we survey recent studies on masked image modeling (MIM), an approach that emerged as a powerful self-supervised learning technique in computer vision. The MIM task involves masking some information, e.g. pixels, patches, or even latent representations, and training a model, usually an autoencoder, to predicting the missing information by using the context available in the visible part of the input. We identify and formalize two categories of approaches on how to implement MIM as a pretext task, one based on reconstruction and one based on contrastive learning. Then, we construct a taxonomy and review the most prominent papers in recent years. We complement the manually constructed taxonomy with a dendrogram obtained by applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm. We further identify relevant clusters via manually inspecting the resulting dendrogram. Our review also includes datasets that are commonly used in MIM research. We aggregate the performance results of various masked image modeling methods on the most popular datasets, to facilitate the comparison of competing methods. Finally, we identify research gaps and propose several interesting directions of future work. We supplement our survey with the following public repository containing organized references:this https URL.

- **[Benchmarking Content-Based Puzzle Solvers on Corrupted Jigsaw Puzzles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07828)**  `arXiv:2507.07828`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Richard Dirauf, Florian Wolz, Dario Zanca, Bj√∂rn Eskofier_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

  _Tianwei Mu, Feiyu Duan, Bo Zhou, Dan Xue, Manhong Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a novel few-shot cross-domain anomaly detection framework, Nexus Vision Transformer for Anomaly Detection (NexViTAD), based on vision foundation models, which effectively addresses domain-shift challenges in industrial anomaly detection through innovative shared subspace projection mechanisms and multi-task learning (MTL) module. The main innovations include: (1) a hierarchical adapter module that adaptively fuses complementary features from Hiera and DINO-v2 pre-trained models, constructing more robust feature representations; (2) a shared subspace projection strategy that enables effective cross-domain knowledge transfer through bottleneck dimension constraints and skip connection mechanisms; (3) a MTL Decoder architecture supports simultaneous processing of multiple source domains, significantly enhancing model generalization capabilities; (4) an anomaly score inference method based on Sinkhorn-K-means clustering, combined with Gaussian filtering and adaptive threshold processing for precise pixel level. Valuated on the MVTec AD dataset, NexViTAD delivers state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of 97.5%, AP of 70.4%, and PRO of 95.2% in the target domains, surpassing other recent models, marking a transformative advance in cross-domain defect detection.

- **[Objectomaly: Objectness-Aware Refinement for OoD Segmentation with Structural Consistency and Boundary Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07460)**  `arXiv:2507.07460`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Jeonghoon Song, Sunghun Kim, Jaegyun Im, Byeongjoon Noh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose \textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1) Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2) Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to 0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon publication.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs. Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly, with rFID $\textbf{0.49}$ v.s. $\textbf{0.91}$, and achieve superior PSNR on all zero-shot benchmarks. These results highlight the superiority of \NickName~in reconstruction and pave the way for preserving fidelity in HD image processing tasks. Code will be publicly available atthis https URL.

  Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data, synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally, camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

- **[Motion-Aware Adaptive Pixel Pruning for Efficient Local Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07708)**  `arXiv:2507.07708`  `cs.CV`  
  _Wei Shang, Dongwei Ren, Wanying Zhang, Pengfei Zhu, Qinghua Hu, Wangmeng Zuo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$ convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT).

- **[Compressive Imaging Reconstruction via Tensor Decomposed Multi-Resolution Grid Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07707)**  `arXiv:2507.07707`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhenyu Jin, Yisi Luo, Xile Zhao, Deyu Meng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI reconstruction method.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields, often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs. Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

  The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD dataset is available atthis https URL.

- **[EscherNet++: Simultaneous Amodal Completion and Scalable View Synthesis through Masked Fine-Tuning and Enhanced Feed-Forward 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07410)**  `arXiv:2507.07410`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings, while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

- **[CL-Polyp: A Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Network for Accurate Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07154)**  `arXiv:2507.07154`  `cs.CV`  
  _Desheng Li, Chaoliang Liu, Zhiyong Xiao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However, these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules: the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA) module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation tasks.

  Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

  Combining reconstruction models with generative models has emerged as a promising paradigm for closed-loop simulation in autonomous driving. For example, ReconDreamer has demonstrated remarkable success in rendering large-scale maneuvers. However, a significant gap remains between the generated data and real-world sensor observations, particularly in terms of fidelity for structured elements, such as the ground surface. To address these challenges, we propose ReconDreamer++, an enhanced framework that significantly improves the overall rendering quality by mitigating the domain gap and refining the representation of the ground surface. Specifically, ReconDreamer++ introduces the Novel Trajectory Deformable Network (NTDNet), which leverages learnable spatial deformation mechanisms to bridge the domain gap between synthesized novel views and original sensor observations. Moreover, for structured elements such as the ground surface, we preserve geometric prior knowledge in 3D Gaussians, and the optimization process focuses on refining appearance attributes while preserving the underlying geometric structure. Experimental evaluations conducted on multiple datasets (Waymo, nuScenes, PandaSet, and EUVS) confirm the superior performance of ReconDreamer++. Specifically, on Waymo, ReconDreamer++ achieves performance comparable to Street Gaussians for the original trajectory while significantly outperforming ReconDreamer on novel trajectories. In particular, it achieves substantial improvements, including a 6.1% increase in NTA-IoU, a 23. 0% improvement in FID, and a remarkable 4.5% gain in the ground surface metric NTL-IoU, highlighting its effectiveness in accurately reconstructing structured elements such as the road surface.

  We study reconstructing and predicting 3D fluid appearance and velocity from a single video. Current methods require multi-view videos for fluid reconstruction. We present FluidNexus, a novel framework that bridges video generation and physics simulation to tackle this task. Our key insight is to synthesize multiple novel-view videos as references for reconstruction. FluidNexus consists of two key components: (1) a novel-view video synthesizer that combines frame-wise view synthesis with video diffusion refinement for generating realistic videos, and (2) a physics-integrated particle representation coupling differentiable simulation and rendering to simultaneously facilitate 3D fluid reconstruction and prediction. To evaluate our approach, we collect two new real-world fluid datasets featuring textured backgrounds and object interactions. Our method enables dynamic novel view synthesis, future prediction, and interaction simulation from a single fluid video. Project website:this https URL.
