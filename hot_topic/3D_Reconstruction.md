- **[MGPRL: Distributed Multi-Gaussian Processes for Wi-Fi-based Multi-Robot Relative Localization in Large Indoor Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23514)**  `arXiv:2506.23514`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.MA`

  Relative localization is a crucial capability for multi-robot systems operating in GPS-denied environments. Existing approaches for multi-robot relative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like cameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high computational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint environments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel distributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull of multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ co-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware multi-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based alignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI field of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are utilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative localization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations with that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with limited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi RSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or offline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed MGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments, comparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase that MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we open source MGPRL as a ROS packagethis https URL.

  3D world models (i.e., learning-based 3D dynamics models) offer a promising approach to generalizable robotic manipulation by capturing the underlying physics of environment evolution conditioned on robot actions. However, existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss, supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material, multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials, trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream visuomotor tasks.

  Autonomous visual navigation is an essential element in robot autonomy. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising policy training paradigm. However existing RL methods suffer from high sample complexity, poor sim-to-real transfer, and limited runtime adaptability to navigation scenarios not seen during training. These problems are particularly challenging for drones, with complex nonlinear and unstable dynamics, and strong dynamic coupling between control and perception. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with differentiable deep reinforcement learning (DDRL) to train vision-based drone navigation policies. By leveraging high-fidelity 3D scene representations and differentiable simulation, our method improves sample efficiency and sim-to-real transfer. Additionally, we incorporate a Context-aided Estimator Network (CENet) to adapt to environmental variations at runtime. Moreover, by curriculum training in a mixture of different surrounding environments, we achieve in-task generalization, the ability to solve new instances of a task not seen during training. Drone hardware experiments demonstrate our method's high training efficiency compared to state-of-the-art RL methods, zero shot sim-to-real transfer for real robot deployment without fine tuning, and ability to adapt to new instances within the same task class (e.g. to fly through a gate at different locations with different distractors in the environment). Our simulator and training framework are open-sourced at:this https URL.

  The recently proposed xLSTM is a powerful model that leverages expressive multiplicative gating and residual connections, providing the temporal capacity needed for long-horizon forecasting and representation learning. This architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach, the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions: Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17 real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR. In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23 popular anomaly detection baselines. Our paper is the first work revealing the powerful modeling capabilities of xLSTM for anomaly detection, paving the way for exciting new developments on this subject.

- **[Enhancing Insider Threat Detection Using User-Based Sequencing and Transformer Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23446)**  `arXiv:2506.23446`  `cs.LG`  
  _Mohamed Elbasheer, Adewale Akinfaderin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Insider threat detection presents unique challenges due to the authorized status of malicious actors and the subtlety of anomalous behaviors. Existing machine learning methods often treat user activity as isolated events, thereby failing to leverage sequential dependencies in user behavior. In this study, we propose a User-Based Sequencing (UBS) methodology, transforming the CERT insider threat dataset into structured temporal sequences suitable for deep sequential modeling. We deploy a Transformer Encoder architecture to model benign user activity and employ its reconstruction errors as anomaly scores. These scores are subsequently evaluated using three unsupervised outlier detection algorithms: One-Class SVM (OCSVM), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and Isolation Forest (iForest). Across four rigorously designed test sets, including combinations of multiple CERT dataset releases, our UBS-Transformer pipeline consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance - notably 96.61% accuracy, 99.43% recall, 96.38% F1-score, 95.00% AUROC, and exceptionally low false negative (0.0057) and false positive (0.0571) rates. Comparative analyses demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms tabular and conventional autoencoder baselines, underscoring the efficacy of sequential user modeling and advanced anomaly detection in the insider threat domain.

- **[Sub-MoE: Efficient Mixture-of-Expert LLMs Compression via Subspace Expert Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23266)**  `arXiv:2506.23266`  `cs.LG`  
  _Lujun Li, Zhu Qiyuan, Jiacheng Wang, Wei Li, Hao Gu, Sirui Han, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs face significant obstacles due to their massive parameter scale, which imposes memory, storage, and deployment challenges. Although recent expert merging methods promise greater efficiency by consolidating multiple experts, they are fundamentally hindered by parameter conflicts arising from expert specialization. In this paper, we present Sub-MoE, a novel MoE compression framework via Subspace Expert Merging. Our key insight is to perform joint Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on concatenated expert weights, reducing conflicting parameters by extracting shared $U$-matrices while enabling effective merging of the expert-specific $V$ components. Specifically, Sub-MoE consists of two innovative phases: (1) Adaptive Expert Clustering, which groups functionally coherent experts via K-means clustering based on cosine similarity of expert outputs; and (2) Subspace Expert Merging, which first enforces Experts Union Decomposition to derive the shared $U$-matrix across experts in the same group, then pursues frequency-based merging for individual $V$-matrices, and finalizes expert reconstruction using the merged $V$-matrix. In this way, we align and fuse experts in a shared subspace, and can be extended with intra-expert compression for further inference optimization. Extensive experiments on Mixtral, DeepSeek, and Qwen-1.5|3 MoE LLMs demonstrate that our Sub-MoE significantly outperforms existing expert pruning and merging methods. Notably, our Sub-MoE maintains 96\%|86\% of original performance with 25\%|50\% expert reduction on Mixtral-8x7B in zero-shot benchmarks. Code will be released atthis https URL.

- **[Aircraft Trajectory Dataset Augmentation in Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07585)**  `arXiv:2506.07585`  `cs.LG`  
  _Seokbin Yoon, Keumjin Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aircraft trajectory modeling plays a crucial role in Air Traffic Management (ATM) and is important for various downstream tasks, including conflict detection and landing time prediction. Dataset augmentation through the addition of synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is sufficient and balanced. In this work, we propose a novel framework called ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework, a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned latent space. The converted dataset in the latent space is projected into reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original dimension, and they are decoded with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Several experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new, high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the results of several baselines.

- **[Towards foundational LiDAR world models with efficient latent flow matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23434)**  `arXiv:2506.23434`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Tianran Liu, Shengwen Zhao, Nicholas Rhinehart_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LiDAR-based world models offer more structured and geometry-aware representations than their image-based counterparts. However, existing LiDAR world models are narrowly trained; each model excels only in the domain for which it was built. Can we develop LiDAR world models that exhibit strong transferability across multiple domains? We conduct the first systematic domain transfer study across three demanding scenarios: (i) outdoor to indoor generalization, (ii) sparse-beam \& dense-beam adaptation, and (iii) non-semantic to semantic transfer. Given different amounts of fine-tuning data, our experiments show that a single pre-trained model can achieve up to 11% absolute improvement (83\% relative) over training from scratch and outperforms training from scratch in 30/36 of our comparisons. This transferability of dynamic learning significantly reduces the reliance on manually annotated data for semantic occupancy forecasting: our method exceed the previous semantic occupancy forecasting models with only 5% of the labeled training data required by prior models. We also observed inefficiencies of current LiDAR world models, mainly through their under-compression of LiDAR data and inefficient training objectives. To address this, we propose a latent conditional flow matching (CFM)-based frameworks that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy using only half the training data and a compression ratio 6 times higher than that of prior methods. Our model achieves SOTA performance on future-trajectory-conditioned semantic occupancy forecasting while being 23x more computationally efficient (a 28x FPS speedup); and achieves SOTA performance on semantic occupancy forecasting while being 2x more computationally efficient (a 1.1x FPS speedup).

- **[RoboPearls: Editable Video Simulation for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22756)**  `arXiv:2506.22756`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The development of generalist robot manipulation policies has seen significant progress, driven by large-scale demonstration data across diverse environments. However, the high cost and inefficiency of collecting real-world demonstrations hinder the scalability of data acquisition. While existing simulation platforms enable controlled environments for robotic learning, the challenge of bridging the sim-to-real gap remains. To address these challenges, we propose RoboPearls, an editable video simulation framework for robotic manipulation. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the construction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration videos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various object manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic Distillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM). Moreover, by incorporating large language models (LLMs), RoboPearls automates the simulation production process in a user-friendly manner through flexible command interpretation and execution. Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language model (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for performance enhancement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboPearls, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenes, including RLBench, COLOSSEUM, Ego4D, Open X-Embodiment, and a real-world robot, which demonstrate our satisfactory simulation performance.

- **[Mesh-Learner: Texturing Mesh with Spherical Harmonics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19938)**  `arXiv:2504.19938`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Yunfei Wan, Jianheng Liu, Chunran Zheng, Jiarong Lin, Fu Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present a 3D reconstruction and rendering framework termed Mesh-Learner that is natively compatible with traditional rasterization pipelines. It integrates mesh and spherical harmonic (SH) texture (i.e., texture filled with SH coefficients) into the learning process to learn each mesh s view-dependent radiance end-to-end. Images are rendered by interpolating surrounding SH Texels at each pixel s sampling point using a novel interpolation method. Conversely, gradients from each pixel are back-propagated to the related SH Texels in SH textures. Mesh-Learner exploits graphic features of rasterization pipeline (texture sampling, deferred rendering) to render, which makes Mesh-Learner naturally compatible with tools (e.g., Blender) and tasks (e.g., 3D reconstruction, scene rendering, reinforcement learning for robotics) that are based on rasterization pipelines. Our system can train vast, unlimited scenes because we transfer only the SH textures within the frustum to the GPU for training. At other times, the SH textures are stored in CPU RAM, which results in moderate GPU memory usage. The rendering results on interpolation and extrapolation sequences in the Replica and FAST-LIVO2 datasets achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting and M2-Mapping). To benefit the society, the code will be available atthis https URL.

- **[MotionGPT3: Human Motion as a Second Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24086)**  `arXiv:2506.24086`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Though recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated strong capabilities and opportunities in unified understanding and generation, the development of unified motion-language models remains underexplored. To enable such models with high-fidelity human motion, two core challenges must be addressed. The first is the reconstruction gap between the continuous motion modality and discrete representation in an autoregressive manner, and the second is the degradation of language intelligence during unified training. Inspired by the mixture of experts, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal motion-language model that treats human motion as a second modality, decoupling motion modeling via separate model parameters and enabling both effective cross-modal interaction and efficient multimodal scaling training. To preserve language intelligence, the text branch retains the original structure and parameters of the pretrained language model, while a new motion branch is integrated via a shared attention mechanism, enabling bidirectional information flow between two modalities. We first employ a motion Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode raw human motion into latent representations. Based on this continuous latent space, the motion branch predicts motion latents directly from intermediate hidden states using a diffusion head, bypassing discrete tokenization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves competitive performance on both motion understanding and generation tasks while preserving strong language capabilities, establishing a unified bimodal motion diffusion framework within an autoregressive manner.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) offer exceptional fidelity for video compression by learning per-video optimized functions, but their adoption is crippled by impractically slow encoding times. Existing attempts to accelerate INR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level control essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD (Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that fundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first rapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to efficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then frozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders for individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space sampling. This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding speed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality and compression ratios. Critically, SIEDD retains full coordinate-based control, enabling continuous resolution decoding and eliminating costly transcoding. Our approach significantly advances the practicality of high-fidelity neural video compression, demonstrating a scalable and efficient path towards real-world deployment.

- **[Token Activation Map to Visually Explain Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23270)**  `arXiv:2506.23270`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are broadly empowering various fields. Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively, where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods, showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color, shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc).

- **[Enhancing Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Inverse Problems by Integrating Crafted Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09850)**  `arXiv:2411.09850`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful foundation model for visual generations. With an appropriate sampling process, it can effectively serve as a generative prior for solving general inverse problems. Current posterior sampling-based methods take the measurement (i.e., degraded image sample) into the posterior sampling to infer the distribution of the target data (i.e., clean image sample). However, in this manner, we show that high-frequency information can be prematurely introduced during the early stages, which could induce larger posterior estimate errors during restoration sampling. To address this observation, we first reveal that forming the log-posterior gradient with the noisy measurement ( i.e., noisy measurement from a diffusion forward process) instead of the clean one can benefit the early posterior sampling. Consequently, we propose a novel diffusion posterior sampling method DPS-CM, which incorporates a Crafted Measurement (i.e., noisy measurement crafted by a reverse denoising process, rather than constructed from the diffusion forward process) to form the posterior estimate. This integration aims to mitigate the misalignment with the diffusion prior caused by cumulative posterior estimate errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the overall capacity to solve general and noisy inverse problems, such as Gaussian deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, nonlinear deblurring, and tasks with Poisson noise, relative to existing approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs), have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with both model size and training data on MMEB.

  Decoding visual stimuli from neural activity is essential for understanding the human brain. While fMRI methods have successfully reconstructed static images, fMRI-to-video reconstruction faces challenges due to the need for capturing spatiotemporal dynamics like motion and scene transitions. Recent approaches have improved semantic and perceptual alignment but struggle to integrate coarse fMRI data with detailed visual features. Inspired by the hierarchical organization of the visual system, we propose NEURONS, a novel framework that decouples learning into four correlated sub-tasks: key object segmentation, concept recognition, scene description, and blurry video reconstruction. This approach simulates the visual cortex's functional specialization, allowing the model to capture diverse video content. In the inference stage, NEURONS generates robust conditioning signals for a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion model to reconstruct the videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NEURONS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving solid improvements in video consistency (26.6%) and semantic-level accuracy (19.1%). Notably, NEURONS shows a strong functional correlation with the visual cortex, highlighting its potential for brain-computer interfaces and clinical applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction of high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes remains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds, with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior, our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics simulations or animation.

  Multi-view 3D reconstruction remains a core challenge in computer vision. Recent methods, such as DUST3R and its successors, directly regress pointmaps from image pairs without relying on known scene geometry or camera parameters. However, the performance of these models is constrained by the diversity and scale of available training data. In this work, we introduce Puzzles, a data augmentation strategy that synthesizes an unbounded volume of high-quality posed video-depth data from a single image or video clip. By simulating diverse camera trajectories and realistic scene geometry through targeted image transformations, Puzzles significantly enhances data variety. Extensive experiments show that integrating Puzzles into existing video-based 3D reconstruction pipelines consistently boosts performance without modifying the underlying network architecture. Notably, models trained on only ten percent of the original data augmented with Puzzles still achieve accuracy comparable to those trained on the full dataset. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Viewpoint missing of objects is common in scene reconstruction, as camera paths typically prioritize capturing the overall scene structure rather than individual objects. This makes it highly challenging to achieve high-fidelity object-level modeling while maintaining accurate scene-level representation. Addressing this issue is critical for advancing downstream tasks requiring detailed object understanding and appearance modeling. In this paper, we introduce Refine Any object In any ScenE (RAISE), a novel 3D enhancement framework that leverages 3D generative priors to recover fine-grained object geometry and appearance under missing views. Starting from substituting degraded objects with proxies, via a 3D generative model with strong 3D understanding, RAISE progressively refines geometry and texture by aligning each proxy to its degraded counterpart in 7-DOF pose, followed by correcting spatial and appearance inconsistencies via registration-constrained enhancement. This two-stage refinement ensures the high-fidelity geometry and appearance of the original object in unseen views while maintaining consistency in spatial positioning, observed geometry, and appearance. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show that RAISE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view synthesis and geometry completion tasks.

- **[Towards Initialization-free Calibrated Bundle Adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23808)**  `arXiv:2506.23808`  `cs.CV`  
  _Carl Olsson, Amanda Nilsson_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A recent series of works has shown that initialization-free BA can be achieved using pseudo Object Space Error (pOSE) as a surrogate objective. The initial reconstruction-step optimizes an objective where all terms are projectively invariant and it cannot incorporate knowledge of the camera calibration. As a result, the solution is only determined up to a projective transformation of the scene and the process requires more data for successful reconstruction.In contrast, we present a method that is able to use the known camera calibration thereby producing near metric solutions, that is, reconstructions that are accurate up to a similarity transformation. To achieve this we introduce pairwise relative rotation estimates that carry information about camera calibration. These are only invariant to similarity transformations, thus encouraging solutions that preserve metric features of the real scene. Our method can be seen as integrating rotation averaging into the pOSE framework striving towards initialization-free calibrated SfM.Our experimental evaluation shows that we are able to reliably optimize our objective, achieving convergence to the global minimum with high probability from random starting solutions, resulting in accurate near metric reconstructions.

  Video identity customization seeks to synthesize realistic, temporally coherent videos of a specific subject, given a single reference image and a text prompt. This task presents two core challenges: (1) maintaining identity consistency while aligning with the described appearance and actions, and (2) generating natural, fluid motion without unrealistic stiffness. To address these challenges, we introduce Proteus-ID, a novel diffusion-based framework for identity-consistent and motion-coherent video customization. First, we propose a Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF) module that unifies visual and textual cues into a joint identity representation using a Q-Former, providing coherent guidance to the diffusion model and eliminating modality imbalance. Second, we present a Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII) mechanism that dynamically modulates identity conditioning across denoising steps, improving fine-detail reconstruction. Third, we propose Adaptive Motion Learning (AML), a self-supervised strategy that reweights the training loss based on optical-flow-derived motion heatmaps, enhancing motion realism without requiring additional inputs. To support this task, we construct Proteus-Bench, a high-quality dataset comprising 200K curated clips for training and 150 individuals from diverse professions and ethnicities for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Proteus-ID outperforms prior methods in identity preservation, text alignment, and motion quality, establishing a new benchmark for video identity customization.

  We propose Subjective Camera, a human-as-imaging-device paradigm that reconstructs real-world scenes from mental impressions through synergistic use of verbal descriptions and progressive rough sketches. This approach overcomes dual limitations of language ambiguity and sketch abstraction by treating the user's drawing sequence as priors, effectively translating subjective perceptual expectations into photorealistic images.Existing approaches face three fundamental barriers: (1) user-specific subjective input biases, (2) huge modality gap between planar sketch and 3D priors in diffusion, and (3) sketch quality-sensitive performance degradation. Current solutions either demand resource-intensive model adaptation or impose impractical requirements on sketch precision.Our framework addresses these challenges through concept-sequential generation. (1) We establish robust appearance priors through text-reward optimization, and then implement sequence-aware disentangled generation that processes concepts in sketching order; these steps accommodate user-specific subjective expectation in a train-free way. (2) We employ latent optimization that effectively bridges the modality gap between planar sketches and 3D priors in diffusion. (3) Our hierarchical reward-guided framework enables the use of rough sketches without demanding artistic expertise. Comprehensive evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in maintaining both semantic and spatial coherence.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), excelling in complex scene reconstruction and efficient rendering. However, it relies on high-quality point clouds from Structure-from-Motion (SfM), limiting its applicability. SfM also fails in texture-deficient or constrained-view scenarios, causing severe degradation in 3DGS reconstruction. To address this limitation, we propose AttentionGS, a novel framework that eliminates the dependency on high-quality initial point clouds by leveraging structural attention for direct 3D reconstruction from randomly initialization. In the early training stage, we introduce geometric attention to rapidly recover the global scene structure. As training progresses, we incorporate texture attention to refine fine-grained details and enhance rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ opacity-weighted gradients to guide Gaussian densification, leading to improved surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AttentionGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios where point cloud initialization is unreliable. Our approach paves the way for more robust and flexible 3D Gaussian Splatting in real-world applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In current practical face authentication systems, most face recognition (FR) algorithms are based on cosine similarity with softmax classification. Despite its reliable classification performance, this method struggles with hard samples. A popular strategy to improve FR performance is incorporating angular or cosine margins. However, it does not take face quality or recognition hardness into account, simply increasing the margin value and thus causing an overly uniform training strategy. To address this problem, a novel loss function is proposed, named Loss function for Hard High-quality Face (LH2Face). Firstly, a similarity measure based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is stated, specifically focusing on the logarithm of the Probability Density Function (PDF), which represents the distance between a probability distribution and a vector. Then, an adaptive margin-based multi-classification method using softmax, called the Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function, is implemented in the article. Furthermore, proxy-based loss functions are used to apply extra constraints between the proxy and sample to optimize their representation space distribution. Finally, a renderer is constructed that optimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa. Our LH2Face is superior to similiar schemes on hard high-quality face datasets, achieving 49.39% accuracy on the IJB-B dataset, which surpasses the second-place method by 2.37%.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chamfer Distance (CD) is a widely adopted metric in 3D point cloud learning due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, it suffers from a fundamental limitation: it relies solely on Euclidean distances, which often fail to capture the intrinsic geometry of 3D shapes. To address this limitation, we propose GeoCD, a topology-aware and fully differentiable approximation of geodesic distance designed to serve as a metric for 3D point cloud learning. Our experiments show that GeoCD consistently improves reconstruction quality over standard CD across various architectures and datasets. We demonstrate this by fine-tuning several models, initially trained with standard CD, using GeoCD. Remarkably, fine-tuning for a single epoch with GeoCD yields significant gains across multiple evaluation metrics.

  Accurate reconstruction of soft tissue is crucial for advancing automation in image-guided robotic surgery. The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic surgical scenes in real-time. However, 3D-GS-based methods still struggle in scenarios with varying illumination, such as low light and over-exposure. Training 3D-GS in such extreme light conditions leads to severe optimization problems and devastating rendering quality. To address these challenges, we present Endo-4DGX, a novel reconstruction method with illumination-adaptive Gaussian Splatting designed specifically for endoscopic scenes with uneven lighting. By incorporating illumination embeddings, our method effectively models view-dependent brightness variations. We introduce a region-aware enhancement module to model the sub-area lightness at the Gaussian level and a spatial-aware adjustment module to learn the view-consistent brightness adjustment. With the illumination adaptive design, Endo-4DGX achieves superior rendering performance under both low-light and over-exposure conditions while maintaining geometric accuracy. Additionally, we employ an exposure control loss to restore the appearance from adverse exposure to the normal level for illumination-adaptive optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that Endo-4DGX significantly outperforms combinations of state-of-the-art reconstruction and restoration methods in challenging lighting environments, underscoring its potential to advance robot-assisted surgical applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically, we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator. Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

  Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled RGB-only SLAM systems to achieve high-fidelity scene representation. However, the heavy reliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking undermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with severe viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we propose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel tri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality mapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable pairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust geometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric Constraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary geometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose estimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For mapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes geometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized Gaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust mechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on multiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior RGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems. Notably, in the most challenging dataset, our method improves tracking robustness, reducing the average Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 69.0\% while achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality. The implementation of our method will be released as open-source.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-dynamic scene reconstruction aims to represent static background with rigid spatial features and dynamic objects with deformed continuous spatiotemporal features. Typically, existing methods adopt unified representation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal features of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm fails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame imaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects. To address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various latent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between background and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate for frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting framework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we figure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in frame-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal features, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between background and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that Gaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal characteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal disentanglement of object Gaussians. Within Gaussian splatting framework, the cumulative scene-object disentanglement can improve the spatiotemporal discrimination between background and objects to render the time-continuous dynamic scene. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method.

  Novel view synthesis for dynamic $3$D scenes poses a significant challenge. Many notable efforts use NeRF-based approaches to address this task and yield impressive results. However, these methods rely heavily on sufficient motion parallax in the input images or videos. When the camera motion range becomes limited or even stationary (i.e., small camera motion), existing methods encounter two primary challenges: incorrect representation of scene geometry and inaccurate estimation of camera parameters. These challenges make prior methods struggle to produce satisfactory results or even become invalid. To address the first challenge, we propose a novel Distribution-based Depth Regularization (DDR) that ensures the rendering weight distribution to align with the true distribution. Specifically, unlike previous methods that use depth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the expectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample points from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce constraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object boundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the correct geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a visualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at the rendering weight level. For the second challenge, we incorporate camera parameter learning during training to enhance the robustness of our model to camera parameters. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in representing scenes with small camera motion input, and our results compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods.

  Single-image-to-3D models typically follow a sequential generation and reconstruction workflow. However, intermediate multi-view images synthesized by pre-trained generation models often lack cross-view consistency (CVC), significantly degrading 3D reconstruction performance. While recent methods attempt to refine CVC by feeding reconstruction results back into the multi-view generator, these approaches struggle with noisy and unstable reconstruction outputs that limit effective CVC improvement. We introduce AlignCVC, a novel framework that fundamentally re-frames single-image-to-3D generation through distribution alignment rather than relying on strict regression losses. Our key insight is to align both generated and reconstructed multi-view distributions toward the ground-truth multi-view distribution, establishing a principled foundation for improved CVC. Observing that generated images exhibit weak CVC while reconstructed images display strong CVC due to explicit rendering, we propose a soft-hard alignment strategy with distinct objectives for generation and reconstruction models. This approach not only enhances generation quality but also dramatically accelerates inference to as few as 4 steps. As a plug-and-play paradigm, our method, namely AlignCVC, seamlessly integrates various multi-view generation models with 3D reconstruction models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AlignCVC for single-image-to-3D generation.

  Reconstructing 3D braided hairstyles from single-view images remains a challenging task due to the intricate interwoven structure and complex topologies of braids. Existing strand-based hair reconstruction methods typically focus on loose hairstyles and often struggle to capture the fine-grained geometry of braided hair.

Leveraging a synthetic braid model inspired by braid theory, our approach effectively captures the complex intertwined structures of braids. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, providing superior accuracy, realism, and efficiency in reconstructing 3D braided hairstyles, supporting expressive hairstyle modeling in digital humans.

  3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful approach in novel view synthesis, delivering rapid training and rendering but at the cost of an ever-growing set of Gaussian primitives that strains memory and bandwidth. We introduce AutoOpti3DGS, a training-time framework that automatically restrains Gaussian proliferation without sacrificing visual fidelity. The key idea is to feed the input images to a sequence of learnable Forward and Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transforms, where low-pass filters are kept fixed, high-pass filters are learnable and initialized to zero, and an auxiliary orthogonality loss gradually activates fine frequencies. This wavelet-driven, coarse-to-fine process delays the formation of redundant fine Gaussians, allowing 3DGS to capture global structure first and refine detail only when necessary. Through extensive experiments, AutoOpti3DGS requires just a single filter learning-rate hyper-parameter, integrates seamlessly with existing efficient 3DGS frameworks, and consistently produces sparser scene representations more compatible with memory or storage-constrained hardware.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique that adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of parameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover ``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution, respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data, de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact, low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT). Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count and computation overhead.

  A single-pass driving clip frequently results in incomplete scanning of the road structure, making reconstructed scene expanding a critical requirement for sensor simulators to effectively regress driving actions. Although contemporary 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques achieve remarkable reconstruction quality, their direct extension through the integration of diffusion priors often introduces cumulative physical inconsistencies and compromises training efficiency. To address these limitations, we present RGE-GS, a novel expansive reconstruction framework that synergizes diffusion-based generation with reward-guided Gaussian integration. The RGE-GS framework incorporates two key innovations: First, we propose a reward network that learns to identify and prioritize consistently generated patterns prior to reconstruction phases, thereby enabling selective retention of diffusion outputs for spatial stability. Second, during the reconstruction process, we devise a differentiated training strategy that automatically adjust Gaussian optimization progress according to scene converge metrics, which achieving better convergence than baseline methods. Extensive evaluations of publicly available datasets demonstrate that RGE-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction quality.

  Metalenses offer significant potential for ultra-compact computational imaging but face challenges from complex optical degradation and computational restoration difficulties. Existing methods typically rely on precise optical calibration or massive paired datasets, which are non-trivial for real-world imaging systems. Furthermore, a lack of control over the inference process often results in undesirable hallucinated artifacts. We introduce Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for tunable metalens photography, leveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of large datasets. Our framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths to balance high-frequency detail generation, structural fidelity, and suppression of metalens-specific degradation, alongside \textit{pseudo} data augmentation. A tunable decoder enables controlled trade-offs between fidelity and perceptual quality. Additionally, a spatially varying degradation-aware attention (SVDA) module adaptively models complex optical and sensor-induced degradation. Finally, we design and build a millimeter-scale MetaCamera for real-world validation. Extensive results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-fidelity and sharp image reconstruction. More materials:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Part segmentation and motion estimation are two fundamental problems for articulated object motion analysis. In this paper, we present a method to solve these two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single articulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point clouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points. Instead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the object surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the object undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using measurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods that rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an alternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we represent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D Gaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations, translations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our representation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences between the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of each point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned Gaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point correspondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate real-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further demonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to existing approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are completely occluded in some time-steps. Notably, our part segmentation performance outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 13% on point clouds with occlusions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate image alignment is essential for monitoring crack evolution in structural health monitoring (SHM), particularly under real-world conditions involving perspective distortion, occlusion, and low contrast. However, traditional feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF, which rely on Gaussian-based scale spaces, tend to suppress high-frequency edges, making them unsuitable for thin crack localization. Lightweight binary alternatives like ORB and BRISK, while computationally efficient, often suffer from poor keypoint repeatability on textured or shadowed surfaces. This study presents a physics-informed alignment framework that adapts the open KAZE architecture to SHM-specific challenges. By utilizing nonlinear anisotropic diffusion to construct a crack-preserving scale space, and integrating RANSAC-based homography estimation, the framework enables accurate geometric correction without the need for training, parameter tuning, or prior calibration. The method is validated on time-lapse images of masonry and concrete acquired via handheld smartphone under varied field conditions, including shadow interference, cropping, oblique viewing angles, and surface clutter. Compared to classical detectors, the proposed framework reduces crack area and spine length errors by up to 70 percent and 90 percent, respectively, while maintaining sub-5 percent alignment error in key metrics. Unsupervised, interpretable, and computationally lightweight, this approach supports scalable deployment via UAVs and mobile platforms. By tailoring nonlinear scale-space modeling to SHM image alignment, this work offers a robust and physically grounded alternative to conventional techniques for tracking real-world crack evolution.

  Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image remains challenging, especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image, they typically assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object are occluded, resulting in degraded 3D reconstruction quality. We propose DeOcc-1-to-3, an end-to-end framework for occlusion-aware multi-view generation that synthesizes six structurally consistent novel views directly from a single occluded image, enabling reliable 3D reconstruction without prior inpainting or manual annotations. Our self-supervised training pipeline leverages occluded-unoccluded image pairs and pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware reconstruction, covering diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and masking patterns, providing a standardized protocol for future evaluation.

  Predicting mortality-related outcomes from images offers the prospect of accessible, noninvasive, and scalable health screening. We present a method that leverages pretrained vision transformer foundation models to estimate remaining lifespan from facial and whole-body images, alongside robust uncertainty quantification. We show that predictive uncertainty varies systematically with the true remaining lifespan, and that this uncertainty can be effectively modeled by learning a Gaussian distribution for each sample. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.48 years on an established dataset, and further improves to 4.79 and 5.07 years MAE on two new, higher-quality datasets curated and published in this work. Importantly, our models provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, as demonstrated by a bucketed expected calibration error of 0.62 years. While not intended for clinical deployment, these results highlight the potential of extracting medically relevant signals from images. We make all code and datasets available to facilitate further research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly detection (AD) is essential for industrial inspection and medical diagnosis, yet existing methods typically rely on ``comparing'' test images to normal references from a training set. However, variations in appearance and positioning often complicate the alignment of these references with the test image, limiting detection accuracy. We observe that most anomalies manifest as local variations, meaning that even within anomalous images, valuable normal information remains. We argue that this information is useful and may be more aligned with the anomalies since both the anomalies and the normal information originate from the same image. Therefore, rather than relying on external normality from the training set, we propose INP-Former, a novel method that extracts Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) directly from the test image. Specifically, we introduce the INP Extractor, which linearly combines normal tokens to represent INPs. We further propose an INP Coherence Loss to ensure INPs can faithfully represent normality for the testing image. These INPs then guide the INP-guided Decoder to reconstruct only normal tokens, with reconstruction errors serving as anomaly scores. Additionally, we propose a Soft Mining Loss to prioritize hard-to-optimize samples during training. INP-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-class, multi-class, and few-shot AD tasks across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD, positioning it as a versatile and universal solution for AD. Remarkably, INP-Former also demonstrates some zero-shot AD capability. Furthermore, we propose a soft version of the INP Coherence Loss and enhance INP-Former by incorporating residual learning, leading to the development of INP-Former++. The proposed method significantly improves detection performance across single-class, multi-class, semi-supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings.

  In recent years, implicit neural representations (INRs) have gained popularity in the computer vision community. This is mainly due to the strong performance of INRs in many computer vision tasks. These networks can extract a continuous signal representation given a discrete signal representation. In previous studies, it has been repeatedly shown that INR performance has a strong correlation with the activation functions used in its multilayer perceptrons. Although numerous activation functions have been proposed that are competitive with one another, they share some common set of challenges such as spectral bias(Lack of sensitivity to high-frequency content in signals), limited robustness to signal noise and difficulties in simultaneous capturing both local and global features. and furthermore, the requirement for manual parameter tuning. To address these issues, we introduce a novel activation function, Band Shifted Raised Cosine Activated Implicit Neural Networks $\textbf{(BandRC)}$ tailored to enhance signal representation capacity further. We also incorporate deep prior knowledge extracted from the signal to adjust the activation functions through a task-specific model. Through a mathematical analysis and a series of experiments which include image reconstruction (with an average PSNR improvement of +5.67 dB over the nearest counterpart across a diverse image dataset), denoising (with a +0.46 dB increase in PSNR), super-resolution (with a +1.03 dB improvement over the nearest State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) method for 6X super-resolution), inpainting, and 3D shape reconstruction we demonstrate the dominance of BandRC over existing state of the art activation functions.

  Low-light enhancement has wide applications in autonomous driving, 3D reconstruction, remote sensing, surveillance, and so on, which can significantly improve information utilization. However, most existing methods lack generalization and are limited to specific tasks such as image recovery. To address these issues, we propose Gated-Mechanism Mixture-of-Experts (GM-MoE), the first framework to introduce a mixture-of-experts network for low-light image enhancement. GM-MoE comprises a dynamic gated weight conditioning network and three sub-expert networks, each specializing in a distinct enhancement task. Combining a self-designed gated mechanism that dynamically adjusts the weights of the sub-expert networks for different data domains. Additionally, we integrate local and global feature fusion within sub-expert networks to enhance image quality by capturing multi-scale features. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-MoE achieves superior generalization with respect to 25 compared approaches, reaching state-of-the-art performance on PSNR on 5 benchmarks and SSIM on 4 benchmarks, respectively.

  Recent advancements in AI-generated content have significantly improved the realism of 3D and 4D generation. However, most existing methods prioritize appearance consistency while neglecting underlying physical principles, leading to artifacts such as unrealistic deformations, unstable dynamics, and implausible objects interactions. Incorporating physics priors into generative models has become a crucial research direction to enhance structural integrity and motion realism. This survey provides a review of physics-aware generative methods, systematically analyzing how physical constraints are integrated into 3D and 4D generation. First, we examine recent works in incorporating physical priors into static and dynamic 3D generation, categorizing methods based on representation types, including vision-based, NeRF-based, and Gaussian Splatting-based approaches. Second, we explore emerging techniques in 4D generation, focusing on methods that model temporal dynamics with physical simulations. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis of major methods, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and suitability for different materials and motion dynamics. By presenting an in-depth analysis of physics-grounded AIGC, this survey aims to bridge the gap between generative models and physical realism, providing insights that inspire future research in physically consistent content generation.

  Novel View Synthesis (NVS) techniques, notably Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), can augment camera pose estimation by extending and diversifying training data. However, images generated by these methods are often plagued by spatial artifacts such as blurring and ghosting, undermining their reliability as training data for camera pose estimation. This limitation is particularly critical for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which aim at pixel-level 3D coordinate estimation, because rendering artifacts directly lead to estimation inaccuracies. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-criteria filtering mechanism that dynamically identifies and discards suboptimal pixels during training. The dual-criteria filter evaluates two concurrent metrics: (1) real-time SCR reprojection error, and (2) gradient threshold, across the coordinate regression domain. In addition, for visual localization problems in sparse-input scenarios, it becomes even more necessary to use NVS-generated data to assist localization. We design a coarse-to-fine Points of Interest (PoI) variant using sparse-input NVS to solve this problem. Experiments across indoor and outdoor benchmarks confirm our method's efficacy, achieving state-of-the-art localization accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

  Gaussian-based human avatars have achieved an unprecedented level of visual fidelity. However, existing approaches based on high-capacity neural networks typically require a desktop GPU to achieve real-time performance for a single avatar, and it remains non-trivial to animate and render such avatars on mobile devices including a standalone VR headset due to substantially limited memory and computational bandwidth. In this paper, we present SqueezeMe, a simple and highly effective framework to convert high-fidelity 3D Gaussian full-body avatars into a lightweight representation that supports both animation and rendering with mobile-grade compute. Our key observation is that the decoding of pose-dependent Gaussian attributes from a neural network creates non-negligible memory and computational overhead. Inspired by blendshapes and linear pose correctives widely used in Computer Graphics, we address this by distilling the pose correctives learned with neural networks into linear layers. Moreover, we further reduce the parameters by sharing the correctives among nearby Gaussians. Combining them with a custom splatting pipeline based on Vulkan, we achieve, for the first time, simultaneous animation and rendering of 3 Gaussian avatars in real-time (72 FPS) on a Meta Quest 3 VR headset.

  Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) show impressive performance in photo-realistic free-view rendering of scenes. Recent improvements on the NeRF such as TensoRF and ZipNeRF employ explicit models for faster optimization and rendering, as compared to the NeRF that employs an implicit representation. However, both implicit and explicit radiance fields require dense sampling of images in the given scene. Their performance degrades significantly when only a sparse set of views is available. Researchers find that supervising the depth estimated by a radiance field helps train it effectively with fewer views. The depth supervision is obtained either using classical approaches or neural networks pre-trained on a large dataset. While the former may provide only sparse supervision, the latter may suffer from generalization issues. As opposed to the earlier approaches, we seek to learn the depth supervision by designing augmented models and training them along with the main radiance field. Further, we aim to design a framework of regularizations that can work across different implicit and explicit radiance fields. We observe that certain features of these radiance field models overfit to the observed images in the sparse-input scenario. Our key finding is that reducing the capability of the radiance fields with respect to positional encoding, the number of decomposed tensor components or the size of the hash table, constrains the model to learn simpler solutions, which estimate better depth in certain regions. By designing augmented models based on such reduced capabilities, we obtain better depth supervision for the main radiance field. We achieve state-of-the-art view-synthesis performance with sparse input views on popular datasets containing forward-facing and 360$^\circ$ scenes by employing the above regularizations.

  Resilience non-equilibrium measurement, the ability to maintain fundamental functionality amidst failures and errors, is crucial for scientific management and engineering applications of industrial chain. The problem is particularly challenging when the number or types of multiple co-evolution of resilience (for example, randomly placed) are extremely chaos. Existing end-to-end deep learning ordinarily do not generalize well to unseen full-feld reconstruction of spatiotemporal co-evolution structure, and predict resilience of network topology, especially in multiple chaos data regimes typically seen in real-world applications. To address this challenge, here we propose industrial brain, a human-like autonomous cognitive decision-making and planning framework integrating higher-order activity-driven neuro network and CT-OODA symbolic reasoning to autonomous plan resilience directly from observational data of global variable. The industrial brain not only understands and model structure of node activity dynamics and network co-evolution topology without simplifying assumptions, and reveal the underlying laws hidden behind complex networks, but also enabling accurate resilience prediction, inference, and planning. Experimental results show that industrial brain significantly outperforms resilience prediction and planning methods, with an accurate improvement of up to 10.8\% over GoT and OlaGPT framework and 11.03\% over spectral dimension reduction. It also generalizes to unseen topologies and dynamics and maintains robust performance despite observational disturbances. Our findings suggest that industrial brain addresses an important gap in resilience prediction and planning for industrial chain.

  Existing computer-use agents primarily focus on general-purpose desktop automation tasks, with limited exploration of their application in highly specialized domains. In particular, the 3D building modeling process in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector involves open-ended design tasks and complex interaction patterns within Building Information Modeling (BIM) authoring software, which has yet to be thoroughly addressed by current studies. In this paper, we propose BIMgent, an agentic framework powered by multimodal large language models (LLMs), designed to enable autonomous building model authoring via graphical user interface (GUI) operations. BIMgent automates the architectural building modeling process, including multimodal input for conceptual design, planning of software-specific workflows, and efficient execution of the authoring GUI actions. We evaluate BIMgent on real-world building modeling tasks, including both text-based conceptual design generation and reconstruction from existing building design. The design quality achieved by BIMgent was found to be reasonable. Its operations achieved a 32% success rate, whereas all baseline models failed to complete the tasks (0% success rate). Results demonstrate that BIMgent effectively reduces manual workload while preserving design intent, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in real-world architectural modeling scenarios.
