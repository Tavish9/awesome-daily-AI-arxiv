- **[SMOGAN: Synthetic Minority Oversampling with GAN Refinement for Imbalanced Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21152)**  `arXiv:2504.21152`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imbalanced regression refers to prediction tasks where the target variable is skewed. This skewness hinders machine learning models, especially neural networks, which concentrate on dense regions and therefore perform poorly on underrepresented (minority) samples. Despite the importance of this problem, only a few methods have been proposed for imbalanced regression. Many of the available solutions for imbalanced regression adapt techniques from the class imbalance domain, such as linear interpolation and the addition of Gaussian noise, to create synthetic data in sparse regions. However, in many cases, the underlying distribution of the data is complex and non-linear. Consequently, these approaches generate synthetic samples that do not accurately represent the true feature-target relationship. To overcome these limitations, we propose SMOGAN, a two-step oversampling framework for imbalanced regression. In Stage 1, an existing oversampler generates initial synthetic samples in sparse target regions. In Stage 2, we introduce DistGAN, a distribution-aware GAN that serves as SMOGAN's filtering layer and refines these samples via adversarial loss augmented with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy objective, aligning them with the true joint feature-target distribution. Extensive experiments on 23 imbalanced datasets show that SMOGAN consistently outperforms the default oversampling method without the DistGAN filtering layer.

- **[Modeling and Performance Analysis for Semantic Communications Based on Empirical Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21055)**  `arXiv:2504.21055`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  Due to the black-box characteristics of deep learning based semantic encoders and decoders, finding a tractable method for the performance analysis of semantic communications is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) formula to model the relationship between the end-to-end measurement and SNR, which can be applied for both image reconstruction tasks and inference tasks. Specifically, for image reconstruction tasks, the proposed ABG formula can well fit the commonly used DL networks, such as SCUNet, and Vision Transformer, for semantic encoding with the multi scale-structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM) measurement. Furthermore, we find that the upper bound of the MS-SSIM depends on the number of quantized output bits of semantic encoders, and we also propose a closed-form expression to fit the relationship between the MS-SSIM and quantized output bits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical expression between end-to-end performance metrics and SNR for semantic communications. Based on the proposed ABG formula, we investigate an adaptive power control scheme for semantic communications over random fading channels, which can effectively guarantee quality of service (QoS) for semantic communications, and then design the optimal power allocation scheme to maximize the energy efficiency of the semantic communication system. Furthermore, by exploiting the bisection algorithm, we develop the power allocation scheme to maximize the minimum QoS of multiple users for OFDMA downlink semantic communication Extensive simulations verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ABG formula and power allocation schemes.

- **[Downscaling Extreme Precipitation with Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00381)**  `arXiv:2410.00381`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yuhao Liu, James Doss-Gollin, Qiushi Dai, Guha Balakrishnan, Ashok Veeraraghavan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the risks posed by extreme rainfall events necessitates both high-resolution products (to assess localized hazards) and extensive historical records (to capture rare occurrences). Radar and mesonet networks provide kilometer-scale precipitation fields, but with limited historical records and geographical coverage. Conversely, global gauge and blended products span decades, yet their coarse 30-50 km grids obscure local extremes. This work introduces Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion (WassDiff), a generative downscaling framework that integrates diffusion modeling with a distribution-matching (Wasserstein) regularizer, suppressing bias throughout the entire generative denoising process. Conditioned on 55 km CPC gauge-based precipitation and the 31 km ERA5 reanalysis, WassDiff generates 1 km precipitation estimates that remain well-calibrated to targets across the full intensity range, including the extremes. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that WassDiff outperforms existing state-of-the-art downscaling methods, delivering lower reconstruction error and reduced bias. Case studies further demonstrate its ability to reproduce realistic fine-scale structures and accurate peak intensities from extreme weather phenomena, such as tropical storms and cold fronts. By unlocking decades of high-resolution rainfall information from globally available coarse records, WassDiff offers a practical pathway toward more accurate flood-risk assessments and climate-adaptation planning.

- **[Synergy-CLIP: Extending CLIP with Multi-modal Integration for Robust Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21375)**  `arXiv:2504.21375`  `cs.LG`  
  _Sangyeon Cho, Jangyeong Jeon, Mingi Kim, Junyeong Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modal representation learning has become a pivotal area in artificial intelligence, enabling the integration of diverse modalities such as vision, text, and audio to solve complex problems. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on bimodal interactions, such as image-text pairs, which limits their ability to fully exploit the richness of multi-modal data. Furthermore, the integration of modalities in equal-scale environments remains underexplored due to the challenges of constructing large-scale, balanced datasets. In this study, we propose Synergy-CLIP, a novel framework that extends the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) architecture to enhance multi-modal representation learning by integrating visual, textual, and audio modalities. Unlike existing methods that focus on adapting individual modalities to vanilla-CLIP, Synergy-CLIP aligns and captures latent information across three modalities equally. To address the high cost of constructing large-scale multi-modal datasets, we introduce VGG-sound+, a triple-modal dataset designed to provide equal-scale representation of visual, textual, and audio data. Synergy-CLIP is validated on various downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, where it outperforms existing baselines. Additionally, we introduce a missing modality reconstruction task, demonstrating Synergy-CLIP's ability to extract synergy among modalities in realistic application scenarios. These contributions provide a robust foundation for advancing multi-modal representation learning and exploring new research directions.

- **[Gaussian process surrogate model to approximate power grid simulators -- An application to the certification of a congestion management controller](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00094)**  `arXiv:2503.00094`  `cs.LG`  
  _Pierre Houdouin, Lucas Saludjian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the digitalization of power grids, physical equations become insufficient to describe the network's behavior, and realistic but time-consuming simulators must be used. Numerical experiments, such as safety validation, that involve simulating a large number of scenarios become computationally intractable. A popular solution to reduce the computational burden is to learn a surrogate model of the simulator with Machine Learning (ML) and then conduct the experiment directly on the fast-to-evaluate surrogate model. Among the various ML possibilities for building surrogate models, Gaussian processes (GPs) emerged as a popular solution due to their flexibility, data efficiency, and interpretability. Their probabilistic nature enables them to provide both predictions and uncertainty quantification (UQ). This paper starts with a discussion on the interest of using GPs to approximate power grid simulators and fasten numerical experiments. Such simulators, however, often violate the GP's underlying Gaussian assumption, leading to poor approximations. To address this limitation, an approach that consists in adding an adaptive residual uncertainty term to the UQ is proposed. It enables the GP to remain accurate and reliable despite the simulator's non-Gaussian behaviors. This approach is successfully applied to the certification of the proper functioning of a congestion management controller, with over 98% of simulations avoided.

- **[Anomaly-Driven Approach for Enhanced Prostate Cancer Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21789)**  `arXiv:2504.21789`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Alessia Hu, Regina Beets-Tan, Lishan Cai, Eduardo Pooch_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays an important role in identifying clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), yet automated methods face challenges such as data imbalance, variable tumor sizes, and a lack of annotated data. This study introduces Anomaly-Driven U-Net (adU-Net), which incorporates anomaly maps derived from biparametric MRI sequences into a deep learning-based segmentation framework to improve csPCa identification. We conduct a comparative analysis of anomaly detection methods and evaluate the integration of anomaly maps into the segmentation pipeline. Anomaly maps, generated using Fixed-Point GAN reconstruction, highlight deviations from normal prostate tissue, guiding the segmentation model to potential cancerous regions. We compare the performance by using the average score, computed as the mean of the AUROC and Average Precision (AP). On the external test set, adU-Net achieves the best average score of 0.618, outperforming the baseline nnU-Net model (0.605). The results demonstrate that incorporating anomaly detection into segmentation improves generalization and performance, particularly with ADC-based anomaly maps, offering a promising direction for automated csPCa identification.

- **[Enhancing Self-Supervised Fine-Grained Video Object Tracking with Dynamic Memory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21692)**  `arXiv:2504.21692`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Zihan Zhou, Changrui Dai, Aibo Song, Xiaolin Fang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Successful video analysis relies on accurate recognition of pixels across frames, and frame reconstruction methods based on video correspondence learning are popular due to their efficiency. Existing frame reconstruction methods, while efficient, neglect the value of direct involvement of multiple reference frames for reconstruction and decision-making aspects, especially in complex situations such as occlusion or fast movement. In this paper, we introduce a Dynamic Memory Prediction (DMP) framework that innovatively utilizes multiple reference frames to concisely and directly enhance frame reconstruction. Its core component is a Reference Frame Memory Engine that dynamically selects frames based on object pixel features to improve tracking accuracy. In addition, a Bidirectional Target Prediction Network is built to utilize multiple reference frames to improve the robustness of the model. Through experiments, our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised techniques on two fine-grained video object tracking tasks: object segmentation and keypoint tracking.

- **[Revisiting Diffusion Autoencoder Training for Image Reconstruction Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21368)**  `arXiv:2504.21368`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Pramook Khungurn, Sukit Seripanitkarn, Phonphrm Thawatdamrongkit, Supasorn Suwajanakorn_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion autoencoders (DAEs) are typically formulated as a noise prediction model and trained with a linear-$\beta$ noise schedule that spends much of its sampling steps at high noise levels. Because high noise levels are associated with recovering large-scale image structures and low noise levels with recovering details, this configuration can result in low-quality and blurry images. However, it should be possible to improve details while spending fewer steps recovering structures because the latent code should already contain structural information. Based on this insight, we propose a new DAE training method that improves the quality of reconstructed images. We divide training into two phases. In the first phase, the DAE is trained as a vanilla autoencoder by always setting the noise level to the highest, forcing the encoder and decoder to populate the latent code with structural information. In the second phase, we incorporate a noise schedule that spends more time in the low-noise region, allowing the DAE to learn how to perfect the details. Our method results in images that have accurate high-level structures and low-level details while still preserving useful properties of the latent codes.

- **[Dance Style Recognition Using Laban Movement Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21166)**  `arXiv:2504.21166`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Muhammad Turab, Philippe Colantoni, Damien Muselet, Alain Tremeau_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing interest in automated movement analysis has presented new challenges in recognition of complex human activities including dance. This study focuses on dance style recognition using features extracted using Laban Movement Analysis. Previous studies for dance style recognition often focus on cross-frame movement analysis, which limits the ability to capture temporal context and dynamic transitions between movements. This gap highlights the need for a method that can add temporal context to LMA features. For this, we introduce a novel pipeline which combines 3D pose estimation, 3D human mesh reconstruction, and floor aware body modeling to effectively extract LMA features. To address the temporal limitation, we propose a sliding window approach that captures movement evolution across time in features. These features are then used to train various machine learning methods for classification, and their explainability explainable AI methods to evaluate the contribution of each feature to classification performance. Our proposed method achieves a highest classification accuracy of 99.18\% which shows that the addition of temporal context significantly improves dance style recognition performance.

  Visual text is a crucial component in both document and scene images, conveying rich semantic information and attracting significant attention in the computer vision community. Beyond traditional tasks such as text detection and recognition, visual text processing has witnessed rapid advancements driven by the emergence of foundation models, including text image reconstruction and text image manipulation. Despite significant progress, challenges remain due to the unique properties that differentiate text from general objects. Effectively capturing and leveraging these distinct textual characteristics is essential for developing robust visual text processing models. In this survey, we present a comprehensive, multi-perspective analysis of recent advancements in visual text processing, focusing on two key questions: (1) What textual features are most suitable for different visual text processing tasks? (2) How can these distinctive text features be effectively incorporated into processing frameworks? Furthermore, we introduce VTPBench, a new benchmark that encompasses a broad range of visual text processing datasets. Leveraging the advanced visual quality assessment capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we propose VTPScore, a novel evaluation metric designed to ensure fair and reliable evaluation. Our empirical study with more than 20 specific models reveals substantial room for improvement in the current techniques. Our aim is to establish this work as a fundamental resource that fosters future exploration and innovation in the dynamic field of visual text processing.

- **[HoloTime: Taming Video Diffusion Models for Panoramic 4D Scene Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21650)**  `arXiv:2504.21650`  `cs.CV`

  The rapid advancement of diffusion models holds the promise of revolutionizing the application of VR and AR technologies, which typically require scene-level 4D assets for user experience. Nonetheless, existing diffusion models predominantly concentrate on modeling static 3D scenes or object-level dynamics, constraining their capacity to provide truly immersive experiences. To address this issue, we propose HoloTime, a framework that integrates video diffusion models to generate panoramic videos from a single prompt or reference image, along with a 360-degree 4D scene reconstruction method that seamlessly transforms the generated panoramic video into 4D assets, enabling a fully immersive 4D experience for users. Specifically, to tame video diffusion models for generating high-fidelity panoramic videos, we introduce the 360World dataset, the first comprehensive collection of panoramic videos suitable for downstream 4D scene reconstruction tasks. With this curated dataset, we propose Panoramic Animator, a two-stage image-to-video diffusion model that can convert panoramic images into high-quality panoramic videos. Following this, we present Panoramic Space-Time Reconstruction, which leverages a space-time depth estimation method to transform the generated panoramic videos into 4D point clouds, enabling the optimization of a holistic 4D Gaussian Splatting representation to reconstruct spatially and temporally consistent 4D scenes. To validate the efficacy of our method, we conducted a comparative analysis with existing approaches, revealing its superiority in both panoramic video generation and 4D scene reconstruction. This demonstrates our method's capability to create more engaging and realistic immersive environments, thereby enhancing user experiences in VR and AR applications.

- **[Robust Orthogonal NMF with Label Propagation for Image Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21472)**  `arXiv:2504.21472`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jingjing Liu, Nian Wu, Xianchao Xiu, Jianhua Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular unsupervised learning approach widely used in image clustering. However, in real-world clustering scenarios, most existing NMF methods are highly sensitive to noise corruption and are unable to effectively leverage limited supervised information. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a unified non-convex framework with label propagation called robust orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization (RONMF). This method not only considers the graph Laplacian and label propagation as regularization terms but also introduces a more effective non-convex structure to measure the reconstruction error and imposes orthogonal constraints on the basis matrix to reduce the noise corruption, thereby achieving higher robustness. To solve RONMF, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based optimization algorithm. In particular, all subproblems have closed-form solutions, which ensures its efficiency. Experimental evaluations on eight public image datasets demonstrate that the proposed RONMF outperforms state-of-the-art NMF methods across various standard metrics and shows excellent robustness. The code will be available atthis https URL.

- **[Multiview Point Cloud Registration via Optimization in an Autoencoder Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21467)**  `arXiv:2504.21467`  `cs.CV`  
  _Luc Vedrenne, Sylvain Faisan, Denis Fortun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Point cloud rigid registration is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision. In the multiview case, we aim to find a set of 6D poses to align a set of objects. Methods based on pairwise registration rely on a subsequent synchronization algorithm, which makes them poorly scalable with the number of views. Generative approaches overcome this limitation, but are based on Gaussian Mixture Models and use an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Hence, they are not well suited to handle large transformations. Moreover, most existing methods cannot handle high levels of degradations. In this paper, we introduce POLAR (POint cloud LAtent Registration), a multiview registration method able to efficiently deal with a large number of views, while being robust to a high level of degradations and large initial angles. To achieve this, we transpose the registration problem into the latent space of a pretrained autoencoder, design a loss taking degradations into account, and develop an efficient multistart optimization strategy. Our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on synthetic and real data. POLAR is available atthis http URLor as a standalone package which can be installed with pip install polaregistration.

- **[Subject Information Extraction for Novelty Detection with Domain Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21247)**  `arXiv:2504.21247`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yangyang Qu, Dazhi Fu, Jicong Fan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised novelty detection (UND), aimed at identifying novel samples, is essential in fields like medical diagnosis, cybersecurity, and industrial quality control. Most existing UND methods assume that the training data and testing normal data originate from the same domain and only consider the distribution variation between training data and testing data. However, in real scenarios, it is common for normal testing and training data to originate from different domains, a challenge known as domain shift. The discrepancies between training and testing data often lead to incorrect classification of normal data as novel by existing methods. A typical situation is that testing normal data and training data describe the same subject, yet they differ in the background conditions. To address this problem, we introduce a novel method that separates subject information from background variation encapsulating the domain information to enhance detection performance under domain shifts. The proposed method minimizes the mutual information between the representations of the subject and background while modelling the background variation using a deep Gaussian mixture model, where the novelty detection is conducted on the subject representations solely and hence is not affected by the variation of domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generalizes effectively to unseen domains and significantly outperforms baseline methods, especially under substantial domain shifts between training and testing data.

- **[MoBGS: Motion Deblurring Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting for Blurry Monocular Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15122)**  `arXiv:2504.15122`  `cs.CV`  
  _Minh-Quan Viet Bui, Jongmin Park, Juan Luis Gonzalez Bello, Jaeho Moon, Jihyong Oh, Munchurl Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present MoBGS, a novel deblurring dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework capable of reconstructing sharp and high-quality novel spatio-temporal views from blurry monocular videos in an end-to-end manner. Existing dynamic novel view synthesis (NVS) methods are highly sensitive to motion blur in casually captured videos, resulting in significant degradation of rendering quality. While recent approaches address motion-blurred inputs for NVS, they primarily focus on static scene reconstruction and lack dedicated motion modeling for dynamic objects. To overcome these limitations, our MoBGS introduces a novel Blur-adaptive Latent Camera Estimation (BLCE) method for effective latent camera trajectory estimation, improving global camera motion deblurring. In addition, we propose a physically-inspired Latent Camera-induced Exposure Estimation (LCEE) method to ensure consistent deblurring of both global camera and local object motion. Our MoBGS framework ensures the temporal consistency of unseen latent timestamps and robust motion decomposition of static and dynamic regions. Extensive experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and real-world blurry videos show that our MoBGS significantly outperforms the very recent advanced methods (DyBluRF and Deblur4DGS), achieving state-of-the-art performance for dynamic NVS under motion blur.

  _Ling Yang, Kaixin Zhu, Juanxi Tian, Bohan Zeng, Mingbao Lin, Hongjuan Pei, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid development of 3D reconstruction technology, research in 4D reconstruction is also advancing, existing 4D reconstruction methods can generate high-quality 4D scenes. However, due to the challenges in acquiring multi-view video data, the current 4D reconstruction benchmarks mainly display actions performed in place, such as dancing, within limited scenarios. In practical scenarios, many scenes involve wide-range spatial movements, highlighting the limitations of existing 4D reconstruction datasets. Additionally, existing 4D reconstruction methods rely on deformation fields to estimate the dynamics of 3D objects, but deformation fields struggle with wide-range spatial movements, which limits the ability to achieve high-quality 4D scene reconstruction with wide-range spatial movements. In this paper, we focus on 4D scene reconstruction with significant object spatial movements and propose a novel 4D reconstruction benchmark, WideRange4D. This benchmark includes rich 4D scene data with large spatial variations, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of the generation capabilities of 4D generation methods. Furthermore, we introduce a new 4D reconstruction method, Progress4D, which generates stable and high-quality 4D results across various complex 4D scene reconstruction tasks. We conduct both quantitative and qualitative comparison experiments on WideRange4D, showing that our Progress4D outperforms existing state-of-the-art 4D reconstruction methods. Project:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning to understand dynamic 3D scenes from imagery is crucial for applications ranging from robotics to scene reconstruction. Yet, unlike other problems where large-scale supervised training has enabled rapid progress, directly supervising methods for recovering 3D motion remains challenging due to the fundamental difficulty of obtaining ground truth annotations. We present a system for mining high-quality 4D reconstructions from internet stereoscopic, wide-angle videos. Our system fuses and filters the outputs of camera pose estimation, stereo depth estimation, and temporal tracking methods into high-quality dynamic 3D reconstructions. We use this method to generate large-scale data in the form of world-consistent, pseudo-metric 3D point clouds with long-term motion trajectories. We demonstrate the utility of this data by training a variant of DUSt3R to predict structure and 3D motion from real-world image pairs, showing that training on our reconstructed data enables generalization to diverse real-world scenes.

- **[VecFontSDF: Learning to Reconstruct and Synthesize High-quality Vector Fonts via Signed Distance Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12675)**  `arXiv:2303.12675`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zeqing Xia, Bojun Xiong, Zhouhui Lian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Font design is of vital importance in the digital content design and modern printing industry. Developing algorithms capable of automatically synthesizing vector fonts can significantly facilitate the font design process. However, existing methods mainly concentrate on raster image generation, and only a few approaches can directly synthesize vector fonts. This paper proposes an end-to-end trainable method, VecFontSDF, to reconstruct and synthesize high-quality vector fonts using signed distance functions (SDFs). Specifically, based on the proposed SDF-based implicit shape representation, VecFontSDF learns to model each glyph as shape primitives enclosed by several parabolic curves, which can be precisely converted to quadratic B√©zier curves that are widely used in vector font products. In this manner, most image generation methods can be easily extended to synthesize vector fonts. Qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on a publicly-available dataset demonstrate that our method obtains high-quality results on several tasks, including vector font reconstruction, interpolation, and few-shot vector font synthesis, markedly outperforming the state of the art.
