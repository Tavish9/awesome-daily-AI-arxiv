  Object search in large-scale, unstructured environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, particularly in dynamic or expansive settings such as outdoor autonomous exploration. This task requires robust spatial reasoning and the ability to leverage prior experiences. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong semantic capabilities, their application in embodied contexts is limited by a grounding gap in spatial reasoning and insufficient mechanisms for memory integration and decisionthis http URLaddress these challenges, we propose GET (Goal-directed Exploration and Targeting), a framework that enhances object search by combining LLM-based reasoning with experience-guided exploration. At its core is DoUT (Diagram of Unified Thought), a reasoning module that facilitates real-time decision-making through a role-based feedback loop, integrating task-specific criteria and external memory. For repeated tasks, GET maintains a probabilistic task map based on a Gaussian Mixture Model, allowing for continual updates to object-location priors as environmentsthis http URLconducted in real-world, large-scale environments demonstrate that GET improves search efficiency and robustness across multiple LLMs and task settings, significantly outperforming heuristic and LLM-only baselines. These results suggest that structured LLM integration provides a scalable and generalizable approach to embodied decision-making in complex environments.

- **[Latent label distribution grid representation for modeling uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21180)**  `arXiv:2505.21180`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although \textbf{L}abel \textbf{D}istribution \textbf{L}earning (LDL) has promising representation capabilities for characterizing the polysemy of an instance, the complexity and high cost of the label distribution annotation lead to inexact in the construction of the label space. The existence of a large number of inexact labels generates a label space with uncertainty, which misleads the LDL algorithm to yield incorrect decisions. To alleviate this problem, we model the uncertainty of label distributions by constructing a \textbf{L}atent \textbf{L}abel \textbf{D}istribution \textbf{G}rid (LLDG) to form a low-noise representation space. Specifically, we first construct a label correlation matrix based on the differences between labels, and then expand each value of the matrix into a vector that obeys a Gaussian distribution, thus building a LLDG to model the uncertainty of the label space. Finally, the LLDG is reconstructed by the LLDG-Mixer to generate an accurate label distribution. Note that we enforce a customized low-rank scheme on this grid, which assumes that the label relations may be noisy and it needs to perform noise-reduction with the help of a Tucker reconstruction technique. Furthermore, we attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of the LLDG by considering its generation as an upstream task to achieve the classification of the objects. Extensive experimental results show that our approach performs competitively on several benchmarks.

  In recent years, generative models have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse fields, including images, videos, language, and decision-making. By applying powerful generative models such as flow-based models to reinforcement learning, we can effectively model complex multi-modal action distributions and achieve superior robotic control in continuous action spaces, surpassing the limitations of single-modal action distributions with traditional Gaussian-based policies. Previous methods usually adopt the generative models as behavior models to fit state-conditioned action distributions from datasets, with policy optimization conducted separately through additional policies using value-based sample weighting or gradient-based updates. However, this separation prevents the simultaneous optimization of multi-modal distribution fitting and policy improvement, ultimately hindering the training of models and degrading the performance. To address this issue, we propose Decision Flow, a unified framework that integrates multi-modal action distribution modeling and policy optimization. Specifically, our method formulates the action generation procedure of flow-based models as a flow decision-making process, where each action generation step corresponds to one flow decision. Consequently, our method seamlessly optimizes the flow policy while capturing multi-modal action distributions. We provide rigorous proofs of Decision Flow and validate the effectiveness through extensive experiments across dozens of offline RL environments. Compared with established offline RL baselines, the results demonstrate that our method achieves or matches the SOTA performance.

  Model merging dramatically reduces storage and computational resources by combining multiple expert models into a single multi-task model. Although recent model merging methods have shown promising results, they struggle to maintain performance gains as the number of merged models increases. In this paper, we investigate the key obstacles that limit the scalability of model merging when integrating a large number of expert models. First, we prove that there is an upper bound on model merging. Further theoretical analysis reveals that the limited effective parameter space imposes a strict constraint on the number of models that can be successfully merged. Gaussian Width shows that the marginal benefit of merging additional models diminishes according to a strictly concave function. This implies that the effective parameter space becomes rapidly saturated as the number of merged models increases. Furthermore, using Approximate Kinematics Theory, we prove the existence of a unique optimal threshold beyond which adding more models does not yield significant performance improvements. At the same time, we introduce a straightforward Reparameterized Heavy-Tailed method (RHT) to extend the coverage of the merged model, thereby enhancing its performance. Empirical results on 12 benchmarks, including both knowledge-intensive and general-purpose tasks, validate our theoretical analysis. We believe that these results spark further research beyond the current scope of model merging. The source code is in the anonymous Github repositorythis https URL.

- **[Active Learning for Multiple Change Point Detection in Non-stationary Time Series with Deep Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20452)**  `arXiv:2505.20452`  `cs.LG`  
  _Hao Zhao, Rong Pan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multiple change point (MCP) detection in non-stationary time series is challenging due to the variety of underlying patterns. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm that integrates Active Learning (AL) with Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) for robust MCP detection. Our method leverages spectral analysis to identify potential changes and employs AL to strategically select new sampling points for improved efficiency. By incorporating the modeling flexibility of DGPs with the change-identification capabilities of spectral methods, our approach adapts to diverse spectral change behaviors and effectively localizes multiple change points. Experiments on both simulated and real-world data demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in terms of detection accuracy and sampling efficiency for non-stationary time series.

- **[Low-Rank Adapting Models for Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19406)**  `arXiv:2501.19406`  `cs.LG`  
  _Matthew Chen, Joshua Engels, Max Tegmark_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose language model representations into a sparse set of linear latent vectors. Recent works have improved SAEs using language model gradients, but these techniques require many expensive backward passes during training and still cause a significant increase in cross entropy loss when SAE reconstructions are inserted into the model. In this work, we improve on these limitations by taking a fundamentally different approach: we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the \textit{language model itself} around a previously trained SAE. We analyze our method across SAE sparsity, SAE width, language model size, LoRA rank, and model layer on the Gemma Scope family of SAEs. In these settings, our method reduces the cross entropy loss gap by 30\% to 55\% when SAEs are inserted during the forward pass. We also find that compared to end-to-end (e2e) SAEs, our approach achieves the same downstream cross entropy loss 3$\times$ to 20$\times$ faster on \gemma and 2$\times$ to 10$\times$ faster on \llama. We further show that our technique improves downstream metrics and can adapt multiple SAEs at once without harming general language model capabilities. Our results demonstrate that improving model interpretability is not limited to post-hoc SAE training; Pareto improvements can also be achieved by directly optimizing the model itself.

- **[OmniIndoor3D: Comprehensive Indoor 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20610)**  `arXiv:2505.20610`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Xiaobao Wei, Xiaoan Zhang, Hao Wang, Qingpo Wuwu, Ming Lu, Wenzhao Zheng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel framework for comprehensive indoor 3D reconstruction using Gaussian representations, called OmniIndoor3D. This framework enables accurate appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction of diverse indoor scenes captured by a consumer-level RGB-D camera. Since 3DGS is primarily optimized for photorealistic rendering, it lacks the precise geometry critical for high-quality panoptic reconstruction. Therefore, OmniIndoor3D first combines multiple RGB-D images to create a coarse 3D reconstruction, which is then used to initialize the 3D Gaussians and guide the 3DGS training. To decouple the optimization conflict between appearance and geometry, we introduce a lightweight MLP that adjusts the geometric properties of 3D Gaussians. The introduced lightweight MLP serves as a low-pass filter for geometry reconstruction and significantly reduces noise in indoor scenes. To improve the distribution of Gaussian primitives, we propose a densification strategy guided by panoptic priors to encourage smoothness on planar surfaces. Through the joint optimization of appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction, OmniIndoor3D provides comprehensive 3D indoor scene understanding, which facilitates accurate and robust robotic navigation. We perform thorough evaluations across multiple datasets, and OmniIndoor3D achieves state-of-the-art results in appearance, geometry, and panoptic reconstruction. We believe our work bridges a critical gap in indoor 3D reconstruction. The code will be released at:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-based tactile sensing has been widely used in perception, reconstruction, and robotic manipulation. However, collecting large-scale tactile data remains costly due to the localized nature of sensor-object interactions and inconsistencies across sensor instances. Existing approaches to scaling tactile data, such as simulation and free-form tactile generation, often suffer from unrealistic output and poor transferability to downstreamthis http URLaddress this, we propose ControlTac, a two-stage controllable framework that generates realistic tactile images conditioned on a single reference tactile image, contact force, and contact position. With those physical priors as control input, ControlTac generates physically plausible and varied tactile images that can be used for effective data augmentation. Through experiments on three downstream tasks, we demonstrate that ControlTac can effectively augment tactile datasets and lead to consistent gains. Our three real-world experiments further validate the practical utility of our approach. Project page:this https URL.

- **[Integrating Intermediate Layer Optimization and Projected Gradient Descent for Solving Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20789)**  `arXiv:2505.20789`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Yang Zheng, Wen Li, Zhaoqiang Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inverse problems (IPs) involve reconstructing signals from noisy observations. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted priors, which can fail to capture the complexity of real-world data. The advent of pre-trained generative models has introduced new paradigms, offering improved reconstructions by learning rich priors from data. Among these, diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful framework, achieving remarkable reconstruction performance across numerous IPs. However, existing DM-based methods frequently encounter issues such as heavy computational demands and suboptimal convergence. In this work, building upon the idea of the recent work DMPlug~\cite{wang2024dmplug}, we propose two novel methods, DMILO and DMILO-PGD, to address these challenges. Our first method, DMILO, employs intermediate layer optimization (ILO) to alleviate the memory burden inherent in DMPlug. Additionally, by introducing sparse deviations, we expand the range of DMs, enabling the exploration of underlying signals that may lie outside the range of the diffusion model. We further propose DMILO-PGD, which integrates ILO with projected gradient descent (PGD), thereby reducing the risk of suboptimal convergence. We provide an intuitive theoretical analysis of our approach under appropriate conditions and validate its superiority through extensive experiments on diverse image datasets, encompassing both linear and nonlinear IPs. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of DMILO and DMILO-PGD in addressing common challenges in DM-based IP solvers.

- **[LeDiFlow: Learned Distribution-guided Flow Matching to Accelerate Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20723)**  `arXiv:2505.20723`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Enhancing the efficiency of high-quality image generation using Diffusion Models (DMs) is a significant challenge due to the iterative nature of the process. Flow Matching (FM) is emerging as a powerful generative modeling paradigm based on a simulation-free training objective instead of a score-based one used in DMs. Typical FM approaches rely on a Gaussian distribution prior, which induces curved, conditional probability paths between the prior and target data distribution. These curved paths pose a challenge for the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver, requiring a large number of inference calls to the flow prediction network. To address this issue, we present Learned Distribution-guided Flow Matching (LeDiFlow), a novel scalable method for training FM-based image generation models using a better-suited prior distribution learned via a regression-based auxiliary model. By initializing the ODE solver with a prior closer to the target data distribution, LeDiFlow enables the learning of more computationally tractable probability paths. These paths directly translate to fewer solver steps needed for high-quality image generation at inference time. Our method utilizes a State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) transformer architecture combined with latent space sampling and can be trained on a consumer workstation. We empirically demonstrate that LeDiFlow remarkably outperforms the respective FM baselines. For instance, when operating directly on pixels, our model accelerates inference by up to 3.75x compared to the corresponding pixel-space baseline. Simultaneously, our latent FM model enhances image quality on average by 1.32x in CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) metric against its respective baseline.

- **[MetaGS: A Meta-Learned Gaussian-Phong Model for Out-of-Distribution 3D Scene Relighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20791)**  `arXiv:2405.20791`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Yumeng He, Yunbo Wang, Xiaokang Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-distribution (OOD) 3D relighting requires novel view synthesis under unseen lighting conditions that differ significantly from the observed images. Existing relighting methods, which assume consistent light source distributions between training and testing, often degrade in OOD scenarios. We introduce MetaGS to tackle this challenge from two perspectives. First, we propose a meta-learning approach to train 3D Gaussian splatting, which explicitly promotes learning generalizable Gaussian geometries and appearance attributes across diverse lighting conditions, even with biased training data. Second, we embed fundamental physical priors from the Blinn-Phong reflection model into Gaussian splatting, which enhances the decoupling of shading components and leads to more accurate 3D scene reconstruction. Results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaGS in challenging OOD relighting tasks, supporting efficient point-light relighting and generalizing well to unseen environment lighting maps.

  _Nils Neukirch, Johanna Vielhaben, Nils Strodthoff_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Internal representations are crucial for understanding deep neural networks, such as their properties and reasoning patterns, but remain difficult to interpret. While mapping from feature space to input space aids in interpreting the former, existing approaches often rely on crude approximations. We propose using a conditional diffusion model - a pretrained high-fidelity diffusion model conditioned on spatially resolved feature maps - to learn such a mapping in a probabilistic manner. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach across various pretrained image classifiers from CNNs to ViTs, showing excellent reconstruction capabilities. Through qualitative comparisons and robustness analysis, we validate our method and showcase possible applications, such as the visualization of concept steering in input space or investigations of the composite nature of the feature space. This approach has broad potential for improving feature space understanding in computer vision models.

  _Jinbao Wang, Hanzhe Liang, Can Gao, Chenxi Hu, Jie Zhou, Yunkang Cao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal feature reconstruction is a promising approach for 3D anomaly detection, leveraging the complementary information from dual modalities. We further advance this paradigm by utilizing multi-modal mentor learning, which fuses intermediate features to further distinguish normal from feature differences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called Mentor3AD, which utilizes multi-modal mentor learning. By leveraging the shared features of different modalities, Mentor3AD can extract more effective features and guide feature reconstruction, ultimately improving detection performance. Specifically, Mentor3AD includes a Mentor of Fusion Module (MFM) that merges features extracted from RGB and 3D modalities to create a mentor feature. Additionally, we have designed a Mentor of Guidance Module (MGM) to facilitate cross-modal reconstruction, supported by the mentor feature. Lastly, we introduce a Voting Module (VM) to more accurately generate the final anomaly score. Extensive comparative and ablation studies on MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **[ZigzagPointMamba: Spatial-Semantic Mamba for Point Cloud Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21381)**  `arXiv:2505.21381`  `cs.CV`  
  _Linshuang Diao, Dayong Ren, Sensen Song, Yurong Qian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State Space models (SSMs) such as PointMamba enable efficient feature extraction for point cloud self-supervised learning with linear complexity, outperforming Transformers in computational efficiency. However, existing PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking, which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens. This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of ScanObjectNN.

- **[Empowering Vector Graphics with Consistently Arbitrary Viewing and View-dependent Visibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21377)**  `arXiv:2505.21377`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yidi Li, Jun Xiao, Zhengda Lu, Yiqun Wang, Haiyong Jiang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work presents a novel text-to-vector graphics generation approach, Dream3DVG, allowing for arbitrary viewpoint viewing, progressive detail optimization, and view-dependent occlusion awareness. Our approach is a dual-branch optimization framework, consisting of an auxiliary 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization branch and a 3D vector graphics optimization branch. The introduced 3DGS branch can bridge the domain gaps between text prompts and vector graphics with more consistent guidance. Moreover, 3DGS allows for progressive detail control by scheduling classifier-free guidance, facilitating guiding vector graphics with coarse shapes at the initial stages and finer details at later stages. We also improve the view-dependent occlusions by devising a visibility-awareness rendering module. Extensive results on 3D sketches and 3D iconographies, demonstrate the superiority of the method on different abstraction levels of details, cross-view consistency, and occlusion-aware stroke culling.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Plenodium (plenoptic medium), an effective and efficient 3D representation framework capable of jointly modeling both objects and participating media. In contrast to existing medium representations that rely solely on view-dependent modeling, our novel plenoptic medium representation incorporates both directional and positional information through spherical harmonics encoding, enabling highly accurate underwater scene reconstruction. To address the initialization challenge in degraded underwater environments, we propose the pseudo-depth Gaussian complementation to augment COLMAP-derived point clouds with robust depth priors. In addition, a depth ranking regularized loss is developed to optimize the geometry of the scene and improve the ordinal consistency of the depth maps. Extensive experiments on real-world underwater datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, we conduct a simulated dataset with ground truth and the controllable scattering medium to demonstrate the restoration capability of our method in underwater scenarios. Our code and dataset are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Novel view synthesis for underwater scene reconstruction presents unique challenges due to complex light-media interactions. Optical scattering and absorption in water body bring inhomogeneous medium attenuation interference that disrupts conventional volume rendering assumptions of uniform propagation medium. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers real-time rendering capabilities, it struggles with underwater inhomogeneous environments where scattering media introduce artifacts and inconsistent appearance. In this study, we propose a physics-based framework that disentangles object appearance from water medium effects through tailored Gaussian modeling. Our approach introduces appearance embeddings, which are explicit medium representations for backscatter and attenuation, enhancing scene consistency. In addition, we propose a distance-guided optimization strategy that leverages pseudo-depth maps as supervision with depth regularization and scale penalty terms to improve geometric fidelity. By integrating the proposed appearance and medium modeling components via an underwater imaging model, our approach achieves both high-quality novel view synthesis and physically accurate scene restoration. Experiments demonstrate our significant improvements in rendering quality and restoration accuracy over existing methods. The project page is available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL

- **[Occlusion Boundary and Depth: Mutual Enhancement via Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21231)**  `arXiv:2505.21231`  `cs.CV`  
  _Lintao Xu, Yinghao Wang, Chaohui Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Occlusion Boundary Estimation (OBE) identifies boundaries arising from both inter-object occlusions and self-occlusion within individual objects, distinguishing intrinsic object edges from occlusion-induced contours to improve scene understanding and 3D reconstruction capacity. This is closely related to Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE), which infers depth from a single image, as occlusion boundaries provide critical geometric cues for resolving depth ambiguities, while depth priors can conversely refine occlusion reasoning in complex scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel network, MoDOT, that first jointly estimates depth and OBs. We propose CASM, a cross-attention multi-scale strip convolution module, leverages mid-level OB features to significantly enhance depth prediction. Additionally, we introduce an occlusion-aware loss function, OBDCL, which encourages sharper and more accurate depth boundaries. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the mutual benefits of jointly estimating depth and OB, and highlight the effectiveness of our model design. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on both our proposed synthetic datasets and one popular real dataset, NYUD-v2, significantly outperforming multi-task baselines. Besides, without domain adaptation, results on real-world depth transfer are comparable to the competitors, while preserving sharp occlusion boundaries for geometric fidelity. We will release our code, pre-trained models, and datasets to support future research in this direction.

  _Peng Wang, Xiang Liu, Peidong Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Stylizing 3D scenes instantly while maintaining multi-view consistency and faithfully resembling a style image remains a significant challenge. Current state-of-the-art 3D stylization methods typically involve computationally intensive test-time optimization to transfer artistic features into a pretrained 3D representation, often requiring dense posed input images. In contrast, leveraging recent advances in feed-forward reconstruction models, we demonstrate a novel approach to achieve direct 3D stylization in less than a second using unposed sparse-view scene images and an arbitrary style image. To address the inherent decoupling between reconstruction and stylization, we introduce a branched architecture that separates structure modeling and appearance shading, effectively preventing stylistic transfer from distorting the underlying 3D scene structure. Furthermore, we adapt an identity loss to facilitate pre-training our stylization model through the novel view synthesis task. This strategy also allows our model to retain its original reconstruction capabilities while being fine-tuned for stylization. Comprehensive evaluations, using both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality stylized 3D content that achieve a superior blend of style and scene appearance, while also outperforming existing methods in terms of multi-view consistency and efficiency.

  _Jiarui Zhang, Zhihao Li, Chong Wang, Bihan Wen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural fields (NFs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in scene reconstruction, powering various tasks such as novel view synthesis. However, existing NF methods relying on RGB or LiDAR inputs often exhibit severe fragility to adverse weather, particularly when applied in outdoor scenarios like autonomous driving. In contrast, millimeter-wave radar is inherently robust to environmental changes, while unfortunately, its integration with NFs remains largely underexplored. Besides, as outdoor driving scenarios frequently involve moving objects, making spatiotemporal modeling essential for temporally consistent novel view synthesis. To this end, we introduce RF4D, a radar-based neural field framework specifically designed for novel view synthesis in outdoor dynamic scenes. RF4D explicitly incorporates temporal information into its representation, significantly enhancing its capability to model moving objects. We further introduce a feature-level flow module that predicts latent temporal offsets between adjacent frames, enforcing temporal coherence in dynamic scene modeling. Moreover, we propose a radar-specific power rendering formulation closely aligned with radar sensing physics, improving synthesis accuracy and interoperability. Extensive experiments on public radar datasets demonstrate the superior performance of RF4D in terms of radar measurement synthesis quality and occupancy estimation accuracy, achieving especially pronounced improvements in dynamic outdoor scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present HuMoCon, a novel motion-video understanding framework designed for advanced human behavior analysis. The core of our method is a human motion concept discovery framework that efficiently trains multi-modal encoders to extract semantically meaningful and generalizable features. HuMoCon addresses key challenges in motion concept discovery for understanding and reasoning, including the lack of explicit multi-modality feature alignment and the loss of high-frequency information in masked autoencoding frameworks. Our approach integrates a feature alignment strategy that leverages video for contextual understanding and motion for fine-grained interaction modeling, further with a velocity reconstruction mechanism to enhance high-frequency feature expression and mitigate temporal over-smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that HuMoCon enables effective motion concept discovery and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in training large models for human motion understanding. We will open-source the associated code with our paper.

  _Xiangyu Sun, Runnan Chen, Mingming Gong, Dong Xu, Tongliang Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse-view scene reconstruction often faces significant challenges due to the constraints imposed by limited observational data. These limitations result in incomplete information, leading to suboptimal reconstructions using existing methodologies. To address this, we present Intern-GS, a novel approach that effectively leverages rich prior knowledge from vision foundation models to enhance the process of sparse-view Gaussian Splatting, thereby enabling high-quality scene reconstruction. Specifically, Intern-GS utilizes vision foundation models to guide both the initialization and the optimization process of 3D Gaussian splatting, effectively addressing the limitations of sparse inputs. In the initialization process, our method employs DUSt3R to generate a dense and non-redundant gaussian point cloud. This approach significantly alleviates the limitations encountered by traditional structure-from-motion (SfM) methods, which often struggle under sparse-view constraints. During the optimization process, vision foundation models predict depth and appearance for unobserved views, refining the 3D Gaussians to compensate for missing information in unseen regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Intern-GS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality across diverse datasets, including both forward-facing and large-scale scenes, such as LLFF, DTU, and Tanks and Temples.

  Recent advancements in handwritten text recognition (HTR) have enabled the effective conversion of handwritten text to digital formats. However, achieving robust recognition across diverse writing styles remains challenging. Traditional HTR methods lack writer-specific personalization at test time due to limitations in model architecture and training strategies. Existing attempts to bridge this gap, through gradient-based meta-learning, still require labeled examples and suffer from parameter-inefficient fine-tuning, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient framework that formulates personalization as prompt tuning, incorporating an auxiliary image reconstruction task with a self-supervised loss to guide prompt adaptation with unlabeled test-time examples. To ensure self-supervised loss effectively minimizes text recognition error, we leverage meta-learning to learn the optimal initialization of the prompts. As a result, our method allows the model to efficiently capture unique writing styles by updating less than 1% of its parameters and eliminating the need for time-intensive annotation processes. We validate our approach on the RIMES and IAM Handwriting Database benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods while using 20x fewer parameters. We believe this represents a significant advancement in personalized handwritten text recognition, paving the way for more reliable and practical deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

  Reconstructing 3D hand mesh is challenging but an important task for human-computer interaction and AR/VR applications. In particular, RGB and/or depth cameras have been widely used in this task. However, methods using these conventional cameras face challenges in low-light environments and during motion blur. Thus, to address these limitations, event cameras have been attracting attention in recent years for their high dynamic range and high temporal resolution. Despite their advantages, event cameras are sensitive to background noise or camera motion, which has limited existing studies to static backgrounds and fixed cameras. In this study, we propose EventEgoHands, a novel method for event-based 3D hand mesh reconstruction in an egocentric view. Our approach introduces a Hand Segmentation Module that extracts hand regions, effectively mitigating the influence of dynamic background events. We evaluated our approach and demonstrated its effectiveness on the N-HOT3D dataset, improving MPJPE by approximately more than 4.5 cm (43%).

  Existing detectors are often trained on biased datasets, leading to the possibility of overfitting on non-causal image attributes that are spuriously correlated with real/synthetic labels. While these biased features enhance performance on the training data, they result in substantial performance degradation when applied to unbiased datasets. One common solution is to perform dataset alignment through generative reconstruction, matching the semantic content between real and synthetic images. However, we revisit this approach and show that pixel-level alignment alone is insufficient. The reconstructed images still suffer from frequency-level misalignment, which can perpetuate spurious correlations. To illustrate, we observe that reconstruction models tend to restore the high-frequency details lost in real images (possibly due to JPEG compression), inadvertently creating a frequency-level misalignment, where synthetic images appear to have richer high-frequency content than real ones. This misalignment leads to models associating high-frequency features with synthetic labels, further reinforcing biased cues. To resolve this, we propose Dual Data Alignment (DDA), which aligns both the pixel and frequency domains. Moreover, we introduce two new test sets: DDA-COCO, containing DDA-aligned synthetic images for testing detector performance on the most aligned dataset, and EvalGEN, featuring the latest generative models for assessing detectors under new generative architectures such as visual auto-regressive generators. Finally, our extensive evaluations demonstrate that a detector trained exclusively on DDA-aligned MSCOCO could improve across 8 diverse benchmarks by a non-trivial margin, showing a +7.2% on in-the-wild benchmarks, highlighting the improved generalizability of unbiased detectors.

  We completely discard the conventional spatial prior in image representation and introduce a novel discrete visual tokenizer: Self-consistency Tokenizer (Selftok). At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior -- mirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the reverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok fundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key ways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion and AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok tokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture -- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training objectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman equation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports reinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable to that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA tokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality reconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for both visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any text-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual tokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all the existing models by a large margin. Therefore, we believe that Selftok effectively addresses the long-standing challenge that visual tokens cannot support effective RL. When combined with the well-established strengths of RL in LLMs, this brings us one step closer to realizing a truly multimodal LLM. Project Page:this https URL.

  This paper proposes a framework for high-fidelity reconstruction of pelvic structures by integrating medical image segmentation and point cloud upsampling. By point cloud upsampling to learn shape priors from MedShapePelvic without requiring landmarks or PCA, our method functions as an implicit statistical shape model. Evaluations on Pelvic1k show significant improvements in surface quality and anatomical accuracy. This approach is generalizable and applicable to other skeletal regions.

  Recent advancements in generative models have enabled the creation of dynamic 4D content - 3D objects in motion - based on text prompts, which holds potential for applications in virtual worlds, media, and gaming. Existing methods provide control over the appearance of generated content, including the ability to animate 3D objects. However, their ability to generate dynamics is limited to the mesh datasets they were trained on, lacking any growth or structural development capability. In this work, we introduce a training-free method for animating 3D objects by conditioning on textual prompts to guide 4D generation, enabling custom general scenes while maintaining the original object's identity. We first convert a 3D mesh into a static 4D Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that preserves the object's visual attributes. Then, we animate the object using an Image-to-Video diffusion model driven by text. To improve motion realism, we introduce a view-consistent noising protocol that aligns object perspectives with the noising process to promote lifelike movement, and a masked Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss that leverages attention maps to focus optimization on relevant regions, better preserving the original object. We evaluate our model on two different 3D object datasets for temporal coherence, prompt adherence, and visual fidelity, and find that our method outperforms the baseline based on multiview training, achieving better consistency with the textual prompt in hard scenarios.

  Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown encouraging results in dense visual SLAM. However, existing methods produce low-quality scene reconstruction and low-accuracy localization performance when scaling up to large indoor scenes and long sequences. These limitations are mainly due to their single, global radiance field with finite capacity, which does not adapt to large scenarios. Their end-to-end pose networks are also not robust enough with the growth of cumulative errors in large scenes. To this end, we introduce PLGSLAM, a neural visual SLAM system capable of high-fidelity surface reconstruction and robust camera tracking in real-time. To handle large-scale indoor scenes, PLGSLAM proposes a progressive scene representation method which dynamically allocates new local scene representation trained with frames within a local sliding window. This allows us to scale up to larger indoor scenes and improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In local scene representation, PLGSLAM utilizes tri-planes for local high-frequency features with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks for the low-frequency feature, achieving smoothness and scene completion in unobserved areas. Moreover, we propose local-to-global bundle adjustment method with a global keyframe database to address the increased pose drifts on long sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that PLGSLAM achieves state-of-the-art scene reconstruction results and tracking performance across various datasets and scenarios (both in small and large-scale indoor environments). The code is open-sourced atthis https URL.

  A recent study showed that large language models (LLMs) can reconstruct surprisingly long texts - up to thousands of tokens - via autoregressive generation from just one specially trained input embedding. In this work, we explore whether such reconstruction is possible without autoregression. We show that frozen LLMs can generate hundreds of accurate tokens in just one forward pass, when provided with only two learned embeddings. This reveals a surprising and underexplored capability of LLMs - multi-token generation without iterative decoding. We investigate the behaviour of these embeddings and provide insight into the type of information they encode. We also empirically show that although these representations are not unique for a given text, they form connected and local regions in embedding space - a property that suggests the potential of learning a dedicated encoder into that space.

  Knowledge editing methods (KEs) are a cost-effective way to update the factual content of large language models (LLMs), but they pose a dual-use risk. While KEs are beneficial for updating outdated or incorrect information, they can be exploited maliciously to implant misinformation or bias. In order to defend against these types of malicious manipulation, we need robust techniques that can reliably detect, interpret, and mitigate adversarial edits. This work investigates the traceability and reversibility of knowledge edits, focusing on the widely used Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) method. We first show that ROME introduces distinctive distributional patterns in the edited weight matrices, which can serve as effective signals for locating the edited weights. Second, we show that these altered weights can reliably be used to predict the edited factual relation, enabling partial reconstruction of the modified fact. Building on this, we propose a method to infer the edited object entity directly from the modified weights, without access to the editing prompt, achieving over 95% accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that ROME edits can be reversed, recovering the model's original outputs with $\geq$ 80% accuracy. Our findings highlight the feasibility of detecting, tracing, and reversing edits based on the edited weights, offering a robust framework for safeguarding LLMs against adversarial manipulations.

  The brain's intricate connectome, a blueprint for its function, presents immense complexity, yet it arises from a compact genetic code, hinting at underlying low-dimensional organizational principles. This work bridges connectomics and representation learning to uncover these principles. We propose a framework that combines subgraph extraction from the Drosophila connectome, FlyWire, with a generative model to derive interpretable low-dimensional representations of neural circuitry. Crucially, an explainability module links these latent dimensions to specific structural features, offering insights into their functional relevance. We validate our approach by demonstrating effective graph reconstruction and, significantly, the ability to manipulate these latent codes to controllably generate connectome subgraphs with predefined properties. This research offers a novel tool for understanding brain architecture and a potential avenue for designing bio-inspired artificial neural networks.
