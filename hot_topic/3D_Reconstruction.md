- **[Task Reconstruction and Extrapolation for $œÄ_0$ using Text Latent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03500)**  `arXiv:2505.03500`  `cs.RO`  
  _Quanyi Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language-action models (VLAs) often achieve high performance on demonstrated tasks but struggle significantly when required to extrapolate, combining skills learned from different tasks in novel ways. For instance, VLAs might successfully put the cream cheese in the bowl and put the bowl on top of the cabinet, yet still fail to put the cream cheese on top of the cabinet. In this work, we demonstrate that behaviors from distinct tasks can be effectively recombined by manipulating the VLA's internal representations at inference time. Concretely, we identify the text latent by averaging the text tokens' hidden states across all demonstrated trajectories for a specific base task. For executing an extrapolated task, we can temporally interpolate the text latent of the two base tasks and add it back to the text hidden states, so sub-behaviors from the two tasks will be activated sequentially. We evaluate this approach using the newly created libero-ood benchmark, featuring 20 tasks extrapolated from standard LIBERO suites. The results on libero-ood show that all SOTA VLAs achieve < 15% success rate, while $\pi0$ with text latent interpolation reaches an 83% success rate. Further qualitative analysis reveals a tendency for VLAs to exhibit spatial overfitting, mapping object names to demonstrated locations rather than achieving genuine object and goal understanding. Additionally, we find that decoding the text latent yields human-unreadable prompts that can nevertheless instruct the VLA to achieve a 70% success rate on standard LIBERO suites, enabling private instruction or backdoor attacks.

- **[Tailored Architectures for Time Series Forecasting: Evaluating Deep Learning Models on Gaussian Process-Generated Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08977)**  `arXiv:2506.08977`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Victoria Hankemeier, Malte Schilling_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Developments in Deep Learning have significantly improved time series forecasting by enabling more accurate modeling of complex temporal dependencies inherent in sequential data. The effectiveness of such models is often demonstrated on limited sets of specific real-world data. Although this allows for comparative analysis, it still does not demonstrate how specific data characteristics align with the architectural strengths of individual models. Our research aims at uncovering clear connections between time series characteristics and particular models. We introduce a novel dataset generated using Gaussian Processes, specifically designed to display distinct, known characteristics for targeted evaluations of model adaptability to them. Furthermore, we present TimeFlex, a new model that incorporates a modular architecture tailored to handle diverse temporal dynamics, including trends and periodic patterns. This model is compared to current state-of-the-art models, offering a deeper understanding of how models perform under varied time series conditions.

- **[PatchTrAD: A Patch-Based Transformer focusing on Patch-Wise Reconstruction Error for Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08827)**  `arXiv:2504.08827`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Samy-Melwan Vilhes, Gilles Gasso, Mokhtar Z Alaya_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) focuses on identifying whether observations in streaming data deviate significantly from normal patterns. With the prevalence of connected devices, anomaly detection on time series has become paramount, as it enables real-time monitoring and early detection of irregular behaviors across various application domains. In this work, we introduce PatchTrAD, a Patch-based Transformer model for time series anomaly detection. Our approach leverages a Transformer encoder along with the use of patches under a reconstructionbased framework for anomaly detection. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets show that PatchTrAD is on par, in terms of detection performance, with state-of-the-art deep learning models for anomaly detection while being time efficient during inference.

- **[Fusing Cross-modal and Uni-modal Representations: A Kronecker Product Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08645)**  `arXiv:2506.08645`  `cs.LG`  
  _Youqi Wu, Jingwei Zhang, Farzan Farnia_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cross-modal embeddings, such as CLIP, BLIP and their variants, have achieved promising results in aligning representations across modalities. However, these embeddings could underperform compared to state-of-the-art single-modality embeddings on modality-specific tasks. On the other hand, single-modality embeddings excel in their domains but lack cross-modal alignment capabilities. In this work, we focus on the problem of unifying cross-modality and single-modality embeddings to achieve the performance of modality-expert embedding within individual modalities while preserving cross-modal alignment. To this end, we propose RP-KrossFuse, a method that leverages a random projection-based Kronecker product to integrate cross-modal embeddings with single-modality embeddings. RP-KrossFuse aims to fuse the sample-pairwise similarity scores of the fused embeddings and operates efficiently in a specified kernel space and supports scalable implementations via random Fourier features for shift-invariant kernels such as the Gaussian kernel. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RP-KrossFuse through several numerical experiments, combining CLIP embeddings with uni-modal image and text embeddings. Our numerical results indicate that RP-KrossFuse achieves competitive modality-specific performance while retaining cross-modal alignment, bridging the gap between cross-modal and single-modality embeddings.

- **[Gumbel-max List Sampling for Distribution Coupling with Multiple Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05632)**  `arXiv:2506.05632`  `cs.LG`  
  _Joseph Rowan, Buu Phan, Ashish Khisti_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study a relaxation of the problem of coupling probability distributions -- a list of samples is generated from one distribution and an accept is declared if any one of these samples is identical to the sample generated from the other distribution. We propose a novel method for generating samples, which extends the Gumbel-max sampling suggested in Daliri et al. (arXiv:2408.07978) for coupling probability distributions. We also establish a corresponding lower bound on the acceptance probability, which we call the list matching lemma. We next discuss two applications of our setup. First, we develop a new mechanism for multi-draft speculative sampling that is simple to implement and achieves performance competitive with baselines such as SpecTr and SpecInfer across a range of language tasks. Our method also guarantees a certain degree of drafter invariance with respect to the output tokens which is not supported by existing schemes. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the token level acceptance probability. As our second application, we consider distributed lossy compression with side information in a setting where a source sample is compressed and available to multiple decoders, each with independent side information. We propose a compression technique that is based on our generalization of Gumbel-max sampling and show that it provides significant gains in experiments involving synthetic Gaussian sources and the MNIST image dataset.

- **[Equivalence of stochastic and deterministic policy gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23244)**  `arXiv:2505.23244`  `cs.LG`  
  _Emo Todorov_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Policy gradients in continuous control have been derived for both stochastic and deterministic policies. Here we study the relationship between the two. In a widely-used family of MDPs involving Gaussian control noise and quadratic control costs, we show that the stochastic and deterministic policy gradients, natural gradients, and state value functions are identical; while the state-control value functions are different. We then develop a general procedure for constructing an MDP with deterministic policy that is equivalent to a given MDP with stochastic policy. The controls of this new MDP are the sufficient statistics of the stochastic policy in the original MDP. Our results suggest that policy gradient methods can be unified by approximating state value functions rather than state-control value functions.

- **[Understanding High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09198)**  `arXiv:2502.09198`  `cs.LG`  
  _Leonard Papenmeier, Matthias Poloczek, Luigi Nardi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent work reported that simple Bayesian optimization (BO) methods perform well for high-dimensional real-world tasks, seemingly contradicting prior work and tribal knowledge. This paper investigates why. We identify underlying challenges that arise in high-dimensional BO and explain why recent methods succeed. Our empirical analysis shows that vanishing gradients caused by Gaussian process (GP) initialization schemes play a major role in the failures of high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HDBO) and that methods that promote local search behaviors are better suited for the task. We find that maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of GP length scales suffices for state-of-the-art performance. Based on this, we propose a simple variant of MLE called MSR that leverages these findings to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a comprehensive set of real-world applications. We present targeted experiments to illustrate and confirm our findings.

- **[DIME:Diffusion-Based Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02316)**  `arXiv:2502.02316`  `cs.LG`  
  _Onur Celik, Zechu Li, Denis Blessing, Ge Li, Daniel Palenicek, Jan Peters, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt-RL) has become the standard approach to RL due to its beneficial exploration properties. Traditionally, policies are parameterized using Gaussian distributions, which significantly limits their representational capacity. Diffusion-based policies offer a more expressive alternative, yet integrating them into MaxEnt-RL poses challenges-primarily due to the intractability of computing their marginal entropy. To overcome this, we propose Diffusion-Based Maximum Entropy RL (DIME). \emph{DIME} leverages recent advances in approximate inference with diffusion models to derive a lower bound on the maximum entropy objective. Additionally, we propose a policy iteration scheme that provably converges to the optimal diffusion policy. Our method enables the use of expressive diffusion-based policies while retaining the principled exploration benefits of MaxEnt-RL, significantly outperforming other diffusion-based methods on challenging high-dimensional control benchmarks. It is also competitive with state-of-the-art non-diffusion based RL methods while requiring fewer algorithmic design choices and smaller update-to-data ratios, reducing computational complexity.

- **[Pivoting Factorization: A Compact Meta Low-Rank Representation of Sparsity for Efficient Inference in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19090)**  `arXiv:2501.19090`  `cs.LG`  
  _Jialin Zhao, Yingtao Zhang, Carlo Vittorio Cannistraci_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid growth of Large Language Models has driven demand for effective model compression techniques to reduce memory and computation costs. Low-rank pruning has gained attention for its GPU compatibility across all densities. However, low-rank pruning struggles to match the performance of semi-structured pruning, often doubling perplexity at similar densities. In this paper, we propose Pivoting Factorization (PIFA), a novel lossless meta low-rank representation that unsupervisedly learns a compact form of any low-rank representation, effectively eliminating redundant information. PIFA identifies pivot rows (linearly independent rows) and expresses non-pivot rows as linear combinations, achieving 24.2% additional memory savings and 24.6% faster inference over low-rank layers at rank = 50% of dimension. To mitigate the performance degradation caused by low-rank pruning, we introduce a novel, retraining-free reconstruction method that minimizes error accumulation (M). MPIFA, combining M and PIFA into an end-to-end framework, significantly outperforms existing low-rank pruning methods, and achieves performance comparable to semi-structured pruning, while surpassing it in GPU efficiency and compatibility.

- **[Improved Variational Inference in Discrete VAEs using Error Correcting Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07840)**  `arXiv:2410.07840`  `cs.LG`  
  _Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez-Garc√≠a, Grace Villacr√©s, David Mitchell, Pablo M. Olmos_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite advances in deep probabilistic models, learning discrete latent representations remains challenging. This work introduces a novel method to improve inference in discrete Variational Autoencoders by reframing the inference problem through a generative perspective. We conceptualize the model as a communication system, and propose to leverage Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) to introduce redundancy in latent representations, allowing the variational posterior to produce more accurate estimates and reduce the variational gap. We present a proof-of-concept using a Discrete Variational Autoencoder with binary latent variables and low-complexity repetition codes, extending it to a hierarchical structure for disentangling global and local data features. Our approach significantly improves generation quality, data reconstruction, and uncertainty calibration, outperforming the uncoded models even when trained with tighter bounds such as the Importance Weighted Autoencoder objective. We also outline the properties that ECCs should possess to be effectively utilized for improved discrete variational inference.

- **[StreamSplat: Towards Online Dynamic 3D Reconstruction from Uncalibrated Video Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08862)**  `arXiv:2506.08862`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Zike Wu, Qi Yan, Xuanyu Yi, Lele Wang, Renjie Liao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-time reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from uncalibrated video streams is crucial for numerous real-world applications. However, existing methods struggle to jointly address three key challenges: 1) processing uncalibrated inputs in real time, 2) accurately modeling dynamic scene evolution, and 3) maintaining long-term stability and computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering scene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical innovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS position prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic decoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive experiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat consistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic scene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily long video streams. Code and models are available atthis https URL.

- **[UnCLe: Benchmarking Unsupervised Continual Learning for Depth Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18074)**  `arXiv:2410.18074`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Xien Chen, Rit Gangopadhyay, Michael Chu, Patrick Rim, Hyoungseob Park, Alex Wong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose UnCLe, the first standardized benchmark for Unsupervised Continual Learning of a multimodal 3D reconstruction task: Depth completion aims to infer a dense depth map from a pair of synchronized RGB image and sparse depth map. We benchmark depth completion models under the practical scenario of unsupervised learning over continuous streams of data. While unsupervised learning of depth boasts the possibility continual learning of novel data distributions over time, existing methods are typically trained on a static, or stationary, dataset. However, when adapting to novel nonstationary distributions, they ``catastrophically forget'' previously learned information. UnCLe simulates these non-stationary distributions by adapting depth completion models to sequences of datasets containing diverse scenes captured from distinct domains using different visual and range sensors. We adopt representative methods from continual learning paradigms and translate them to enable unsupervised continual learning of depth completion. We benchmark these models across indoor and outdoor environments, and investigate the degree of catastrophic forgetting through standard quantitative metrics. We find that unsupervised continual learning of depth completion is an open problem, and we invite researchers to leverage UnCLe as a development platform.

- **[Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction Helps VLMs Understand Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09040)**  `arXiv:2506.09040`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Dianyi Wang, Wei Song, Yikun Wang, Siyuan Wang, Kaicheng Yu, Zhongyu Wei, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result, current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR), which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Spatial Transcriptomics Expression Prediction from Histopathology Based on Cross-Modal Mask Reconstruction and Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08854)**  `arXiv:2506.08854`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatial transcriptomics is a technology that captures gene expression levels at different spatial locations, widely used in tumor microenvironment analysis and molecular profiling of histopathology, providing valuable insights into resolving gene expression and clinical diagnosis of cancer. Due to the high cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based deep learning method to predict spatially resolved gene expression from whole-slide images. Evaluation across six different disease datasets demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes, highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26% respectively. Further analysis indicates that our method preserves gene-gene correlations and applies to datasets with limited samples. Additionally, our method exhibits potential in cancer tissue localization based on biomarker expression.

- **[TraGraph-GS: Trajectory Graph-based Gaussian Splatting for Arbitrary Large-Scale Scene Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08704)**  `arXiv:2506.08704`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xiaohan Zhang, Sitong Wang, Yushen Yan, Yi Yang, Mingda Xu, Qi Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-quality novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes presents a challenging dilemma in 3D computer vision. Existing methods typically partition large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86 dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a fast and accurate surface reconstruction algorithm for unorganized point clouds using an implicit representation. Recent learning methods are either single-object representations with small neural models that allow for high surface details but require per-object training or generalized representations that require larger models and generalize to newer shapes but lack details, and inference is slow. We propose a new implicit representation for general 3D shapes that is faster than all the baselines at their optimum resolution, with only a marginal loss in performance compared to the state-of-the-art. We achieve the best accuracy-speed trade-off using three key contributions. Many implicit methods extract features from the point cloud to classify whether a query point is inside or outside the object. First, to speed up the reconstruction, we show that this feature extraction does not need to use the query point at an early stage (lazy query). Second, we use a parallel multi-scale grid representation to develop robust features for different noise levels and input resolutions. Finally, we show that attention across scales can provide improved reconstruction results.

  Several variants of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have significantly improved the accuracy of synthesized images and surface reconstruction of 3D scenes/objects. In all of these methods, a key characteristic is that none can train the neural network with every possible input data, specifically, every pixel and potential 3D point along the projection rays due to scalability issues. While vanilla NeRFs uniformly sample both the image pixels and 3D points along the projection rays, some variants focus only on guiding the sampling of the 3D points along the projection rays. In this paper, we leverage the implicit surface representation of the foreground scene and model a probability density function in a 3D image projection space to achieve a more targeted sampling of the rays toward regions of interest, resulting in improved rendering. Additionally, a new surface reconstruction loss is proposed for improved performance. This new loss fully explores the proposed 3D image projection space model and incorporates near-to-surface and empty space components. By integrating our novel sampling strategy and novel loss into current state-of-the-art neural implicit surface renderers, we achieve more accurate and detailed 3D reconstructions and improved image rendering, especially for the regions of interest in any given scene.

- **[GIQ: Benchmarking 3D Geometric Reasoning of Vision Foundation Models with Simulated and Real Polyhedra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08194)**  `arXiv:2506.08194`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Monocular 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive results on standard benchmarks, yet their true understanding of geometric properties remains unclear. We introduce GIQ , a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the geometric reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models. GIQ comprises synthetic and real-world images of 224 diverse polyhedra - including Platonic, Archimedean, Johnson, and Catalan solids, as well as stellations and compound shapes - covering varying levels of complexity and symmetry. Through systematic experiments involving monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry detection, mental rotation tests, and zero-shot shape classification tasks, we reveal significant shortcomings in current models. State-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms trained on extensive 3D datasets struggle to reconstruct even basic geometric forms accurately. While foundation models effectively detect specific 3D symmetry elements via linear probing, they falter significantly in tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation, such as mental rotation. Moreover, advanced vision-language assistants exhibit remarkably low accuracy on complex polyhedra, systematically misinterpreting basic properties like face geometry, convexity, and compound structures. GIQ is publicly available, providing a structured platform to highlight and address critical gaps in geometric intelligence, facilitating future progress in robust, geometry-aware representation learning.

- **[Spectral Domain Neural Reconstruction for Passband FMCW Radars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08163)**  `arXiv:2506.08163`  `cs.CV`  
  _Harshvardhan Takawale, Nirupam Roy_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present SpINRv2, a neural framework for high-fidelity volumetric reconstruction using Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar. Extending our prior work (SpINR), this version introduces enhancements that allow accurate learning under high start frequencies-where phase aliasing and sub-bin ambiguity become prominent. Our core contribution is a fully differentiable frequency-domain forward model that captures the complex radar response using closed-form synthesis, paired with an implicit neural representation (INR) for continuous volumetric scene modeling. Unlike time-domain baselines, SpINRv2 directly supervises the complex frequency spectrum, preserving spectral fidelity while drastically reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce sparsity and smoothness regularization to disambiguate sub-bin ambiguities that arise at fine range resolutions. Experimental results show that SpINRv2 significantly outperforms both classical and learning-based baselines, especially under high-frequency regimes, establishing a new benchmark for neural radar-based 3D imaging.

- **[ZigzagPointMamba: Spatial-Semantic Mamba for Point Cloud Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21381)**  `arXiv:2505.21381`  `cs.CV`  
  _Linshuang Diao, Dayong Ren, Sensen Song, Yurong Qian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State Space models (SSMs) such as PointMamba enable efficient feature extraction for point cloud self-supervised learning with linear complexity, outperforming Transformers in computational efficiency. However, existing PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking, which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens. This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of ScanObjectNN.

  Reconstructing spatially and temporally coherent videos from time-varying measurements is a fundamental challenge in many scientific domains. A major difficulty arises from the sparsity of measurements, which hinders accurate recovery of temporal dynamics. Existing image diffusion-based methods rely on extracting temporal consistency directly from measurements, limiting their effectiveness on scientific tasks with high spatiotemporal uncertainty. We address this difficulty by proposing a plug-and-play framework that incorporates a learned spatiotemporal diffusion prior. Due to its plug-and-play nature, our framework can be flexibly applied to different video inverse problems without the need for task-specific design and temporal heuristics. We further demonstrate that a spatiotemporal diffusion model can be trained efficiently with limited video data. We validate our approach on two challenging scientific video reconstruction tasks: black hole video reconstruction and dynamic MRI. While baseline methods struggle to provide temporally coherent reconstructions, our approach achieves significantly improved recovery of the spatiotemporal structure of the underlying ground truth videos.

  Retrieving images from the same location as a given query is an important component of multiple computer vision tasks, like Visual Place Recognition, Landmark Retrieval, Visual Localization, 3D reconstruction, and SLAM. However, existing solutions are built to specifically work for one of these tasks, and are known to fail when the requirements slightly change or when they meet out-of-distribution data. In this paper we combine a variety of existing methods, training techniques, and datasets to train a retrieval model, called MegaLoc, that is performant on multiple tasks. We find that MegaLoc (1) achieves state of the art on a large number of Visual Place Recognition datasets, (2) impressive results on common Landmark Retrieval datasets, and (3) sets a new state of the art for Visual Localization on the LaMAR datasets, where we only changed the retrieval method to the existing localization pipeline. The code for MegaLoc is available atthis https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Masked autoencoding and generative pretraining have achieved remarkable success in computer vision and natural language processing, and more recently, they have been extended to the point cloud domain. Nevertheless, existing point cloud models suffer from the issue of information leakage due to the pre-sampling of center points, which leads to trivial proxy tasks for the models. These approaches primarily focus on local feature reconstruction, limiting their ability to capture global patterns within point clouds. In this paper, we argue that the reduced difficulty of pretext tasks hampers the model's capacity to learn expressive representations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel solution called the Differentiable Center Sampling Network (DCS-Net). It tackles the information leakage problem by incorporating both global feature reconstruction and local feature reconstruction as non-trivial proxy tasks, enabling simultaneous learning of both the global and local patterns within point cloud. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the expressive capacity of existing point cloud models and effectively addresses the issue of information leakage.

  Traffic Intersections are vital to urban road networks as they regulate the movement of people and goods. However, they are regions of conflicting trajectories and are prone to accidents. Deep Generative models of traffic dynamics at signalized intersections can greatly help traffic authorities better understand the efficiency and safety aspects. At present, models are evaluated on computational metrics that primarily look at trajectory reconstruction errors. They are not evaluated online in a `live' microsimulation scenario. Further, these metrics do not adequately consider traffic engineering-specific concerns such as red-light violations, unallowed stoppage, etc. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analytics tool to train, run, and evaluate models with metrics that give better insights into model performance from a traffic engineering point of view. We train a state-of-the-art multi-vehicle trajectory forecasting model on a large dataset collected by running a calibrated scenario of a real-world urban intersection. We then evaluate the performance of the prediction models, online in a microsimulator, under unseen traffic conditions. We show that despite using ideally-behaved trajectories as input, and achieving low trajectory reconstruction errors, the generated trajectories show behaviors that break traffic rules. We introduce new metrics to evaluate such undesired behaviors and present our results.

  In the architectural design process, floorplan design is often a dynamic and iterative process. Architects progressively draw various parts of the floorplan according to their ideas and requirements, continuously adjusting and refining throughout the design process. Therefore, the ability to predict a complete floorplan from a partial one holds significant value in the design process. Such prediction can help architects quickly generate preliminary designs, improve design efficiency, and reduce the workload associated with repeated modifications. To address this need, we propose FloorplanMAE, a self-supervised learning framework for restoring incomplete floor plans into complete ones. First, we developed a floor plan reconstruction dataset, FloorplanNet, specifically trained on architectural floor plans. Secondly, we propose a floor plan reconstruction method based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which reconstructs missing parts by masking sections of the floor plan and training a lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated the reconstruction accuracy of FloorplanMAE and compared it with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, we validated the model using real sketches from the early stages of architectural design. Experimental results show that the FloorplanMAE model can generate high-quality complete floor plans from incomplete partial plans. This framework provides a scalable solution for floor plan generation, with broad application prospects.
