- **[CLEAR-IR: Clarity-Enhanced Active Reconstruction of Infrared Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04883)**  `arXiv:2510.04883`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  This paper presents a novel approach for enabling robust robotic perception in dark environments using infrared (IR) stream. IR stream is less susceptible to noise than RGB in low-light conditions. However, it is dominated by active emitter patterns that hinder high-level tasks such as object detection, tracking and localisation. To address this, a Deep Multi-scale Aware Overcomplete (DeepMAO) inspired architecture is proposed that reconstructs clean IR images from emitter populated input, improving both image quality and downstream robotic performance. This approach outperforms existing enhancement techniques and enables reliable operation of vision driven robotic systems across illumination conditions from well-lit to extreme low-light scenes. The results outline the ability of this work to be able to mimic RGB styling from the scene and its applicability on robotics tasks that were trained on RGB images, opening the possibility of doing these tasks in extreme low-light without on-board lighting.

  Mobile robots and IoT devices demand real-time localization and dense reconstruction under tight compute and energy budgets. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dense SLAM, dynamic objects and occlusions still degrade tracking and mapping. Existing dynamic 3DGS-SLAM often relies on heavy optical flow and per-frame segmentation, which is costly for mobile deployment and brittle under challenging illumination. We present DAGS-SLAM, a dynamic-aware 3DGS-SLAM system that maintains a spatiotemporal motion probability (MP) state per Gaussian and triggers semantics on demand via an uncertainty-aware scheduler. DAGS-SLAM fuses lightweight YOLO instance priors with geometric cues to estimate and temporally update MP, propagates MP to the front-end for dynamic-aware correspondence selection, and suppresses dynamic artifacts in the back-end via MP-guided optimization. Experiments on public dynamic RGB-D benchmarks show improved reconstruction and robust tracking while sustaining real-time throughput on a commodity GPU, demonstrating a practical speed-accuracy tradeoff with reduced semantic invocations toward mobile deployment.

- **[GRAIL: Post-hoc Compensation by Linear Reconstruction for Compressed Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23795)**  `arXiv:2602.23795`  `cs.LG`  
  _Wenwu Tang, Dong Wang, Lothar Thiele, Olga Saukh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Structured deep model compression methods are hardware-friendly and substantially reduce memory and inference costs. However, under aggressive compression, the resulting accuracy degradation often necessitates post-compression finetuning, which can be impractical due to missing labeled data or high training cost. We propose post-hoc blockwise compensation, called GRAIL, a simple zero-finetuning step applied after model compression that restores each block's input-output behavior using a small calibration set. The method summarizes hidden activations via a Gram matrix and applies ridge regression to linearly reconstruct the original hidden representation from the reduced one. The resulting reconstruction map is absorbed into the downstream projection weights, while the upstream layer is compressed. The approach is selector-agnostic (Magnitude, Wanda, Gram-based selection, or folding), data-aware (requiring only a few forward passes without gradients or labels), and recovers classic pruning or folding when the Gram matrix is near identity, indicating weak inter-channel correlations. Across ResNets, ViTs, and decoder-only LLMs, GRAIL consistently improves accuracy or perplexity over data-free and data-aware pruning or folding baselines in practical compression regimes, with manageable overhead and no backpropagation.

- **[Selective Denoising Diffusion Model for Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23662)**  `arXiv:2602.23662`  `cs.LG`  
  _Kohei Obata, Zheng Chen, Yasuko Matsubara, Lingwei Zhu, Yasushi Sakurai_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) has been an important area of research for decades, with reconstruction-based methods, mostly based on generative models, gaining popularity and demonstrating success. Diffusion models have recently attracted attention due to their advanced generative capabilities. Existing diffusion-based methods for TSAD rely on a conditional strategy, which reconstructs input instances from white noise with the aid of the conditioner. However, this poses challenges in accurately reconstructing the normal parts, resulting in suboptimal detection performance. In response, we propose a novel diffusion-based method, named AnomalyFilter, which acts as a selective filter that only denoises anomaly parts in the instance while retaining normal parts. To build such a filter, we mask Gaussian noise during the training phase and conduct the denoising process without adding noise to the instances. The synergy of the two simple components greatly enhances the performance of naive diffusion models. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that AnomalyFilter achieves notably low reconstruction error on normal parts, providing empirical support for its effectiveness in anomaly detection. AnomalyFilter represents a pioneering approach that focuses on the noise design of diffusion models specifically tailored for TSAD.

- **[Synthesising Counterfactual Explanations via Label-Conditional Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04855)**  `arXiv:2510.04855`  `cs.LG`  
  _Junqi Jiang, Francesco Leofante, Antonio Rago, Francesca Toni_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Counterfactual explanations (CEs) provide recourse recommendations for individuals affected by algorithmic decisions. A key challenge is generating CEs that are robust against various perturbation types (e.g. input and model perturbations) while simultaneously satisfying other desirable properties. These include plausibility, ensuring CEs reside on the data manifold, and diversity, providing multiple distinct recourse options for single inputs. Existing methods, however, mostly struggle to address these multifaceted requirements in a unified, model-agnostic manner. We address these limitations by proposing a novel generative framework. First, we introduce the Label-conditional Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (L-GMVAE), a model trained to learn a structured latent space where each class label is represented by a set of Gaussian components with diverse, prototypical centroids. Building on this, we present LAPACE (LAtent PAth Counterfactual Explanations), a model-agnostic algorithm that synthesises entire paths of CE points by interpolating from inputs' latent representations to those learned latent centroids. This approach inherently ensures robustness to input changes, as all paths for a given target class converge to the same fixed centroids. Furthermore, the generated paths provide a spectrum of recourse options, allowing users to navigate the trade-off between proximity and plausibility while also encouraging robustness against model changes. In addition, user-specified actionability constraints can also be easily incorporated via lightweight gradient optimisation through the L-GMVAE's decoder. Comprehensive experiments show that LAPACE is computationally efficient and achieves competitive performance across eight quantitative metrics.

- **[TimeMAE: Self-Supervised Representations of Time Series with Decoupled Masked Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00320)**  `arXiv:2303.00320`  `cs.LG`  
  _Mingyue Cheng, Xiaoyu Tao, Zhiding Liu, Qi Liu, Hao Zhang, Rujiao Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning transferable representations from unlabeled time series is crucial for improving performance in data-scarce classification. Existing self-supervised methods often operate at the point level and rely on unidirectional encoding, leading to low semantic density and a mismatch between pre-training and downstream optimization. In this paper, we propose TimeMAE, a self-supervised framework that reformulates masked modeling for time series via semantic unit elevation and decoupled representation learning. Instead of modeling individual time steps, TimeMAE segments time series into non-overlapping sub-series to form semantically enriched units, enabling more informative masked reconstruction while reducing computational cost. To address the representation discrepancy introduced by masking, we design a decoupled masked autoencoder that separately encodes visible and masked regions, avoiding artificial masked tokens in the main encoder. To guide pre-training, we introduce two complementary objectives: masked codeword classification, which discretizes sub-series semantics via a learned tokenizer and masked representation regression, which aligns continuous representations through a momentum-updated target encoder. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that TimeMAE outperforms competitive baselines, particularly in label-scarce scenarios and transfer learning scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present SHARP, an approach to photorealistic view synthesis from a single image. Given a single photograph, SHARP regresses the parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation of the depicted scene. This is done in less than a second on a standard GPU via a single feedforward pass through a neural network. The 3D Gaussian representation produced by SHARP can then be rendered in real time, yielding high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views. The representation is metric, with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARP delivers robust zero-shot generalization across datasets. It sets a new state of the art on multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25-34% and DISTS by 21-43% versus the best prior model, while lowering the synthesis time by three orders of magnitude.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Simulation is essential to the development and evaluation of autonomous robots such as self-driving vehicles. Neural reconstruction is emerging as a promising solution as it enables simulating a wide variety of scenarios from real-world data alone in an automated and scalable way. However, while methods such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting can produce visually compelling results, they often exhibit artifacts particularly when rendering novel views, and fail to realistically integrate inserted dynamic objects, especially when they were captured from different scenes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DiffusionHarmonizer, an online generative enhancement framework that transforms renderings from such imperfect scenes into temporally consistent outputs while improving their realism. At its core is a single-step temporally-conditioned enhancer that is converted from a pretrained multi-step image diffusion model, capable of running in online simulators on a single GPU. The key to training it effectively is a custom data curation pipeline that constructs synthetic-real pairs emphasizing appearance harmonization, artifact correction, and lighting realism. The result is a scalable system that significantly elevates simulation fidelity in both research and production environments.

- **[Evidential Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23574)**  `arXiv:2602.23574`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Ruxiao Duan, Alex Wong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding sources of uncertainty is fundamental to trustworthy three-dimensional scene modeling. While recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRFs) achieve impressive accuracy in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, the lack of uncertainty estimation significantly limits their deployment in safety-critical settings. Existing uncertainty quantification methods for NeRFs fail to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Among those that do quantify one or the other, many of them either compromise rendering quality or incur significant computational overhead to obtain uncertainty estimates. To address these issues, we introduce Evidential Neural Radiance Fields, a probabilistic approach that seamlessly integrates with the NeRF rendering process and enables direct quantification of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty from a single forward pass. We compare multiple uncertainty quantification methods on three standardized benchmarks, where our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art scene reconstruction fidelity and uncertainty estimation quality.

- **[SceneTok: A Compressed, Diffusable Token Space for 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18882)**  `arXiv:2602.18882`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Mohammad Asim, Christopher Wewer, Jan Eric Lenssen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present SceneTok, a novel tokenizer for encoding view sets of scenes into a compressed and diffusable set of unstructured tokens. Existing approaches for 3D scene representation and generation commonly use 3D data structures or view-aligned fields. In contrast, we introduce the first method that encodes scene information into a small set of permutation-invariant tokens that is disentangled from the spatial grid. The scene tokens are predicted by a multi-view tokenizer given many context views and rendered into novel views by employing a light-weight rectified flow decoder. We show that the compression is 1-3 orders of magnitude stronger than for other representations while still reaching state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Further, our representation can be rendered from novel trajectories, including ones deviating from the input trajectory, and we show that the decoder gracefully handles uncertainty. Finally, the highly-compressed set of unstructured latent scene tokens enables simple and efficient scene generation in 5 seconds, achieving a much better quality-speed trade-off than previous paradigms.

- **[Quant Experts: Token-aware Adaptive Error Reconstruction with Mixture of Experts for Large Vision-Language Models Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24059)**  `arXiv:2602.24059`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Chenwei Jia, Baoting Li, Xuchong Zhang, Mingzhuo Wei, Bochen Lin, Hongbin Sun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective technique for alleviating the substantial computational and memory overheads of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by compressing both weights and activations without retraining the full model. Existing PTQ methods primarily rely on static identification and global compensation of sensitive or outlier channels, yet they often overlook the distributional differences of these important channels across inputs, leading to unsatisfactory quantization. In this work, we observe that the distributions and occurrence frequencies of important channels vary significantly both across modalities and among tokens, even within the same modality. Accordingly, we propose \textbf{Quant Experts (QE)}, a token-aware adaptive error compensation with mixture-of-experts for VLMs quantization. QE divides the important channels into token-independent and token-dependent groups. For the former, a shared expert is designed for most tokens to compensate for global quantization error using a low-rank adapter. For the latter, routed experts including multiple routed low-rank adapters are elaborated to compensate for local quantization error related to specific tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QE consistently enhances task accuracy across various quantization settings and model scales, ranging from 2B to 70B parameters, while maintaining performance comparable to full-precision models.

- **[ProtoDCS: Towards Robust and Efficient Open-Set Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23653)**  `arXiv:2602.23653`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Wei Luo, Yangfan Ou, Jin Deng, Zeshuai Deng, Xiquan Yan, Zhiquan Wen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot recognition, yet their real-world deployment is challenged by distribution shifts. While Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) can mitigate this, existing VLM-based TTA methods operate under a closed-set assumption, failing in open-set scenarios where test streams contain both covariate-shifted in-distribution (csID) and out-of-distribution (csOOD) data. This leads to a critical difficulty: the model must discriminate unknown csOOD samples to avoid interference while simultaneously adapting to known csID classes for accuracy. Current open-set TTA (OSTTA) methods rely on hard thresholds for separation and entropy minimization for adaptation. These strategies are brittle, often misclassifying ambiguous csOOD samples and inducing overconfident predictions, and their parameter-update mechanism is computationally prohibitive for VLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Double-Check Separation (ProtoDCS), a robust framework for OSTTA that effectively separates csID and csOOD samples, enabling safe and efficient adaptation of VLMs to csID data. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel double-check separation mechanism employing probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) verification to replace brittle thresholding; and (2) an evidence-driven adaptation strategy utilizing uncertainty-aware loss and efficient prototype-level updates, mitigating overconfidence and reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100-C and Tiny-ImageNet-C demonstrate that ProtoDCS achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly boosting both known-class accuracy and OOD detection metrics.

- **[SemVideo: Reconstructs What You Watch from Brain Activity via Hierarchical Semantic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21819)**  `arXiv:2602.21819`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Minghan Yang, Lan Yang, Ke Li, Honggang Zhang, Kaiyue Pang, Yizhe Song_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing dynamic visual experiences from brain activity provides a compelling avenue for exploring the neural mechanisms of human visual perception. While recent progress in fMRI-based image reconstruction has been notable, extending this success to video reconstruction remains a significant challenge. Current fMRI-to-video reconstruction approaches consistently encounter two major shortcomings: (i) inconsistent visual representations of salient objects across frames, leading to appearance mismatches; (ii) poor temporal coherence, resulting in motion misalignment or abrupt frame transitions. To address these limitations, we introduce SemVideo, a novel fMRI-to-video reconstruction framework guided by hierarchical semantic information. At the core of SemVideo is SemMiner, a hierarchical guidance module that constructs three levels of semantic cues from the original video stimulus: static anchor descriptions, motion-oriented narratives, and holistic summaries. Leveraging this semantic guidance, SemVideo comprises three key components: a Semantic Alignment Decoder that aligns fMRI signals with CLIP-style embeddings derived from SemMiner, a Motion Adaptation Decoder that reconstructs dynamic motion patterns using a novel tripartite attention fusion architecture, and a Conditional Video Render that leverages hierarchical semantic guidance for video reconstruction. Experiments conducted on the CC2017 and HCP datasets demonstrate that SemVideo achieves superior performance in both semantic alignment and temporal consistency, setting a new state-of-the-art in fMRI-to-video reconstruction.

- **[MEGS$^{2}$: Memory-Efficient Gaussian Splatting via Spherical Gaussians and Unified Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07021)**  `arXiv:2509.07021`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Jiarui Chen, Yikeng Chen, Yingshuang Zou, Ye Huang, Peng Wang, Yuan Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical harmonics with lightweight, arbitrarily oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a 50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

- **[UFO-4D: Unposed Feedforward 4D Reconstruction from Two Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24290)**  `arXiv:2602.24290`  `cs.CV`  
  _Junhwa Hur, Charles Herrmann, Songyou Peng, Philipp Henzler, Zeyu Ma, Todd Zickler, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dense 4D reconstruction from unposed images remains a critical challenge, with current methods relying on slow test-time optimization or fragmented, task-specific feedforward models. We introduce UFO-4D, a unified feedforward framework to reconstruct a dense, explicit 4D representation from just a pair of unposed images. UFO-4D directly estimates dynamic 3D Gaussian Splats, enabling the joint and consistent estimation of 3D geometry, 3D motion, and camera pose in a feedforward manner. Our core insight is that differentiably rendering multiple signals from a single Dynamic 3D Gaussian representation offers major training advantages. This approach enables a self-supervised image synthesis loss while tightly coupling appearance, depth, and motion. Since all modalities share the same geometric primitives, supervising one inherently regularizes and improves the others. This synergy overcomes data scarcity, allowing UFO-4D to outperform prior work by up to 3 times in joint geometry, motion, and camera pose estimation. Our representation also enables high-fidelity 4D interpolation across novel views and time. Please visit our project page for visual results:this https URL

- **[HumanOrbit: 3D Human Reconstruction as 360° Orbit Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24148)**  `arXiv:2602.24148`  `cs.CV`  
  _Keito Suzuki, Kunyao Chen, Lei Wang, Bang Du, Runfa Blark Li, Peng Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a method for generating a full 360° orbit video around a person from a single input image. Existing methods typically adapt image-based diffusion models for multi-view synthesis, but yield inconsistent results across views and with the original identity. In contrast, recent video diffusion models have demonstrated their ability in generating photorealistic results that align well with the given prompts. Inspired by these results, we propose HumanOrbit, a video diffusion model for multi-view human image generation. Our approach enables the model to synthesize continuous camera rotations around the subject, producing geometrically consistent novel views while preserving the appearance and identity of the person. Using the generated multi-view frames, we further propose a reconstruction pipeline that recovers a textured mesh of the subject. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of HumanOrbit for multi-view image generation and that the reconstructed 3D models exhibit superior completeness and fidelity compared to those from state-of-the-art baselines.

- **[Prune Wisely, Reconstruct Sharply: Compact 3D Gaussian Splatting via Adaptive Pruning and Difference-of-Gaussian Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24136)**  `arXiv:2602.24136`  `cs.CV`  
  _Haoran Wang, Guoxi Huang, Fan Zhang, David Bull, Nantheera Anantrasirichai_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent significant advances in 3D scene representation have been driven by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which has enabled real-time rendering with photorealistic quality. 3DGS often requires a large number of primitives to achieve high fidelity, leading to redundant representations and high resource consumption, thereby limiting its scalability for complex or large-scale scenes. Consequently, effective pruning strategies and more expressive primitives that can reduce redundancy while preserving visual quality are crucial for practical deployment. We propose an efficient, integrated reconstruction-aware pruning strategy that adaptively determines pruning timing and refining intervals based on reconstruction quality, thus reducing model size while enhancing rendering quality. Moreover, we introduce a 3D Difference-of-Gaussians primitive that jointly models both positive and negative densities in a single primitive, improving the expressiveness of Gaussians under compact configurations. Our method significantly improves model compactness, achieving up to 90\% reduction in Gaussian-count while delivering visual quality that is similar to, or in some cases better than, that produced by state-of-the-art methods. Code will be made publicly available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in neural surface reconstruction have significantly enhanced 3D reconstruction. However, current real world datasets mainly focus on benchmarking multiview stereo (MVS) based on RGB inputs. Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) and multiview shape from polarization (MVSfP), though indispensable on high-fidelity surface reconstruction and sparse inputs, have not been quantitatively assessed together with MVS. To determine the working range of different MVX (MVS, MVSfP, and MVPS) techniques, we propose EvalMVX, a real-world dataset containing $25$ objects, each captured with a polarized camera under $20$ varying views and $17$ light conditions including OLAT and natural illumination, leading to $8,500$ images. Each object includes aligned ground-truth 3D mesh, facilitating quantitative benchmarking of MVX methods simultaneously. Based on our EvalMVX, we evaluate $13$ MVX methods published in recent years, record the best-performing methods, and identify open problems under diverse geometric details and reflectance types. We hope EvalMVX and the benchmarking results can inspire future research on multiview 3D reconstruction.

- **[Thinking with Images as Continuous Actions: Numerical Visual Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23959)**  `arXiv:2602.23959`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kesen Zhao, Beier Zhu, Junbao Zhou, Xingyu Zhu, Zhongqi Yue, Hanwang Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) increasingly rely on visual chain-of-thought to perform region-grounded reasoning over images. However, existing approaches ground regions via either textified coordinates-causing modality mismatch and semantic fragmentation or fixed-granularity patches that both limit precise region selection and often require non-trivial architectural changes. In this paper, we propose Numerical Visual Chain-of-Thought (NV-CoT), a framework that enables MLLMs to reason over images using continuous numerical coordinates. NV-CoT expands the MLLM action space from discrete vocabulary tokens to a continuous Euclidean space, allowing models to directly generate bounding-box coordinates as actions with only minimal architectural modification. The framework supports both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. In particular, we replace categorical token policies with a Gaussian (or Laplace) policy over coordinates and introduce stochasticity via reparameterized sampling, making NV-CoT fully compatible with GRPO-style policy optimization. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks against eight representative visual reasoning baselines demonstrate that NV-CoT significantly improves localization precision and final answer accuracy, while also accelerating training convergence, validating the effectiveness of continuous-action visual reasoning in MLLMs. The code is available inthis https URL.

  _Xiaozhen Qiao, Wenjia Wang, Zhiyuan Zhao, Jiacheng Sun, Ping Luo, Hongyuan Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing 3D humans from images captured at multiple perspectives typically requires pre-calibration, like using checkerboards or MVS algorithms, which limits scalability and applicability in diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we present \textbf{AHAP} (Reconstructing \textbf{A}rbitrary \textbf{H}umans from \textbf{A}rbitrary \textbf{P}erspectives), a feed-forward framework for reconstructing arbitrary humans from arbitrary camera perspectives without requiring camera calibration. Our core lies in the effective fusion of multi-view geometry to assist human association, reconstruction and localization. Specifically, we use a Cross-View Identity Association module through learnable person queries and soft assignment, supervised by contrastive learning to resolve cross-view human identity association. A Human Head fuses cross-view features and scene context for SMPL prediction, guided by cross-view reprojection losses to enforce body pose consistency. Additionally, multi-view geometry eliminates the depth ambiguity inherent in monocular methods, providing more precise 3D human localization through multi-view triangulation. Experiments on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D demonstrate that AHAP achieves competitive performance on both world-space human reconstruction and camera pose estimation, while being 180$\times$ faster than optimization-based approaches.

- **[Leveraging Geometric Prior Uncertainty and Complementary Constraints for High-Fidelity Neural Indoor Surface Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23926)**  `arXiv:2602.23926`  `cs.CV`  
  _Qiyu Feng, Jiwei Shan, Shing Shin Cheng, Hesheng Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural implicit surface reconstruction with signed distance function has made significant progress, but recovering fine details such as thin structures and complex geometries remains challenging due to unreliable or noisy geometric priors. Existing approaches rely on implicit uncertainty that arises during optimization to filter these priors, which is indirect and inefficient, and masking supervision in high-uncertainty regions further leads to under-constrained optimization. To address these issues, we propose GPU-SDF, a neural implicit framework for indoor surface reconstruction that leverages geometric prior uncertainty and complementary constraints. We introduce a self-supervised module that explicitly estimates prior uncertainty without auxiliary networks. Based on this estimation, we design an uncertainty-guided loss that modulates prior influence rather than discarding it, thereby retaining weak but informative cues. To address regions with high prior uncertainty, GPU-SDF further incorporates two complementary constraints: an edge distance field that strengthens boundary supervision and a multi-view consistency regularization that enforces geometric coherence. Extensive experiments confirm that GPU-SDF improves the reconstruction of fine details and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement for existing frameworks.

  _Xiaojing Zhao, Shiyang Li, Zena Chu, Ying Zhang, Peinan Hao, Tianzi Yan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid advancement of deep learning, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has become a key modality for ship detection. However, robust performance remains challenging in complex scenes, where clutter and speckle noise can induce false alarms and small targets are easily missed. To address these issues, we propose CPN-YOLO, a high-precision ship detection framework built upon YOLOv8 with three targeted improvements. First, we introduce a learnable large-kernel denoising module for input pre-processing, producing cleaner representations and more discriminative features across diverse ship types. Second, we design a feature extraction enhancement strategy based on the PPA attention mechanism to strengthen multi-scale modeling and improve sensitivity to small ships. Third, we incorporate a Gaussian similarity loss derived from the normalized Wasserstein distance (NWD) to better measure similarity under complex bounding-box distributions and improve generalization. Extensive experiments on HRSID and SSDD demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

  Diffusion models are able to produce AI-generated images that are almost indistinguishable from real ones. This raises concerns about their potential misuse and poses substantial challenges for detecting them. Many existing detectors rely on reconstruction error -- the difference between the input image and its reconstructed version -- as the basis for distinguishing real from fake images. However, these detectors become less effective as modern AI-generated images become increasingly similar to real ones. To address this challenge, we propose a novel difference-in-difference method. Instead of directly using the reconstruction error (a first-order difference), we compute the difference in reconstruction error -- a second-order difference -- for variance reduction and improving detection accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong generalization performance, enabling reliable detection of AI-generated images in the era of generative AI.

  We introduce BuildAnyPoint, a novel generative framework for structured 3D building reconstruction from point clouds with diverse distributions, such as those captured by airborne LiDAR and Structure-from-Motion. To recover artist-created building abstraction in this highly underconstrained setting, we capitalize on the role of explicit 3D generative priors in autoregressive mesh generation. Specifically, we design a Loosely Cascaded Diffusion Transformer (Loca-DiT) that initially recovers the underlying distribution from noisy or sparse points, followed by autoregressively encapsulating them into compact meshes. We first formulate distribution recovery as a conditional generation task by training latent diffusion models conditioned on input point clouds, and then tailor a decoder-only transformer for conditional autoregressive mesh generation based on the recovered point clouds. Our method delivers substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements over prior building abstraction methods. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our approach is evidenced by the strong performance of its recovered point clouds on building point cloud completion benchmarks, which exhibit improved surface accuracy and distribution uniformity.

  We present the first study of cross-sensor view synthesis across different modalities. We examine a practical, fundamental, yet widely overlooked problem: getting aligned RGB-X data, where most RGB-X prior work assumes such pairs exist and focuses on modality fusion, but it empirically requires huge engineering effort in calibration. We propose a match-densify-consolidate method. First, we perform RGB-X image matching followed by guided point densification. Using the proposed confidence-aware densification and self-matching filtering, we attain better view synthesis and later consolidate them in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method uses no 3D priors for X-sensor and only assumes nearly no-cost COLMAP for RGB. We aim to remove the cumbersome calibration for various RGB-X sensors and advance the popularity of cross-sensor learning by a scalable solution that breaks through the bottleneck in large-scale real-world RGB-X data collection.

  Prior dual-stream methods with the feature interaction mechanism have achieved remarkable performance in single image reflection removal (SIRR). However, they often struggle with (1) semantic understanding gap between the features of pre-trained models and those of reflection removal models, and (2) reflection label inconsistencies between synthetic and real-world training data. In this work, we first adopt the parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy by integrating several learnable Mona layers into the pre-trained model to align the training directions. Then, a label generator is designed to unify the reflection labels for both synthetic and real-world data. In addition, a Gaussian-based Adaptive Frequency Learning Block (G-AFLB) is proposed to adaptively learn and fuse the frequency priors, and a Dynamic Agent Attention (DAA) is employed as an alternative to window-based attention by dynamically modeling the significance levels across windows (inter-) and within an individual window (intra-). These components constitute our proposed Gap-Free Reflection Removal Network (GFRRN). Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our GFRRN, achieving superior performance against state-of-the-art SIRR methods.

  The proliferation of AI-generated imagery poses escalating challenges for multimedia forensics, yet many existing detectors depend on assumptions about the internals of specific generative models, limiting their cross-model applicability. We introduce a self-supervised approach for detecting AI-generated images that leverages camera metadata -- specifically exchangeable image file format (EXIF) tags -- to learn features intrinsic to digital photography. Our pretext task trains a feature extractor solely on camera-captured photographs by classifying categorical EXIF tags (\emph{e.g.}, camera model and scene type) and pairwise-ranking ordinal and continuous EXIF tags (\emph{e.g.}, focal length and aperture value). Using these EXIF-induced features, we first perform one-class detection by modeling the distribution of photographic images with a Gaussian mixture model and flagging low-likelihood samples as AI-generated. We then extend to binary detection that treats the learned extractor as a strong regularizer for a classifier of the same architecture, operating on high-frequency residuals from spatially scrambled patches. Extensive experiments across various generative models demonstrate that our EXIF-induced detectors substantially advance the state of the art, delivering strong generalization to in-the-wild samples and robustness to common benign image perturbations.

  Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction and 4D human animation have broadened adoption, but integrating the two remains difficult. Key challenges include placing humans at plausible locations and scales without interpenetration, aligning lighting and style between humans and background, and handling dynamic camera trajectories. We introduce AnimateScene, a unified framework addressing these issues. First, an accurate placement module automatically determines realistic 3D positions and prevents collisions during motion. Second, we propose a training-free style alignment method that adapts the 4D human to match background illumination and appearance, achieving coherent composites. Finally, we design a joint post-reconstruction approach that incorporates camera trajectories for smooth, visually engaging motion videos. Experiments across diverse scenes and actions demonstrate that AnimateScene generates dynamic results with high geometric detail and strong spatiotemporal coherence.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present SleepLM, a family of sleep-language foundation models that enable human sleep alignment, interpretation, and interaction with natural language. Despite the critical role of sleep, learning-based sleep analysis systems operate in closed label spaces (e.g., predefined stages or events) and fail to describe, query, or generalize to novel sleep phenomena. SleepLM bridges natural language and multimodal polysomnography, enabling language-grounded representations of sleep physiology. To support this alignment, we introduce a multilevel sleep caption generation pipeline that enables the curation of the first large-scale sleep-text dataset, comprising over 100K hours of data from more than 10,000 individuals. Furthermore, we present a unified pretraining objective that combines contrastive alignment, caption generation, and signal reconstruction to better capture physiological fidelity and cross-modal interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world sleep understanding tasks verify that SleepLM outperforms state-of-the-art in zero-shot and few-shot learning, cross-modal retrieval, and sleep captioning. Importantly, SleepLM also exhibits intriguing capabilities including language-guided event localization, targeted insight generation, and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks. All code and data will be open-sourced.
