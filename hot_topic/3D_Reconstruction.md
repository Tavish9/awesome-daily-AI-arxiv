- **[Tendon-Based Proprioception in an Anthropomorphic Underactuated Robotic Hand with Series Elastic Actuators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12969)**  `arXiv:2509.12969`  `cs.RO`  
  _Jae-Hyun Lee, Jonghoo Park, Kyu-Jin Cho_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anthropomorphic underactuated hands are widely employed for their versatility and structural simplicity. In such systems, compact sensing integration and proper interpretation aligned with underactuation are crucial for realizing practical grasp functionalities. This study proposes an anthropomorphic underactuated hand that achieves comprehensive situational awareness of hand-object interaction, utilizing tendon-based proprioception provided by series elastic actuators (SEAs). We developed a compact SEA with high accuracy and reliability that can be seamlessly integrated into sensorless fingers. By coupling proprioceptive sensing with potential energy-based modeling, the system estimates key grasp-related variables, including contact timing, joint angles, relative object stiffness, and finger configuration changes indicating external disturbances. These estimated variables enable grasp posture reconstruction, safe handling of deformable objects, and blind grasping with proprioceptive-only recognition of objects with varying geometry and stiffness. Finger-level experiments and hand-level demonstrations confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that tendon-based proprioception serves as a compact and robust sensing modality for practical manipulation without reliance on vision or tactile feedback.

  _Hongrui Zhao, Xunlan Zhou, Boris Ivanovic, Negar Mehr_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-robot mapping with neural implicit representations enables the compact reconstruction of complex environments. However, it demands robustness against communication challenges like packet loss and limited bandwidth. While prior works have introduced various mechanisms to mitigate communication disruptions, performance degradation still occurs under extremely low communication success rates. This paper presents UDON, a real-time multi-agent neural implicit mapping framework that introduces a novel uncertainty-weighted distributed optimization to achieve high-quality mapping under severe communication deterioration. The uncertainty weighting prioritizes more reliable portions of the map, while the distributed optimization isolates and penalizes mapping disagreement between individual pairs of communicating agents. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets and real-world robot hardware. We demonstrate that UDON significantly outperforms existing baselines, maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions and consistent scene representations even under extreme communication degradation (as low as 1% success rate).

- **[Data-Driven Discovery of Emergent Dynamics in Reaction-Diffusion Systems from Sparse and Noisy Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09278)**  `arXiv:2509.09278`  `cs.LG` `cs.MA`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity, particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology, epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics. A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models, such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data. This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.

- **[Leveraging Intermediate Representations of Time Series Foundation Models for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12650)**  `arXiv:2509.12650`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Chan Sik Han, Keon Myung Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However, existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations. Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and foundation model-based methods.

- **[Deriving the Scaled-Dot-Function via Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Maximum Entropy Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12285)**  `arXiv:2509.12285`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Jiyong Ma_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present a maximum likelihood estimation approach to determine the value vector in transformer models. We model the sequence of value vectors, key vectors, and the query vector as a sequence of Gaussian distributions. The variance in each Gaussian distribution depends on the time step, the corresponding key vector, and the query vector. The mean value in each Gaussian distribution depends on the time step, and the corresponding value vector. This analysis may offer a new explanation of the scaled-dot-product function or softmax function used in transformer architectures [1]. Another explanation, inspired by [4], is based on the maximum entropy approach in natural language processing [5]. In this approach, a query vector and key vectors are used to derive the feature functions for the maximum entropy model.

- **[Ensemble Visualization With Variational Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13000)**  `arXiv:2509.13000`  `cs.LG`  
  _Cenyang Wu, Qinhan Yu, Liang Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a new method to visualize data ensembles by constructing structured probabilistic representations in latent spaces, i.e., lower-dimensional representations of spatial data features. Our approach transforms the spatial features of an ensemble into a latent space through feature space conversion and unsupervised learning using a variational autoencoder (VAE). The resulting latent spaces follow multivariate standard Gaussian distributions, enabling analytical computation of confidence intervals and density estimation of the probabilistic distribution that generates the data ensemble. Preliminary results on a weather forecasting ensemble demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method.

- **[FEDONet : Fourier-Embedded DeepONet for Spectrally Accurate Operator Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12344)**  `arXiv:2509.12344`  `cs.LG`  
  _Arth Sojitra, Mrigank Dhingra, Omer San_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven frameworks for learning nonlinear operators, particularly suited for approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their promising capabilities, the standard implementation of DeepONets, which typically employs fully connected linear layers in the trunk network, can encounter limitations in capturing complex spatial structures inherent to various PDEs. To address this, we introduce Fourier-embedded trunk networks within the DeepONet architecture, leveraging random Fourier feature mappings to enrich spatial representation capabilities. Our proposed Fourier-embedded DeepONet, FEDONet demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional DeepONet across a comprehensive suite of PDE-driven datasets, including the two-dimensional Poisson equation, Burgers' equation, the Lorenz-63 chaotic system, Eikonal equation, Allen-Cahn equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the Lorenz-96 system. Empirical evaluations of FEDONet consistently show significant improvements in solution reconstruction accuracy, with average relative L2 performance gains ranging between 2-3x compared to the DeepONet baseline. This study highlights the effectiveness of Fourier embeddings in enhancing neural operator learning, offering a robust and broadly applicable methodology for PDE surrogate modeling.

- **[TripOptimizer: Generative 3D Shape Optimization and Drag Prediction using Triplane VAE Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12224)**  `arXiv:2509.12224`  `cs.LG`  
  _Parsa Vatani, Mohamed Elrefaie, Farhad Nazarpour, Faez Ahmed_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The computational cost of traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics-based Aerodynamic Shape Optimization severely restricts design space exploration. This paper introduces TripOptimizer, a fully differentiable deep learning framework for rapid aerodynamic analysis and shape optimization directly from vehicle point cloud data. TripOptimizer employs a Variational Autoencoder featuring a triplane-based implicit neural representation for high-fidelity 3D geometry reconstruction and a drag coefficient prediction head. Trained on DrivAerNet++, a large-scale dataset of 8,000 unique vehicle geometries with corresponding drag coefficients computed via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, the model learns a latent representation that encodes aerodynamically salient geometric features. We propose an optimization strategy that modifies a subset of the encoder parameters to steer an initial geometry towards a target drag value, and demonstrate its efficacy in case studies where optimized designs achieved drag coefficient reductions up to 11.8\%. These results were subsequently validated by using independent, high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations with more than 150 million cells. A key advantage of the implicit representation is its inherent robustness to geometric imperfections, enabling optimization of non-watertight meshes, a significant challenge for traditional adjoint-based methods. The framework enables a more agile Aerodynamic Shape Optimization workflow, reducing reliance on computationally intensive CFD simulations, especially during early design stages.

- **[Improving Accuracy and Efficiency of Implicit Neural Representations: Making SIREN a WINNER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12980)**  `arXiv:2509.12980`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Hemanth Chandravamsi, Dhanush V. Shenoy, Steven H. Frankel_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep neural network training. For code and data visitthis http URL.

- **[Uncertainty-Aware Hourly Air Temperature Mapping at 2 km Resolution via Physics-Guided Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12329)**  `arXiv:2509.12329`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Shengjie Kris Liu, Siqin Wang, Lu Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability. The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction, and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution.

- **[Disentangling Content from Style to Overcome Shortcut Learning: A Hybrid Generative-Discriminative Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11598)**  `arXiv:2509.11598`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Siming Fu, Sijun Dong, Xiaoliang Meng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the remarkable success of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), its generalization is fundamentally hindered by Shortcut Learning, where models exploit superficial features like texture instead of intrinsic structure. We experimentally verify this flaw within the generative paradigm (e.g., MAE) and argue it is a systemic issue also affecting discriminative methods, identifying it as the root cause of their failure on unseen domains. While existing methods often tackle this at a surface level by aligning or separating domain-specific features, they fail to alter the underlying learning mechanism that fosters shortcutthis http URLaddress this at its core, we propose HyGDL (Hybrid Generative-Discriminative Learning Framework), a hybrid framework that achieves explicit content-style disentanglement. Our approach is guided by the Invariance Pre-training Principle: forcing a model to learn an invariant essence by systematically varying a bias (e.g., style) at the input while keeping the supervision signal constant. HyGDL operates on a single encoder and analytically defines style as the component of a representation that is orthogonal to its style-invariant content, derived via vector projection. This is operationalized through a synergistic design: (1) a self-distillation objective learns a stable, style-invariant content direction; (2) an analytical projection then decomposes the representation into orthogonal content and style vectors; and (3) a style-conditioned reconstruction objective uses these vectors to restore the image, providing end-to-end supervision. Unlike prior methods that rely on implicit heuristics, this principled disentanglement allows HyGDL to learn truly robust representations, demonstrating superior performance on benchmarks designed to diagnose shortcut learning.

- **[Runge-Kutta Approximation and Decoupled Attention for Rectified Flow Inversion and Semantic Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12888)**  `arXiv:2509.12888`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Weiming Chen, Zhihan Zhu, Yijia Wang, Zhihai He_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability. Code is available atthis https URL.

  _Irene Iele, Francesco Di Feola, Valerio Guarrasi, Paolo Soda_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion. However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples, demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios.

  _Jiajun Cao, Qizhe Zhang, Peidong Jia, Xuhui Zhao, Bo Lan, Xiaoan Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes open-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.

  _Fei Wang, Xuecheng Wu, Zheng Zhang, Danlei Huang, Yuheng Huang, BoWang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements, diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically, End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset will be released soon.

- **[MSDNet: Efficient 4D Radar Super-Resolution via Multi-Stage Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13149)**  `arXiv:2509.13149`  `cs.CV`  
  _Minqing Huang, Shouyi Lu, Boyuan Zheng, Ziyao Li, Xiao Tang, Guirong Zhuo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling, resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

- **[Dream3DAvatar: Text-Controlled 3D Avatar Reconstruction from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13013)**  `arXiv:2509.13013`  `cs.CV`  
  _Gaofeng Liu, Hengsen Li, Ruoyu Gao, Xuetong Li, Zhiyuan Ma, Tao Fang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input, making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS) from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready 3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

  _Xiao Tang, Guirong Zhuo, Cong Wang, Boyuan Zheng, Minqing Huang, Lianqing Zheng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a 4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale, generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations. Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

- **[AREPAS: Anomaly Detection in Fine-Grained Anatomy with Reconstruction-Based Semantic Patch-Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12905)**  `arXiv:2509.12905`  `cs.CV`  
  _Branko Mitic, Philipp Seeb√∂ck, Helmut Prosch, Georg Langs_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment, differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

- **[MSGFusion: Multimodal Scene Graph-Guided Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12901)**  `arXiv:2509.12901`  `cs.CV`  
  _Guihui Li, Bowei Dong, Kaizhi Dong, Jiayi Li, Haiyong Zheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast, and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images. Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities, attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities, attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection, semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

  _Shreyas Shivakumara, Gabriel Eilertsen, Karljohan Lundin Palmerius_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however, remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

  _Yican Zhao, Ce Wang, You Hao, Lei Li, Tianli Liao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical image segmentation grapples with challenges including multi-scale lesion variability, ill-defined tissue boundaries, and computationally intensive processing demands. This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module (DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

  True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc. However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field. Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality and TDOM geometric accuracy.

  This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8 ``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks based on the ConvNeXt architecture.For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered ``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or $l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned filters.Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting (GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency, achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

  Accurate, high-throughput phenotyping is a critical component of modern crop breeding programs, especially for improving traits such as mechanical stability, biomass production, and disease resistance. Stalk diameter is a key structural trait, but traditional measurement methods are labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsuitable for scalable phenotyping. In this paper, we present a geometry-aware computer vision pipeline for estimating stalk diameter from RGB-D imagery. Our method integrates deep learning-based instance segmentation, 3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and agronomic research.

  Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However, there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers, coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

  Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January 2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios. Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97 ($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and 0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate 3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features. Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation, and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering informed patient choices across medical applications.

  Compressed video quality enhancement (CVQE) is crucial for improving user experience with lossy video codecs like H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, and H.266/VVC. While deep learning based CVQE has driven significant progress, existing surveys still suffer from limitations: lack of systematic classification linking methods to specific standards and artifacts, insufficient comparative analysis of architectural paradigms across coding types, and underdeveloped benchmarking practices. To address these gaps, this paper presents three key contributions. First, it introduces a novel taxonomy classifying CVQE methods across architectural paradigms, coding standards, and compressed-domain feature utilization. Second, it proposes a unified benchmarking framework integrating modern compression protocols and standard test sequences for fair multi-criteria evaluation. Third, it provides a systematic analysis of the critical trade-offs between reconstruction performance and computational complexity observed in state-of-the-art methods and highlighting promising directions for future research. This comprehensive review aims to establish a foundation for consistent assessment and informed model selection in CVQE research and deployment.

  Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource, low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in projection domain. ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations. First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over 200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments, ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET acquisition physics. Experimental results show that ALL-PET achieves high-quality sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

  Mobile reconstruction has the potential to support time-critical tasks such as tele-guidance and disaster response, where operators must quickly gain an accurate understanding of the environment. Full high-fidelity scene reconstruction is computationally expensive and often unnecessary when only specific points of interest (POIs) matter for timely decision making. We address this challenge with CoRe-GS, a semantic POI-focused extension of Gaussian Splatting (GS). Instead of optimizing every scene element uniformly, CoRe-GS first produces a fast segmentation-ready GS representation and then selectively refines splats belonging to semantically relevant POIs detected during data acquisition. This targeted refinement reduces training time to 25\% compared to full semantic GS while improving novel view synthesis quality in the areas that matter most. We validate CoRe-GS on both real-world (SCRREAM) and synthetic (NeRDS 360) datasets, demonstrating that prioritizing POIs enables faster and higher-quality mobile reconstruction tailored to operational needs.

  Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS, a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstruction-based methods have demonstrated very promising results for 3D anomaly detection. However, these methods face great challenges in handling high-precision point clouds due to the large scale and complex structure. In this study, a Down-Up Sampling Network (DUS-Net) is proposed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds for 3D anomaly detection by preserving the group center geometric structure. The DUS-Net first introduces a Noise Generation module to generate noisy patches, which facilitates the diversity of training data and strengthens the feature representation for reconstruction. Then, a Down-sampling Network (Down-Net) is developed to learn an anomaly-free center point cloud from patches with noise injection. Subsequently, an Up-sampling Network (Up-Net) is designed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds by fusing multi-scale up-sampling features. Our method leverages group centers for construction, enabling the preservation of geometric structure and providing a more precise point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an Object-level AUROC of 79.9% and 79.5%, and a Point-level AUROC of 71.2% and 84.7% on the Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet datasets, respectively.

  Generating 3D worlds from text is a highly anticipated goal in computer vision. Existing works are limited by the degree of exploration they allow inside of a scene, i.e., produce streched-out and noisy artifacts when moving beyond central or panoramic perspectives. To this end, we propose WorldExplorer, a novel method based on autoregressive video trajectory generation, which builds fully navigable 3D scenes with consistent visual quality across a wide range of viewpoints. We initialize our scenes by creating multi-view consistent images corresponding to a 360 degree panorama. Then, we expand it by leveraging video diffusion models in an iterative scene generation pipeline. Concretely, we generate multiple videos along short, pre-defined trajectories, that explore the scene in depth, including motion around objects. Our novel scene memory conditions each video on the most relevant prior views, while a collision-detection mechanism prevents degenerate results, like moving into objects. Finally, we fuse all generated views into a unified 3D representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization. Compared to prior approaches, WorldExplorer produces high-quality scenes that remain stable under large camera motion, enabling for the first time realistic and unrestricted exploration. We believe this marks a significant step toward generating immersive and truly explorable virtual 3D environments.

  Hinged on the representation power of neural networks, neural radiance fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as one of the promising and widely applicable methods for 3D object and scene representation. However, NeRF faces challenges in practical applications, such as large-scale scenes and edge devices with a limited amount of memory, where data needs to be processed sequentially. Under such incremental learning scenarios, neural networks are known to suffer catastrophic forgetting: easily forgetting previously seen data after training with new data. We observe that previous incremental learning algorithms are limited by either low performance or memory scalability issues. As such, we develop a Memory-Efficient Incremental Learning algorithm for NeRF (MEIL-NeRF). MEIL-NeRF takes inspiration from NeRF itself in that a neural network can serve as a memory that provides the pixel RGB values, given rays as queries. Upon the motivation, our framework learns which rays to query NeRF to extract previous pixel values. The extracted pixel values are then used to train NeRF in a self-distillation manner to prevent catastrophic forgetting. As a result, MEIL-NeRF demonstrates constant memory consumption and competitive performance.

  Poor sitting posture is a critical yet often overlooked factor contributing to long-term musculoskeletal disorders and physiological dysfunctions. Existing sitting posture monitoring systems, although leveraging visual, IMU, or pressure-based modalities, often suffer from coarse-grained recognition and lack the semantic expressiveness necessary for personalized feedback. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SitLLM}, a lightweight multimodal framework that integrates flexible pressure sensing with large language models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented response generation. SitLLM comprises three key components: (1) a \textit{Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module} that partitions pressure maps into spatial patches and injects local noise perturbations for robust feature extraction; (2) a \textit{Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module} that reprograms sensor embeddings into the LLM's semantic space via multi-head cross-attention using the pre-trained vocabulary embeddings; and (3) a \textit{Multi-Context Prompt Module} that fuses feature-level, structure-level, statistical-level, and semantic-level contextual information to guide instruction comprehension.

  Reasoning language models such as DeepSeek-R1 produce long chain-of-thought traces during inference time which make them costly to deploy at scale. We show that using compression techniques such as neural network pruning produces greater performance loss than in typical language modeling tasks, and in some cases can make the model slower since they cause the model to produce more thinking tokens but with worse performance. We show that this is partly due to the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction, whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces. This "Reasoning-Aware Compression" (RAC) integrates seamlessly into existing pruning workflows such as SparseGPT, and boosts their performance significantly.
