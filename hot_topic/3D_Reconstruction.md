- **[CaLiV: LiDAR-to-Vehicle Calibration of Arbitrary Sensor Setups via Object Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01987)**  `arXiv:2504.01987`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  In autonomous systems, sensor calibration is essential for a safe and efficient navigation in dynamic environments. Accurate calibration is a prerequisite for reliable perception and planning tasks such as object detection and obstacle avoidance. Many existing LiDAR calibration methods require overlapping fields of view, while others use external sensing devices or postulate a feature-rich environment. In addition, Sensor-to-Vehicle calibration is not supported by the vast majority of calibration algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel target-based technique for extrinsic Sensor-to-Sensor and Sensor-to-Vehicle calibration of multi-LiDAR systems called CaLiV. This algorithm works for non-overlapping FoVs, as well as arbitrary calibration targets, and does not require any external sensing devices. First, we apply motion to produce FoV overlaps and utilize a simple unscented Kalman filter to obtain vehicle poses. Then, we use the Gaussian mixture model-based registration framework GMMCalib to align the point clouds in a common calibration frame. Finally, we reduce the task of recovering the sensor extrinsics to a minimization problem. We show that both translational and rotational Sensor-to-Sensor errors can be solved accurately by our method. In addition, all Sensor-to-Vehicle rotation angles can also be calibrated with high accuracy. We validate the simulation results in real-world experiments. The code is open source and available onthis https URL.

- **[Temporal Gaussian Copula For Clinical Multivariate Time Series Data Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02317)**  `arXiv:2504.02317`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  The imputation of the Multivariate time series (MTS) is particularly challenging since the MTS typically contains irregular patterns of missing values due to various factors such as instrument failures, interference from irrelevant data, and privacy regulations. Existing statistical methods and deep learning methods have shown promising results in time series imputation. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Gaussian Copula Model (TGC) for three-order MTS imputation. The key idea is to leverage the Gaussian Copula to explore the cross-variable and temporal relationships based on the latent Gaussian representation. Subsequently, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to improve robustness in managing data with varying missing rates. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on three real-world MTS datasets. The results demonstrate that our TGC substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art imputation methods. Additionally, the TGC model exhibits stronger robustness to the varying missing ratios in the test dataset. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Convolution-Based Converter : A Weak-Prior Approach For Modeling Stochastic Processes Based On Conditional Density Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06829)**  `arXiv:2502.06829`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Chaoran Pang, Lin Wang, Shuangrong Liu, Shikun Tian, WenHao Yue, Xingshen Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, a Convolution-Based Converter (CBC) is proposed to develop a methodology for removing the strong or fixed priors in estimating the probability distribution of targets based on observations in the stochastic process. Traditional approaches, e.g., Markov-based and Gaussian process-based methods, typically leverage observations to estimate targets based on strong or fixed priors (such as Markov properties or Gaussian prior). However, the effectiveness of these methods depends on how well their prior assumptions align with the characteristics of the problem. When the assumed priors are not satisfied, these approaches may perform poorly or even become unusable. To overcome the above limitation, we introduce the Convolution-Based converter (CBC), which implicitly estimates the conditional probability distribution of targets without strong or fixed priors, and directly outputs the expected trajectory of the stochastic process that satisfies the constraints from observations. This approach reduces the dependence on priors, enhancing flexibility and adaptability in modeling stochastic processes when addressing different problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics.

- **[ADO-LLM: Analog Design Bayesian Optimization with In-Context Learning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18770)**  `arXiv:2406.18770`  `cs.LG`  
  _Yuxuan Yin, Yu Wang, Boxun Xu, Peng Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Analog circuit design requires substantial human expertise and involvement, which is a significant roadblock to design productivity. Bayesian Optimization (BO), a popular machine learning based optimization strategy, has been leveraged to automate analog design given its applicability across various circuit topologies and technologies. Traditional BO methods employ black box Gaussian Process surrogate models and optimized labeled data queries to find optimization solutions by trading off between exploration and exploitation. However, the search for the optimal design solution in BO can be expensive from both a computational and data usage point of view, particularly for high dimensional optimization problems. This paper presents ADO-LLM, the first work integrating large language models (LLMs) with Bayesian Optimization for analog design optimization. ADO-LLM leverages the LLM's ability to infuse domain knowledge to rapidly generate viable design points to remedy BO's inefficiency in finding high value design areas specifically under the limited design space coverage of the BO's probabilistic surrogate model. In the meantime, sampling of design points evaluated in the iterative BO process provides quality demonstrations for the LLM to generate high quality design points while leveraging infused broad design knowledge. Furthermore, the diversity brought by BO's exploration enriches the contextual understanding of the LLM and allows it to more broadly search in the design space and prevent repetitive and redundant suggestions. We evaluate the proposed framework on two different types of analog circuits and demonstrate notable improvements in design efficiency and effectiveness.

- **[Efficient Long Video Tokenization via Coordinate-based Patch Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14762)**  `arXiv:2411.14762`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Huiwon Jang, Sihyun Yu, Jinwoo Shin, Pieter Abbeel, Younggyo Seo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient tokenization of videos remains a challenge in training vision models that can process long videos. One promising direction is to develop a tokenizer that can encode long video clips, as it would enable the tokenizer to leverage the temporal coherence of videos better for tokenization. However, training existing tokenizers on long videos often incurs a huge training cost as they are trained to reconstruct all the frames at once. In this paper, we introduce CoordTok, a video tokenizer that learns a mapping from coordinate-based representations to the corresponding patches of input videos, inspired by recent advances in 3D generative models. In particular, CoordTok encodes a video into factorized triplane representations and reconstructs patches that correspond to randomly sampled $(x,y,t)$ coordinates. This allows for training large tokenizer models directly on long videos without requiring excessive training resources. Our experiments show that CoordTok can drastically reduce the number of tokens for encoding long video clips. For instance, CoordTok can encode a 128-frame video with 128$\times$128 resolution into 1280 tokens, while baselines need 6144 or 8192 tokens to achieve similar reconstruction quality. We further show that this efficient video tokenization enables memory-efficient training of a diffusion transformer that can generate 128 frames at once.

- **[Scene Splatter: Momentum 3D Scene Generation from Single Image with Video Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02764)**  `arXiv:2504.02764`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Shengjun Zhang, Jinzhao Li, Xin Fei, Hao Liu, Yueqi Duan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose Scene Splatter, a momentum-based paradigm for video diffusion to generate generic scenes from single image. Existing methods, which employ video generation models to synthesize novel views, suffer from limited video length and scene inconsistency, leading to artifacts and distortions during further reconstruction. To address this issue, we construct noisy samples from original features as momentum to enhance video details and maintain scene consistency. However, for latent features with the perception field that spans both known and unknown regions, such latent-level momentum restricts the generative ability of video diffusion in unknown regions. Therefore, we further introduce the aforementioned consistent video as a pixel-level momentum to a directly generated video without momentum for better recovery of unseen regions. Our cascaded momentum enables video diffusion models to generate both high-fidelity and consistent novel views. We further finetune the global Gaussian representations with enhanced frames and render new frames for momentum update in the next step. In this manner, we can iteratively recover a 3D scene, avoiding the limitation of video length. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization capability and superior performance of our method in high-fidelity and consistent scene generation.

- **[ConsDreamer: Advancing Multi-View Consistency for Zero-Shot Text-to-3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02316)**  `arXiv:2504.02316`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in zero-shot text-to-3D generation have revolutionized 3D content creation by enabling direct synthesis from textual descriptions. While state-of-the-art methods leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting with score distillation to enhance multi-view rendering through pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models, they suffer from inherent view biases in T2I priors. These biases lead to inconsistent 3D generation, particularly manifesting as the multi-face Janus problem, where objects exhibit conflicting features across views. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose ConsDreamer, a novel framework that mitigates view bias by refining both the conditional and unconditional terms in the score distillation process: (1) a View Disentanglement Module (VDM) that eliminates viewpoint biases in conditional prompts by decoupling irrelevant view components and injecting precise camera parameters; and (2) a similarity-based partial order loss that enforces geometric consistency in the unconditional term by aligning cosine similarities with azimuth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsDreamer effectively mitigates the multi-face Janus problem in text-to-3D generation, outperforming existing methods in both visual quality and consistency.

- **[APHQ-ViT: Post-Training Quantization with Average Perturbation Hessian Based Reconstruction for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02508)**  `arXiv:2504.02508`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhuguanyu Wu, Jiayi Zhang, Jiaxin Chen, Jinyang Guo, Di Huang, Yunhong Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become one of the most commonly used backbones for vision tasks. Despite their remarkable performance, they often suffer significant accuracy drops when quantized for practical deployment, particularly by post-training quantization (PTQ) under ultra-low bits. Recently, reconstruction-based PTQ methods have shown promising performance in quantizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, they fail when applied to ViTs, primarily due to the inaccurate estimation of output importance and the substantial accuracy degradation in quantizing post-GELU activations. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{APHQ-ViT}, a novel PTQ approach based on importance estimation with Average Perturbation Hessian (APH). Specifically, we first thoroughly analyze the current approximation approaches with Hessian loss, and propose an improved average perturbation Hessian loss. To deal with the quantization of the post-GELU activations, we design an MLP Reconstruction (MR) method by replacing the GELU function in MLP with ReLU and reconstructing it by the APH loss on a small unlabeled calibration set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APHQ-ViT using linear quantizers outperforms existing PTQ methods by substantial margins in 3-bit and 4-bit across different vision tasks.

- **[MonoGS++: Fast and Accurate Monocular RGB Gaussian SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02437)**  `arXiv:2504.02437`  `cs.CV`  
  _Renwu Li, Wenjing Ke, Dong Li, Lu Tian, Emad Barsoum_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present MonoGS++, a novel fast and accurate Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) method that leverages 3D Gaussian representations and operates solely on RGB inputs. While previous 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based methods largely depended on depth sensors, our approach reduces the hardware dependency and only requires RGB input, leveraging online visual odometry (VO) to generate sparse point clouds in real-time. To reduce redundancy and enhance the quality of 3D scene reconstruction, we implemented a series of methodological enhancements in 3D Gaussian mapping. Firstly, we introduced dynamic 3D Gaussian insertion to avoid adding redundant Gaussians in previously well-reconstructed areas. Secondly, we introduced clarity-enhancing Gaussian densification module and planar regularization to handle texture-less areas and flat surfaces better. We achieved precise camera tracking results both on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD datasets, comparable to those of the state-of-the-art. Additionally, our method realized a significant 5.57x improvement in frames per second (fps) over the previous state-of-the-art, MonoGS.

- **[Generative Classifier for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02272)**  `arXiv:2504.02272`  `cs.CV`

  Domain generalization (DG) aims to improve the generalizability of computer vision models toward distribution shifts. The mainstream DG methods focus on learning domain invariance, however, such methods overlook the potential inherent in domain-specific information. While the prevailing practice of discriminative linear classifier has been tailored to domain-invariant features, it struggles when confronted with diverse domain-specific information, e.g., intra-class shifts, that exhibits multi-modality. To address these issues, we explore the theoretical implications of relying on domain invariance, revealing the crucial role of domain-specific information in mitigating the target risk for DG. Drawing from these insights, we propose Generative Classifier-driven Domain Generalization (GCDG), introducing a generative paradigm for the DG classifier based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for each class across domains. GCDG consists of three key modules: Heterogeneity Learning Classifier~(HLC), Spurious Correlation Blocking~(SCB), and Diverse Component Balancing~(DCB). Concretely, HLC attempts to model the feature distributions and thereby capture valuable domain-specific information via GMMs. SCB identifies the neural units containing spurious correlations and perturbs them, mitigating the risk of HLC learning spurious patterns. Meanwhile, DCB ensures a balanced contribution of components in HLC, preventing the underestimation or neglect of critical components. In this way, GCDG excels in capturing the nuances of domain-specific information characterized by diverse distributions. GCDG demonstrates the potential to reduce the target risk and encourage flat minima, improving the generalizability. Extensive experiments show GCDG's comparable performance on five DG benchmarks and one face anti-spoofing dataset, seamlessly integrating into existing DG methods with consistent improvements.

  _Jaehoon Choi, Dongki Jung, Yonghan Lee, Sungmin Eum, Dinesh Manocha, Heesung Kwon_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present UAVTwin, a method for creating digital twins from real-world environments and facilitating data augmentation for training downstream models embedded in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, our approach focuses on synthesizing foreground components, such as various human instances in motion within complex scene backgrounds, from UAV perspectives. This is achieved by integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reconstructing backgrounds along with controllable synthetic human models that display diverse appearances and actions in multiple poses. To the best of our knowledge, UAVTwin is the first approach for UAV-based perception that is capable of generating high-fidelity digital twins based on 3DGS. The proposed work significantly enhances downstream models through data augmentation for real-world environments with multiple dynamic objects and significant appearance variations-both of which typically introduce artifacts in 3DGS-based modeling. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel appearance modeling strategy and a mask refinement module to enhance the training of 3D Gaussian Splatting. We demonstrate the high quality of neural rendering by achieving a 1.23 dB improvement in PSNR compared to recent methods. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of data augmentation by showing a 2.5% to 13.7% improvement in mAP for the human detection task.

- **[Toward Real-world BEV Perception: Depth Uncertainty Estimation via Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01957)**  `arXiv:2504.01957`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shu-Wei Lu, Yi-Hsuan Tsai, Yi-Ting Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bird's-eye view (BEV) perception has gained significant attention because it provides a unified representation to fuse multiple view images and enables a wide range of down-stream autonomous driving tasks, such as forecasting and planning. Recent state-of-the-art models utilize projection-based methods which formulate BEV perception as query learning to bypass explicit depth estimation. While we observe promising advancements in this paradigm, they still fall short of real-world applications because of the lack of uncertainty modeling and expensive computational requirement. In this work, we introduce GaussianLSS, a novel uncertainty-aware BEV perception framework that revisits unprojection-based methods, specifically the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) paradigm, and enhances them with depth un-certainty modeling. GaussianLSS represents spatial dispersion by learning a soft depth mean and computing the variance of the depth distribution, which implicitly captures object extents. We then transform the depth distribution into 3D Gaussians and rasterize them to construct uncertainty-aware BEV features. We evaluate GaussianLSS on the nuScenes dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to unprojection-based methods. In particular, it provides significant advantages in speed, running 2.5x faster, and in memory efficiency, using 0.3x less memory compared to projection-based methods, while achieving competitive performance with only a 0.4% IoU difference.

- **[Traversing Distortion-Perception Tradeoff using a Single Score-Based Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20297)**  `arXiv:2503.20297`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yuhan Wang, Suzhi Bi, Ying-Jun Angela Zhang, Xiaojun Yuan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The distortion-perception (DP) tradeoff reveals a fundamental conflict between distortion metrics (e.g., MSE and PSNR) and perceptual quality. Recent research has increasingly concentrated on evaluating denoising algorithms within the DP framework. However, existing algorithms either prioritize perceptual quality by sacrificing acceptable distortion, or focus on minimizing MSE for faithful restoration. When the goal shifts or noisy measurements vary, adapting to different points on the DP plane needs retraining or even re-designing the model. Inspired by recent advances in solving inverse problems using score-based generative models, we explore the potential of flexibly and optimally traversing DP tradeoffs using a single pre-trained score-based model. Specifically, we introduce a variance-scaled reverse diffusion process and theoretically characterize the marginal distribution. We then prove that the proposed sample process is an optimal solution to the DP tradeoff for conditional Gaussian distribution. Experimental results on two-dimensional and image datasets illustrate that a single score network can effectively and flexibly traverse the DP tradeoff for general denoising problems.

- **[CFG-Zero*: Improved Classifier-Free Guidance for Flow Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18886)**  `arXiv:2503.18886`  `cs.CV`  
  _Weichen Fan, Amber Yijia Zheng, Raymond A. Yeh, Ziwei Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely adopted technique in diffusion/flow models to improve image fidelity and controllability. In this work, we first analytically study the effect of CFG on flow matching models trained on Gaussian mixtures where the ground-truth flow can be derived. We observe that in the early stages of training, when the flow estimation is inaccurate, CFG directs samples toward incorrect trajectories. Building on this observation, we propose CFG-Zero*, an improved CFG with two contributions: (a) optimized scale, where a scalar is optimized to correct for the inaccuracies in the estimated velocity, hence the * in the name; and (b) zero-init, which involves zeroing out the first few steps of the ODE solver. Experiments on both text-to-image (Lumina-Next, Stable Diffusion 3, and Flux) and text-to-video (Wan-2.1) generation demonstrate that CFG-Zero* consistently outperforms CFG, highlighting its effectiveness in guiding Flow Matching models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Probabilistic human motion prediction aims to forecast multiple possible future movements from past observations. While current approaches report high diversity and realism, they often generate motions with undetected limb stretching and jitter. To address this, we introduce SkeletonDiffusion, a latent diffusion model that embeds an explicit inductive bias on the human body within its architecture and training. Our model is trained with a novel nonisotropic Gaussian diffusion formulation that aligns with the natural kinematic structure of the human skeleton. Results show that our approach outperforms conventional isotropic alternatives, consistently generating realistic predictions while avoiding artifacts such as limb distortion. Additionally, we identify a limitation in commonly used diversity metrics, which may inadvertently favor models that produce inconsistent limb lengths within the same sequence. SkeletonDiffusion sets a new benchmark on real-world datasets, outperforming various baselines across multiple evaluation metrics. Visit our project page atthis https URL.

  _Yifei Liu, Zhihang Zhong, Yifan Zhan, Sheng Xu, Xiao Sun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in novel view synthesis and real-time rendering, the high memory consumption due to the use of millions of Gaussians limits its practicality. To mitigate this issue, improvements have been made by pruning unnecessary Gaussians, either through a hand-crafted criterion or by using learned masks. However, these methods deterministically remove Gaussians based on a snapshot of the pruning moment, leading to sub-optimized reconstruction performance from a long-term perspective. To address this issue, we introduce MaskGaussian, which models Gaussians as probabilistic entities rather than permanently removing them, and utilize them according to their probability of existence. To achieve this, we propose a masked-rasterization technique that enables unused yet probabilistically existing Gaussians to receive gradients, allowing for dynamic assessment of their contribution to the evolving scene and adjustment of their probability of existence. Hence, the importance of Gaussians iteratively changes and the pruned Gaussians are selected diversely. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in achieving better rendering quality with fewer Gaussians than previous pruning methods, pruning over 60% of Gaussians on average with only a 0.02 PSNR decline.
