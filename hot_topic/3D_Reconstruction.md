- **[Active Perception for Tactile Sensing: A Task-Agnostic Attention-Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06182)**  `arXiv:2505.06182`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans make extensive use of haptic exploration to map and identify the properties of the objects that we touch. In robotics, active tactile perception has emerged as an important research domain that complements vision for tasks such as object classification, shape reconstruction, and manipulation. This work introduces TAP (Task-agnostic Active Perception) -- a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) and transformer-based architectures to address the challenges posed by partially observable environments. TAP integrates Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and CrossQ algorithms within a unified optimization objective, jointly training a perception module and decision-making policy. By design, TAP is completely task-agnostic and can, in principle, generalize to any active perception problem. We evaluate TAP across diverse tasks, including toy examples and realistic applications involving haptic exploration of 3D models from the Tactile MNIST benchmark. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of TAP, achieving high accuracies on the Tactile MNIST haptic digit recognition task and a tactile pose estimation task. These findings underscore the potential of TAP as a versatile and generalizable framework for advancing active tactile perception in robotics.

- **[SPLATART: Articulated Gaussian Splatting with Estimated Object Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12184)**  `arXiv:2506.12184`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`  
  _Stanley Lewis, Vishal Chandra, Tom Gao, Odest Chadwicke Jenkins_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Representing articulated objects remains a difficult problem within the field of robotics. Objects such as pliers, clamps, or cabinets require representations that capture not only geometry and color information, but also part seperation, connectivity, and joint parametrization. Furthermore, learning these representations becomes even more difficult with each additional degree of freedom. Complex articulated objects such as robot arms may have seven or more degrees of freedom, and the depth of their kinematic tree may be notably greater than the tools, drawers, and cabinets that are the typical subjects of articulated object research. To address these concerns, we introduce SPLATART - a pipeline for learning Gaussian splat representations of articulated objects from posed images, of which a subset contains image space part segmentations. SPLATART disentangles the part separation task from the articulation estimation task, allowing for post-facto determination of joint estimation and representation of articulated objects with deeper kinematic trees than previously exhibited. In this work, we present data on the SPLATART pipeline as applied to the syntheic Paris dataset objects, and qualitative results on a real-world object under spare segmentation supervision. We additionally present on articulated serial chain manipulators to demonstrate usage on deeper kinematic tree structures.

- **[ActiveSplat: High-Fidelity Scene Reconstruction through Active Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21955)**  `arXiv:2410.21955`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`  
  _Yuetao Li, Zijia Kuang, Ting Li, Qun Hao, Zike Yan, Guyue Zhou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose ActiveSplat, an autonomous high-fidelity reconstruction system leveraging Gaussian splatting. Taking advantage of efficient and realistic rendering, the system establishes a unified framework for online mapping, viewpoint selection, and path planning. The key to ActiveSplat is a hybrid map representation that integrates both dense information about the environment and a sparse abstraction of the workspace. Therefore, the system leverages sparse topology for efficient viewpoint sampling and path planning, while exploiting view-dependent dense prediction for viewpoint selection, facilitating efficient decision-making with promising accuracy and completeness. A hierarchical planning strategy based on the topological map is adopted to mitigate repetitive trajectories and improve local granularity given limited time budgets, ensuring high-fidelity reconstruction with photorealistic view synthesis. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of reconstruction accuracy, data coverage, and exploration efficiency. The released code will be available on our project page:this https URL.

- **[Towards Efficient Occupancy Mapping via Gaussian Process Latent Field Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13640)**  `arXiv:2506.13640`  `cs.RO`  
  _Cedric Le Gentil, Cedric Pradalier, Timothy D. Barfoot_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Occupancy mapping has been a key enabler of mobile robotics. Originally based on a discrete grid representation, occupancy mapping has evolved towards continuous representations that can predict the occupancy status at any location and account for occupancy correlations between neighbouring areas. Gaussian Process (GP) approaches treat this task as a binary classification problem using both observations of occupied and free space. Conceptually, a GP latent field is passed through a logistic function to obtain the output class without actually manipulating the GP latent field. In this work, we propose to act directly on the latent function to efficiently integrate free space information as a prior based on the shape of the sensor's field-of-view. A major difference with existing methods is the change in the classification problem, as we distinguish between free and unknown space. The `occupied' area is the infinitesimally thin location where the class transitions from free to unknown. We demonstrate in simulated environments that our approach is sound and leads to competitive reconstruction accuracy.

- **[SceneComplete: Open-World 3D Scene Completion in Cluttered Real World Environments for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23643)**  `arXiv:2410.23643`  `cs.RO`  
  _Aditya Agarwal, Gaurav Singh, Bipasha Sen, Tom√°s Lozano-P√©rez, Leslie Pack Kaelbling_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Careful robot manipulation in every-day cluttered environments requires an accurate understanding of the 3D scene, in order to grasp and place objects stably and reliably and to avoid colliding with other objects. In general, we must construct such a 3D interpretation of a complex scene based on limited input, such as a single RGB-D image. We describe SceneComplete, a system for constructing a complete, segmented, 3D model of a scene from a single view. SceneComplete is a novel pipeline for composing general-purpose pretrained perception modules (vision-language, segmentation, image-inpainting, image-to-3D, visual-descriptors and pose-estimation) to obtain highly accurate results. We demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness with respect to ground-truth models in a large benchmark dataset and show that its accurate whole-object reconstruction enables robust grasp proposal generation, including for a dexterous hand. We release the code on our websitethis https URL.

- **[Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Prediction via Rule-Regularized Heteroscedastic Deep Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13111)**  `arXiv:2504.13111`  `cs.LG` `cs.RO`  
  _Kumar Manas, Christian Schlauch, Adrian Paschke, Christian Wirth, Nadja Klein_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher. Project page:this https URL.

- **[Entropic Time Schedulers for Generative Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13612)**  `arXiv:2504.13612`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Dejan Stancevic, Florian Handke, Luca Ambrogioni_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater improvements in the few NFEs regime.

- **[AI reconstruction of European weather from the Euro-Atlantic regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13758)**  `arXiv:2506.13758`  `cs.LG`  
  _A. Camilletti, G. Franch, E. Tomasi, M. Cristoforetti_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a non-linear AI-model designed to reconstruct monthly mean anomalies of the European temperature and precipitation based on the Euro-Atlantic Weather regimes (WR) indices. WR represent recurrent, quasi-stationary, and persistent states of the atmospheric circulation that exert considerable influence over the European weather, therefore offering an opportunity for sub-seasonal to seasonal forecasting. While much research has focused on studying the correlation and impacts of the WR on European weather, the estimation of ground-level climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation, from Euro-Atlantic WR remains largely unexplored and is currently limited to linear methods. The presented AI model can capture and introduce complex non-linearities in the relation between the WR indices, describing the state of the Euro-Atlantic atmospheric circulation and the corresponding surface temperature and precipitation anomalies in Europe. We discuss the AI-model performance in reconstructing the monthly mean two-meter temperature and total precipitation anomalies in the European winter and summer, also varying the number of WR used to describe the monthly atmospheric circulation. We assess the impact of errors on the WR indices in the reconstruction and show that a mean absolute relative error below 80% yields improved seasonal reconstruction compared to the ECMWF operational seasonal forecast system, SEAS5. As a demonstration of practical applicability, we evaluate the model using WR indices predicted by SEAS5, finding slightly better or comparable skill relative to the SEAS5 forecast itself. Our findings demonstrate that WR-based anomaly reconstruction, powered by AI tools, offers a promising pathway for sub-seasonal and seasonal forecasting.

- **[GeoRecon: Graph-Level Representation Learning for 3D Molecules via Reconstruction-Based Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13174)**  `arXiv:2506.13174`  `cs.LG`  
  _Shaoheng Yan, Zian Li, Muhan Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The pretraining-and-finetuning paradigm has driven significant advances across domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision, with representative pretraining paradigms such as masked language modeling and next-token prediction. However, in molecular representation learning, the task design remains largely limited to node-level denoising, which is effective at modeling local atomic environments, yet maybe insufficient for capturing the global molecular structure required by graph-level property prediction tasks, such as energy estimation and molecular regression. In this work, we present GeoRecon, a novel graph-level pretraining framework that shifts the focus from individual atoms to the molecule as an integrated whole. GeoRecon introduces a graph-level reconstruction task: during pretraining, the model is trained to generate an informative graph representation capable of accurately guiding reconstruction of the molecular geometry. This encourages the model to learn coherent, global structural features rather than isolated atomic details. Without relying on additional supervision or external data, GeoRecon outperforms node-centric baselines on multiple molecular benchmarks (e.g., QM9, MD17), demonstrating the benefit of incorporating graph-level reconstruction for learning more holistic and geometry-aware molecular embeddings.

- **[MetaEformer: Unveiling and Leveraging Meta-patterns for Complex and Dynamic Systems Load Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12800)**  `arXiv:2506.12800`  `cs.LG`  
  _Shaoyuan Huang, Tiancheng Zhang, Zhongtian Zhang, Xiaofei Wang, Lanjun Wang, Xin Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series forecasting is a critical and practical problem in many real-world applications, especially for industrial scenarios, where load forecasting underpins the intelligent operation of modern systems like clouds, power grids and trafficthis http URL, the inherent complexity and dynamics of these systems present significant challenges. Despite advances in methods such as pattern recognition and anti-non-stationarity have led to performance gains, current methods fail to consistently ensure effectiveness across various system scenarios due to the intertwined issues of complex patterns, concept-drift, and few-shot problems. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel scheme centered on fundamental waveform, a.k.a., meta-pattern. Specifically, we develop a unique Meta-pattern Pooling mechanism to purify and maintain meta-patterns, capturing the nuanced nature of system loads. Complementing this, the proposed Echo mechanism adaptively leverages the meta-patterns, enabling a flexible and precise pattern reconstruction. Our Meta-pattern Echo transformer (MetaEformer) seamlessly incorporates these mechanisms with the transformer-based predictor, offering end-to-end efficiency and interpretability of core processes. Demonstrating superior performance across eight benchmarks under three system scenarios, MetaEformer marks a significant advantage in accuracy, with a 37% relative improvement on fifteen state-of-the-art baselines.

- **[Free Privacy Protection for Wireless Federated Learning: Enjoy It or Suffer from It?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12749)**  `arXiv:2506.12749`  `cs.LG`  
  _Weicai Li, Tiejun Lv, Xiyu Zhao, Xin Yuan, Wei Ni_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inherent communication noises have the potential to preserve privacy for wireless federated learning (WFL) but have been overlooked in digital communication systems predominantly using floating-point number standards, e.g., IEEE 754, for data storage and transmission. This is due to the potentially catastrophic consequences of bit errors in floating-point numbers, e.g., on the sign or exponent bits. This paper presents a novel channel-native bit-flipping differential privacy (DP) mechanism tailored for WFL, where transmit bits are randomly flipped and communication noises are leveraged, to collectively preserve the privacy of WFL in digital communication systems. The key idea is to interpret the bit perturbation at the transmitter and bit errors caused by communication noises as a bit-flipping DP process. This is achieved by designing a new floating-point-to-fixed-point conversion method that only transmits the bits in the fraction part of model parameters, hence eliminating the need for transmitting the sign and exponent bits and preventing the catastrophic consequence of bit errors. We analyze a new metric to measure the bit-level distance of the model parameters and prove that the proposed mechanism satisfies (\lambda,\epsilon)-R√©nyi DP and does not violate the WFL convergence. Experiments validate privacy and convergence analysis of the proposed mechanism and demonstrate its superiority to the state-of-the-art Gaussian mechanisms that are channel-agnostic and add Gaussian noise for privacy protection.

- **[Fourier-Invertible Neural Encoder (FINE) for Homogeneous Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15329)**  `arXiv:2505.15329`  `cs.LG`  
  _Anqiao Ouyang, Hongyi Ke, Qi Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Invertible neural architectures have recently attracted attention for their compactness, interpretability, and information-preserving properties. In this work, we propose the Fourier-Invertible Neural Encoder (FINE), which combines invertible monotonic activation functions with reversible filter structures, and could be extended using Invertible ResNets. This architecture is examined in learning low-dimensional representations of one-dimensional nonlinear wave interactions and exact circular translation symmetry. Dimensionality is preserved across layers, except for a Fourier truncation step in the latent space, which enables dimensionality reduction while maintaining shift equivariance and interpretability. Our results demonstrate that FINE significantly outperforms classical linear methods such as Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and achieves reconstruction accuracy better than conventional deep autoencoders with convolutional layers (CNN) - while using substantially smaller models and offering superior physical interpretability. These findings suggest that invertible single-neuron networks, when combined with spectral truncation, offer a promising framework for learning compact and interpretable representations of physics datasets, and symmetry-aware representation learning in physics-informed machine learning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive Transformers are increasingly being deployed as end-to-end robot and autonomous vehicle (AV) policy architectures, owing to their scalability and potential to leverage internet-scale pretraining for generalization. Accordingly, tokenizing sensor data efficiently is paramount to ensuring the real-time feasibility of such architectures on embedded hardware. To this end, we present an efficient triplane-based multi-camera tokenization strategy that leverages recent advances in 3D neural reconstruction and rendering to produce sensor tokens that are agnostic to the number of input cameras and their resolution, while explicitly accounting for their geometry around an AV. Experiments on a large-scale AV dataset and state-of-the-art neural simulator demonstrate that our approach yields significant savings over current image patch-based tokenization strategies, producing up to 72% fewer tokens, resulting in up to 50% faster policy inference while achieving the same open-loop motion planning accuracy and improved offroad rates in closed-loop driving simulations.

  _Amit Kumar Singh, Vrijendra Singh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning and advancements in contactless sensors have significantly enhanced our ability to understand complex human activities in healthcare settings. In particular, deep learning models utilizing computer vision have been developed to enable detailed analysis of human gesture recognition, especially repetitive gestures which are commonly observed behaviors in children with autism. This research work aims to identify repetitive behaviors indicative of autism by analyzing videos captured in natural settings as children engage in daily activities. The focus is on accurately categorizing real-time repetitive gestures such as spinning, head banging, and arm flapping. To this end, we utilize the publicly accessible Self-Stimulatory Behavior Dataset (SSBD) to classify these stereotypical movements. A key component of the proposed methodology is the use of \textbf{VideoMAE}, a model designed to improve both spatial and temporal analysis of video data through a masking and reconstruction mechanism. This model significantly outperformed traditional methods, achieving an accuracy of 97.7\%, a 14.7\% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Salient object detection (SOD) plays a critical role in Intelligent Imaging, facilitating the detection and segmentation of key visual elements in an image. However, adverse imaging conditions such as haze during the day, low light, and haze at night severely degrade image quality and hinder reliable object detection in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-knowledge-oriented nighttime haze imaging enhancer (MKoIE), which integrates three tasks: daytime dehazing, low-light enhancement, and nighttime dehazing. The MKoIE incorporates two key innovative components: First, the network employs a task-oriented node learning mechanism to handle three specific degradation types: day-time haze, low light, and night-time haze conditions, with an embedded self-attention module enhancing its performance in nighttime imaging. In addition, multi-receptive field enhancement module that efficiently extracts multi-scale features through three parallel depthwise separable convolution branches with different dilation rates, capturing comprehensive spatial information with minimal computational overhead to meet the requirements of real-time imaging deployment. To ensure optimal image reconstruction quality and visual characteristics, we suggest a hybrid loss function. Extensive experiments on different types of weather/imaging conditions illustrate that MKoIE surpasses existing methods, enhancing the reliability, accuracy, and operational efficiency of intelligent imaging.

  Neuromorphic cameras, also known as event cameras, are asynchronous brightness-change sensors that can capture extremely fast motion without suffering from motion blur, making them particularly promising for 3D reconstruction in extreme environments. However, existing research on 3D reconstruction using monocular neuromorphic cameras is limited, and most of the methods rely on estimating physical priors and employ complex multi-step pipelines. In this work, we propose an end-to-end method for dense voxel 3D reconstruction using neuromorphic cameras that eliminates the need to estimate physical priors. Our method incorporates a novel event representation to enhance edge features, enabling the proposed feature-enhancement model to learn more effectively. Additionally, we introduced Optimal Binarization Threshold Selection Principle as a guideline for future related work, using the optimal reconstruction results achieved with threshold optimization as the benchmark. Our method achieves a 54.6% improvement in reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline method.

- **[PF-LHM: 3D Animatable Avatar Reconstruction from Pose-free Articulated Human Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13766)**  `arXiv:2506.13766`  `cs.CV`  
  _Lingteng Qiu, Peihao Li, Qi Zuo, Xiaodong Gu, Yuan Dong, Weihao Yuan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing an animatable 3D human from casually captured images of an articulated subject without camera or human pose information is a practical yet challenging task due to view misalignment, occlusions, and the absence of structural priors. While optimization-based methods can produce high-fidelity results from monocular or multi-view videos, they require accurate pose estimation and slow iterative optimization, limiting scalability in unconstrained scenarios. Recent feed-forward approaches enable efficient single-image reconstruction but struggle to effectively leverage multiple input images to reduce ambiguity and improve reconstruction accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose PF-LHM, a large human reconstruction model that generates high-quality 3D avatars in seconds from one or multiple casually captured pose-free images. Our approach introduces an efficient Encoder-Decoder Point-Image Transformer architecture, which fuses hierarchical geometric point features and multi-view image features through multimodal attention. The fused features are decoded to recover detailed geometry and appearance, represented using 3D Gaussian splats. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method unifies single- and multi-image 3D human reconstruction, achieving high-fidelity and animatable 3D human avatars without requiring camera and human pose annotations. Code and models will be released to the public.

  _Yuheng Yuan, Qiuhong Shen, Shizun Wang, Xingyi Yang, Xinchao Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dense matching methods like DUSt3R regress pairwise pointmaps for 3D reconstruction. However, the reliance on pairwise prediction and the limited generalization capability inherently restrict the global geometric consistency. In this work, we introduce Test3R, a surprisingly simple test-time learning technique that significantly boosts geometric accuracy. Using image triplets ($I_1,I_2,I_3$), Test3R generates reconstructions from pairs ($I_1,I_2$) and ($I_1,I_3$). The core idea is to optimize the network at test time via a self-supervised objective: maximizing the geometric consistency between these two reconstructions relative to the common image $I_1$. This ensures the model produces cross-pair consistent outputs, regardless of the inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our technique significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on the 3D reconstruction and multi-view depth estimation tasks. Moreover, it is universally applicable and nearly cost-free, making it easily applied to other models and implemented with minimal test-time training overhead and parameter footprint. Code is available atthis https URL.

  _Junyoung Seo, Jisang Han, Jaewoo Jung, Siyoon Jin, Joungbin Lee, Takuya Narihira, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Vid-CamEdit, a novel framework for video camera trajectory editing, enabling the re-synthesis of monocular videos along user-defined camera paths. This task is challenging due to its ill-posed nature and the limited multi-view video data for training. Traditional reconstruction methods struggle with extreme trajectory changes, and existing generative models for dynamic novel view synthesis cannot handle in-the-wild videos. Our approach consists of two steps: estimating temporally consistent geometry, and generative rendering guided by this geometry. By integrating geometric priors, the generative model focuses on synthesizing realistic details where the estimated geometry is uncertain. We eliminate the need for extensive 4D training data through a factorized fine-tuning framework that separately trains spatial and temporal components using multi-view image and video data. Our method outperforms baselines in producing plausible videos from novel camera trajectories, especially in extreme extrapolation scenarios on real-world footage.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To address the challenges of 3D modeling and structural simulation in industrial environment, such as the difficulty of equipment deployment, and the difficulty of balancing accuracy and real-time performance, this paper proposes an integrated workflow, which integrates high-fidelity 3D reconstruction based on monocular video, finite element simulation analysis, and mixed reality visual display, aiming to build an interactive digital twin system for industrial inspection, equipment maintenance and other scenes. Firstly, the Neuralangelo algorithm based on deep learning is used to reconstruct the 3D mesh model with rich details from the surround-shot video. Then, the QuadRemesh tool of Rhino is used to optimize the initial triangular mesh and generate a structured mesh suitable for finite element analysis. The optimized mesh is further discretized by HyperMesh, and the material parameter setting and stress simulation are carried out in Abaqus to obtain high-precision stress and deformation results. Finally, combined with Unity and Vuforia engine, the real-time superposition and interactive operation of simulation results in the augmented reality environment are realized, which improves users 'intuitive understanding of structural response. Experiments show that the method has good simulation efficiency and visualization effect while maintaining high geometric accuracy. It provides a practical solution for digital modeling, mechanical analysis and interactive display in complex industrial scenes, and lays a foundation for the deep integration of digital twin and mixed reality technology in industrial applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in clinical radiotherapy for image-guided treatment, improving setup accuracy, adaptive planning, and motion management. However, slow gantry rotation limits performance by introducing motion artifacts, blurring, and increased dose. This work aims to develop a clinically feasible method for reconstructing high-quality CBCT volumes from consecutive limited-angle acquisitions, addressing imaging challenges in time- or dose-constrained settings. We propose a limited-angle (LA) geometry-integrated cycle-domain (LA-GICD) framework for CBCT reconstruction, comprising two denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) connected via analytic cone-beam forward and back projectors. A Projection-DDPM completes missing projections, followed by back-projection, and an Image-DDPM refines the volume. This dual-domain design leverages complementary priors from projection and image spaces to achieve high-quality reconstructions from limited-angle (<= 90 degrees) scans. Performance was evaluated against full-angle reconstruction. Four board-certified medical physicists conducted assessments. A total of 78 planning CTs in common CBCT geometries were used for training and evaluation. The method achieved a mean absolute error of 35.5 HU, SSIM of 0.84, and PSNR of 29.8 dB, with visibly reduced artifacts and improved soft-tissue clarity. LA-GICD's geometry-aware dual-domain learning, embedded in analytic forward/backward operators, enabled artifact-free, high-contrast reconstructions from a single 90-degree scan, reducing acquisition time and dose four-fold. LA-GICD improves limited-angle CBCT reconstruction with strong data fidelity and anatomical realism. It offers a practical solution for short-arc acquisitions, enhancing CBCT use in radiotherapy by providing clinically applicable images with reduced scan time and dose for more accurate, personalized treatments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing 3D scenes from unconstrained image collections poses significant challenges due to variations in appearance. In this paper, we propose Scalable Micro-macro Wavelet-based Gaussian Splatting (SMW-GS), a novel method that enhances 3D reconstruction across diverse scales by decomposing scene representations into global, refined, and intrinsic components. SMW-GS incorporates the following innovations: Micro-macro Projection, which enables Gaussian points to sample multi-scale details with improved diversity; and Wavelet-based Sampling, which refines feature representations using frequency-domain information to better capture complex scene appearances. To achieve scalability, we further propose a large-scale scene promotion strategy, which optimally assigns camera views to scene partitions by maximizing their contributions to Gaussian points, achieving consistent and high-quality reconstructions even in expansive environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SMW-GS significantly outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction quality and scalability, particularly excelling in large-scale urban environments with challenging illumination variations.

  Predicting mortality-related outcomes from images offers the prospect of accessible, noninvasive, and scalable health screening. We present a method that leverages pretrained vision transformer foundation models to estimate remaining lifespan from facial and whole-body images, alongside robust uncertainty quantification. We show that predictive uncertainty varies systematically with the true remaining lifespan, and that this uncertainty can be effectively modeled by learning a Gaussian distribution for each sample. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.48 years on an established Dataset, and further improves to 4.79 and 5.07 years MAE on two new, higher-quality datasets curated and published in this work. Importantly, our models provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, as demonstrated by a bucketed expected calibration error of 0.62 years. While not intended for clinical deployment, these results highlight the potential of extracting medically relevant signals from images. We make all code and datasets available to facilitate further research.

  Video face restoration faces a critical challenge in maintaining temporal consistency while recovering fine facial details from degraded inputs. This paper presents a novel approach that extends Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), pretrained on static high-quality portraits, into a video restoration framework through variational latent space modeling. Our key innovation lies in reformulating discrete codebook representations as Dirichlet-distributed continuous variables, enabling probabilistic transitions between facial features across frames. A spatio-temporal Transformer architecture jointly models inter-frame dependencies and predicts latent distributions, while a Laplacian-constrained reconstruction loss combined with perceptual (LPIPS) regularization enhances both pixel accuracy and visual quality. Comprehensive evaluations on blind face restoration, video inpainting, and facial colorization tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. This work establishes an effective paradigm for adapting intensive image priors, pretrained on high-quality images, to video restoration while addressing the critical challenge of flicker artifacts.

  Facial texture generation is crucial for high-fidelity 3D face reconstruction from a single image. However, existing methods struggle to generate UV albedo maps with high-frequency details. To address this challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end coarse-to-fine approach for UV albedo map generation. Our method first utilizes a UV Albedo Parametric Model (UVAPM), driven by low-dimensional coefficients, to generate coarse albedo maps with skin tones and low-frequency texture details. To capture high-frequency details, we train a detail generator using a decoupled albedo map dataset, producing high-resolution albedo maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate high-fidelity textures from a single image, outperforming existing methods in terms of texture quality and realism. The code and pre-trained model are publicly available atthis https URL, facilitating reproducibility and further research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, patch deformation-based methods have demonstrated significant effectiveness in multi-view stereo due to their incorporation of deformable and expandable perception for reconstructing textureless areas. However, these methods generally focus on identifying reliable pixel correlations to mitigate matching ambiguity of patch deformation, while neglecting the deformation instability caused by edge-skipping and visibility occlusions, which may cause potential estimation deviations. To address these issues, we propose DVP-MVS++, an innovative approach that synergizes both depth-normal-edge aligned and harmonized cross-view priors for robust and visibility-aware patch deformation. Specifically, to avoid edge-skipping, we first apply DepthPro, Metric3Dv2 and Roberts operator to generate coarse depth maps, normal maps and edge maps, respectively. These maps are then aligned via an erosion-dilation strategy to produce fine-grained homogeneous boundaries for facilitating robust patch deformation. Moreover, we reformulate view selection weights as visibility maps, and then implement both an enhanced cross-view depth reprojection and an area-maximization strategy to help reliably restore visible areas and effectively balance deformed patch, thus acquiring harmonized cross-view priors for visibility-aware patch deformation. Additionally, we obtain geometry consistency by adopting both aggregated normals via view selection and projection depth differences via epipolar lines, and then employ SHIQ for highlight correction to enable geometry consistency with highlight-aware perception, thus improving reconstruction quality during propagation and refinement stage. Evaluation results on ETH3D, Tanks & Temples and Strecha datasets exhibit the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capability of our proposed method.

  Prototype-based reconstruction methods for unsupervised anomaly detection utilize a limited set of learnable prototypes which only aggregates insufficient normal information, resulting in undesirable reconstruction. However, increasing the number of prototypes may lead to anomalies being well reconstructed through the attention mechanism, which we refer to as the "Soft Identity Mapping" problem. In this paper, we propose Pro-AD to address these issues and fully utilize the prototypes to boost the performance of anomaly detection. Specifically, we first introduce an expanded set of learnable prototypes to provide sufficient capacity for semantic information. Then we employ a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder which integrates the process of the normal information aggregation and the target feature reconstruction via prototypes, with the aim of allowing the prototypes to aggregate more comprehensive normal semantic information from different levels of the image features and the target feature reconstruction to not only utilize its contextual information but also dynamically leverage the learned comprehensive prototypes. Additionally, to prevent the anomalies from being well reconstructed using sufficient semantic information through the attention mechanism, Pro-AD introduces a Prototype-based Constraint that applied within the target feature reconstruction process of the decoder, which further improves the performance of our approach. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our Pro-AD achieve state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its superior robustness and practical effectiveness for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection task.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) is tasked with pinpointing temporal intervals containing anomalous events within untrimmed videos, utilizing only video-level annotations. However, a significant challenge arises due to the absence of dense frame-level annotations, often leading to incomplete localization in existing WS-VAD methods. To address this issue, we present a novel LEC-VAD, Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection, which features a dual structure designed to encode both category-aware and category-agnostic semantics between vision and language. Within LEC-VAD, we devise semantic regularities that leverage an anomaly-aware Gaussian mixture to learn precise event boundaries, thereby yielding more complete event instances. Besides, we develop a novel memory bank-based prototype learning mechanism to enrich concise text descriptions associated with anomaly-event categories. This innovation bolsters the text's expressiveness, which is crucial for advancing WS-VAD. Our LEC-VAD demonstrates remarkable advancements over the current state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets XD-Violence and UCF-Crime.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose an adaptive sampling framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that leverages comprehensive multi-view photometric error signals within a unified Metropolis-Hastings approach. Traditional 3DGS methods heavily rely on heuristic-based density-control mechanisms (e.g., cloning, splitting, and pruning), which can lead to redundant computations or the premature removal of beneficial Gaussians. Our framework overcomes these limitations by reformulating densification and pruning as a probabilistic sampling process, dynamically inserting and relocating Gaussians based on aggregated multi-view errors and opacity scores. Guided by Bayesian acceptance tests derived from these error-based importance scores, our method substantially reduces reliance on heuristics, offers greater flexibility, and adaptively infers Gaussian distributions without requiring predefined scene complexity. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep Blending, show that our approach reduces the number of Gaussians needed, enhancing computational efficiency while matching or modestly surpassing the view-synthesis quality of state-of-the-art models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have attracted significant interest for their ability to model complex signals by mapping spatial and temporal coordinates to signal values. In the context of neural video representation, several decoding strategies have been explored to balance compactness and reconstruction quality, including pixel-wise, frame-wise, and patch-wise methods. Patch-wise decoding aims to combine the flexibility of pixel-based models with the efficiency of frame-based approaches. However, conventional uniform patch division often leads to discontinuities at patch boundaries, as independently reconstructed regions may fail to form a coherent global structure. To address this limitation, we propose a neural video representation method based on Structure-Preserving Patches (SPPs). Our approach rearranges each frame into a set of spatially structured patch frames using a PixelUnshuffle-like operation. This rearrangement maintains the spatial coherence of the original frame while enabling patch-level decoding. The network learns to predict these rearranged patch frames, which supports a global-to-local fitting strategy and mitigates degradation caused by upsampling. Experiments on standard video datasets show that the proposed method improves reconstruction quality and compression performance compared to existing INR-based video representation methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a preferred choice alongside Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in inverse rendering due to its superior rendering speed. Currently, the common approach in 3DGS is to utilize "single-view" mini-batch training, where only one image is processed per iteration, in contrast to NeRF's "multi-view" mini-batch training, which leverages multiple images. We observe that such single-view training can lead to suboptimal optimization due to increased variance in mini-batch stochastic gradients, highlighting the necessity for multi-view training. However, implementing multi-view training in 3DGS poses challenges. Simply rendering multiple images per iteration incurs considerable overhead and may result in suboptimal Gaussian densification due to its reliance on single-view assumptions. To address these issues, we modify the rasterization process to minimize the overhead associated with multi-view training and propose a 3D distance-aware D-SSIM loss and multi-view adaptive density control that better suits multi-view scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly enhance the performance of 3DGS and its variants, freeing 3DGS from the constraints of single-view training.

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for novel view synthesis. However, existing methods struggle to adaptively optimize the distribution of Gaussian primitives based on scene characteristics, making it challenging to balance reconstruction quality and efficiency. Inspired by human perception, we propose scene-adaptive perceptual densification for Gaussian Splatting (Perceptual-GS), a novel framework that integrates perceptual sensitivity into the 3DGS training process to address this challenge. We first introduce a perception-aware representation that models human visual sensitivity while constraining the number of Gaussian primitives. Building on this foundation, we develop a \cameraready{perceptual sensitivity-adaptive distribution} to allocate finer Gaussian granularity to visually critical regions, enhancing reconstruction quality and robustness. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets, including BungeeNeRF for large-scale scenes, demonstrate that Perceptual-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction quality, efficiency, and robustness.

  _Guoyi Zhang, Guangsheng Xu, Siyang Chen, Han Wang, Xiaohu Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework, termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

  We present Genesis, a unified framework for joint generation of multi-view driving videos and LiDAR sequences with spatio-temporal and cross-modal consistency. Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics (FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611), and benefits downstream tasks including segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical utility of the generated data.

  We introduce R2LDM, an innovative approach for generating dense and accurate 4D radar point clouds, guided by corresponding LiDAR point clouds. Instead of utilizing range images or bird's eye view (BEV) images, we represent both LiDAR and 4D radar point clouds using voxel features, which more effectively capture 3D shape information. Subsequently, we propose the Latent Voxel Diffusion Model (LVDM), which performs the diffusion process in the latent space. Additionally, a novel Latent Point Cloud Reconstruction (LPCR) module is utilized to reconstruct point clouds from high-dimensional latent voxel features. As a result, R2LDM effectively generates LiDAR-like point clouds from paired raw radar data. We evaluate our approach on two different datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves 6- to 10-fold densification of radar point clouds, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in 4D radar point cloud super-resolution. Furthermore, the enhanced radar point clouds generated by our method significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving up to 31.7% improvement in point cloud registration recall rate and 24.9% improvement in object detection accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a novel framework for modeling high-fidelity, animatable 3D human avatars from motion-blurred monocular video inputs. Motion blur is prevalent in real-world dynamic video capture, especially due to human movements in 3D human avatar modeling. Existing methods either (1) assume sharp image inputs, failing to address the detail loss introduced by motion blur, or (2) mainly consider blur by camera movements, neglecting the human motion blur which is more common in animatable avatars. Our proposed approach integrates a human movement-based motion blur model into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly modeling human motion trajectories during exposure time, we jointly optimize the trajectories and 3D Gaussians to reconstruct sharp, high-quality human avatars. We employ a pose-dependent fusion mechanism to distinguish moving body regions, optimizing both blurred and sharp areas effectively. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods in rendering quality and quantitative metrics, producing sharp avatar reconstructions and enabling real-time rendering under challenging motion blur conditions.

  While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in novel view synthesis and real-time rendering, the high memory consumption due to the use of millions of Gaussians limits its practicality. To mitigate this issue, improvements have been made by pruning unnecessary Gaussians, either through a hand-crafted criterion or by using learned masks. However, these methods deterministically remove Gaussians based on a snapshot of the pruning moment, leading to sub-optimized reconstruction performance from a long-term perspective. To address this issue, we introduce MaskGaussian, which models Gaussians as probabilistic entities rather than permanently removing them, and utilize them according to their probability of existence. To achieve this, we propose a masked-rasterization technique that enables unused yet probabilistically existing Gaussians to receive gradients, allowing for dynamic assessment of their contribution to the evolving scene and adjustment of their probability of existence. Hence, the importance of Gaussians iteratively changes and the pruned Gaussians are selected diversely. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in achieving better rendering quality with fewer Gaussians than previous pruning methods, pruning over 60% of Gaussians on average with only a 0.02 PSNR decline.

  Object pose estimation is essential to many industrial applications involving robotic manipulation, navigation, and augmented reality. Current generalizable object pose estimators, i.e., approaches that do not need to be trained per object, rely on accurate 3D models. Predominantly, CAD models are used, which can be hard to obtain in practice. At the same time, it is often possible to acquire images of an object. Naturally, this leads to the question whether 3D models reconstructed from images are sufficient to facilitate accurate object pose estimation. We aim to answer this question by proposing a novel benchmark for measuring the impact of 3D reconstruction quality on pose estimation accuracy. Our benchmark provides calibrated images for object reconstruction registered with the test images of the YCB-V dataset for pose evaluation under the BOP benchmark format. Detailed experiments with multiple state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction and object pose estimation approaches show that the geometry produced by modern reconstruction methods is often sufficient for accurate pose estimation. Our experiments lead to interesting observations: (1) Standard metrics for measuring 3D reconstruction quality are not necessarily indicative of pose estimation accuracy, which shows the need for dedicated benchmarks such as ours. (2) Classical, non-learning-based approaches can perform on par with modern learning-based reconstruction techniques and can even offer a better reconstruction time-pose accuracy tradeoff. (3) There is still a sizable gap between performance with reconstructed and with CAD models. To foster research on closing this gap, our benchmark is publicly available atthis https URL}.
