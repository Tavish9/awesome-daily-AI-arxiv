  Recent advancements in behavior cloning have enabled robots to perform complex manipulation tasks. However, accurately assessing training performance remains challenging, particularly for real-world applications, as behavior cloning losses often correlate poorly with actual task success. Consequently, researchers resort to success rate metrics derived from costly and time-consuming real-world evaluations, making the identification of optimal policies and detection of overfitting or underfitting impractical. To address these issues, we propose real-is-sim, a novel behavior cloning framework that incorporates a dynamic digital twin (based on Embodied Gaussians) throughout the entire policy development pipeline: data collection, training, and deployment. By continuously aligning the simulated world with the physical world, demonstrations can be collected in the real world with states extracted from the simulator. The simulator enables flexible state representations by rendering image inputs from any viewpoint or extracting low-level state information from objects embodied within the scene. During training, policies can be directly evaluated within the simulator in an offline and highly parallelizable manner. Finally, during deployment, policies are run within the simulator where the real robot directly tracks the simulated robot's joints, effectively decoupling policy execution from real hardware and mitigating traditional domain-transfer challenges. We validate real-is-sim on the PushT manipulation task, demonstrating strong correlation between success rates obtained in the simulator and real-world evaluations.

- **[Gaussian Process Tilted Nonparametric Density Estimation using Fisher Divergence Score Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03485)**  `arXiv:2504.03485`  `cs.LG`  
  _John Paisley, Wei Zhang, Brian Barr_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present three Fisher divergence (FD) minimization algorithms for learning Gaussian process (GP) based score models for lower dimensional density estimation problems. The density is formed by multiplying a base multivariate normal distribution with an exponentiated GP refinement, and so we refer to it as a GP-tilted nonparametric density. By representing the GP part of the score as a linear function using the random Fourier feature (RFF) approximation, we show that all learning problems can be solved in closed form. This includes the basic and noise conditional versions of the Fisher divergence, as well as a novel alternative to noise conditional FD models based on variational inference (VI). Here, we propose using an ELBO-like optimization of the approximate posterior with which we derive a Fisher variational predictive distribution. The RFF representation of the GP, which is functionally equivalent to a single layer neural network score model with cosine activation, provides a unique linear form for which all expectations are in closed form. The Gaussian base also helps with tractability of the VI approximation. We demonstrate our three learning algorithms, as well as a MAP baseline algorithm, on several low dimensional density estimation problems. The closed-form nature of the learning problem removes the reliance on iterative algorithms, making this technique particularly well-suited to large data sets.

- **[SGBA: Semantic Gaussian Mixture Model-Based LiDAR Bundle Adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01618)**  `arXiv:2410.01618`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Xingyu Ji, Shenghai Yuan, Jianping Li, Pengyu Yin, Haozhi Cao, Lihua Xie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LiDAR bundle adjustment (BA) is an effective approach to reduce the drifts in pose estimation from the front-end. Existing works on LiDAR BA usually rely on predefined geometric features for landmark representation. This reliance restricts generalizability, as the system will inevitably deteriorate in environments where these specific features are absent. To address this issue, we propose SGBA, a LiDAR BA scheme that models the environment as a semantic Gaussian mixture model (GMM) without predefined feature types. This approach encodes both geometric and semantic information, offering a comprehensive and general representation adaptable to various environments. Additionally, to limit computational complexity while ensuring generalizability, we propose an adaptive semantic selection framework that selects the most informative semantic clusters for optimization by evaluating the condition number of the cost function. Lastly, we introduce a probabilistic feature association scheme that considers the entire probability density of assignments, which can manage uncertainties in measurement and initial pose estimation. We have conducted various experiments and the results demonstrate that SGBA can achieve accurate and robust pose refinement even in challenging scenarios with low-quality initial pose estimation and limited geometric features. We plan to open-source the work for the benefit of the communitythis https URL.

- **[Compressing 3D Gaussian Splatting by Noise-Substituted Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03059)**  `arXiv:2504.03059`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in 3D reconstruction, achieving high-quality results with real-time radiance field rendering. However, a key challenge is the substantial storage cost: reconstructing a single scene typically requires millions of Gaussian splats, each represented by 59 floating-point parameters, resulting in approximately 1~GB of memory. To address this challenge, we propose a compression method by building separate attribute codebooks and storing only discrete code indices. Specifically, we employ noise-substituted vector quantization technique to jointly train the codebooks and model features, ensuring consistency between gradient descent optimization and parameter discretization. Our method reduces the memory consumption efficiently (around $45\times$) while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality on standard 3D benchmark scenes. Experiments on different codebook sizes show the trade-off between compression ratio and image quality. Furthermore, the trained compressed model remains fully compatible with popular 3DGS viewers and enables faster rendering speed, making it well-suited for practical applications.

- **[PyTorchGeoNodes: Enabling Differentiable Shape Programs for 3D Shape Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10620)**  `arXiv:2404.10620`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Sinisa Stekovic, Arslan Artykov, Stefan Ainetter, Mattia D'Urso, Friedrich Fraundorfer_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose PyTorchGeoNodes, a differentiable module for reconstructing 3D objects and their parameters from images using interpretable shape programs. Unlike traditional CAD model retrieval, shape programs allow reasoning about semantic parameters, editing, and a low memory footprint. Despite their potential, shape programs for 3D scene understanding have been largely overlooked. Our key contribution is enabling gradient-based optimization by parsing shape programs, or more precisely procedural models designed in Blender, into efficient PyTorch code. While there are many possible applications of our PyTochGeoNodes, we show that a combination of PyTorchGeoNodes with genetic algorithm is a method of choice to optimize both discrete and continuous shape program parameters for 3D reconstruction and understanding of 3D object parameters. Our modular framework can be further integrated with other reconstruction algorithms, and we demonstrate one such integration to enable procedural Gaussian splatting. Our experiments on the ScanNet dataset show that our method achieves accurate reconstructions while enabling, until now, unseen level of 3D scene understanding.

- **[BUFF: Bayesian Uncertainty Guided Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03490)**  `arXiv:2504.03490`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Zihao He, Shengchuan Zhang, Runze Hu, Yunhang Shen, Yan Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Super-resolution (SR) techniques are critical for enhancing image quality, particularly in scenarios where high-resolution imagery is essential yet limited by hardware constraints. Existing diffusion models for SR have relied predominantly on Gaussian models for noise generation, which often fall short when dealing with the complex and variable texture inherent in natural scenes. To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Bayesian Uncertainty Guided Diffusion Probabilistic Model (BUFF). BUFF distinguishes itself by incorporating a Bayesian network to generate high-resolution uncertainty masks. These masks guide the diffusion process, allowing for the adjustment of noise intensity in a manner that is both context-aware and adaptive. This novel approach not only enhances the fidelity of super-resolved images to their original high-resolution counterparts but also significantly mitigates artifacts and blurring in areas characterized by complex textures and fine details. The model demonstrates exceptional robustness against complex noise patterns and showcases superior adaptability in handling textures and edges within images. Empirical evidence, supported by visual results, illustrates the model's robustness, especially in challenging scenarios, and its effectiveness in addressing common SR issues such as blurring. Experimental evaluations conducted on the DIV2K dataset reveal that BUFF achieves a notable improvement, with a +0.61 increase compared to baseline in SSIM on BSD100, surpassing traditional diffusion approaches by an average additional +0.20dB PSNR gain. These findings underscore the potential of Bayesian methods in enhancing diffusion processes for SR, paving the way for future advancements in the field.

  Reconstructing 3D scenes from monocular surgical videos can enhance surgeon's perception and therefore plays a vital role in various computer-assisted surgery tasks. However, achieving scale-consistent reconstruction remains an open challenge due to inherent issues in endoscopic videos, such as dynamic deformations and textureless surfaces. Despite recent advances, current methods either rely on calibration or instrument priors to estimate scale, or employ SfM-like multi-stage pipelines, leading to error accumulation and requiring offline optimization. In this paper, we present Endo3R, a unified 3D foundation model for online scale-consistent reconstruction from monocular surgical video, without any priors or extra optimization. Our model unifies the tasks by predicting globally aligned pointmaps, scale-consistent video depths, and camera parameters without any offline optimization. The core contribution of our method is expanding the capability of the recent pairwise reconstruction model to long-term incremental dynamic reconstruction by an uncertainty-aware dual memory mechanism. The mechanism maintains history tokens of both short-term dynamics and long-term spatial consistency. Notably, to tackle the highly dynamic nature of surgical scenes, we measure the uncertainty of tokens via Sampson distance and filter out tokens with high uncertainty. Regarding the scarcity of endoscopic datasets with ground-truth depth and camera poses, we further devise a self-supervised mechanism with a novel dynamics-aware flow loss. Abundant experiments on SCARED and Hamlyn datasets demonstrate our superior performance in zero-shot surgical video depth prediction and camera pose estimation with online efficiency.

- **[Multimodal Diffusion Bridge with Attention-Based SAR Fusion for Satellite Image Cloud Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03607)**  `arXiv:2504.03607`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yuyang Hu, Suhas Lohit, Ulugbek S. Kamilov, Tim K. Marks_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning has achieved some success in addressing the challenge of cloud removal in optical satellite images, by fusing with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for cloud removal, delivering higher-quality estimation by sampling from cloud-free distributions, compared to earlier methods. However, diffusion models initiate sampling from pure Gaussian noise, which complicates the sampling trajectory and results in suboptimal performance. Also, current methods fall short in effectively fusing SAR and optical data. To address these limitations, we propose Diffusion Bridges for Cloud Removal, DB-CR, which directly bridges between the cloudy and cloud-free image distributions. In addition, we propose a novel multimodal diffusion bridge architecture with a two-branch backbone for multimodal image restoration, incorporating an efficient backbone and dedicated cross-modality fusion blocks to effectively extract and fuse features from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images. By formulating cloud removal as a diffusion-bridge problem and leveraging this tailored architecture, DB-CR achieves high-fidelity results while being computationally efficient. We evaluated DB-CR on the SEN12MS-CR cloud-removal dataset, demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art results.

- **[HumanDreamer-X: Photorealistic Single-image Human Avatars Reconstruction via Gaussian Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03536)**  `arXiv:2504.03536`  `cs.CV`  
  _Boyuan Wang, Runqi Ouyang, Xiaofeng Wang, Zheng Zhu, Guosheng Zhao, Chaojun Ni, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Single-image human reconstruction is vital for digital human modeling applications but remains an extremely challenging task. Current approaches rely on generative models to synthesize multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction and animation. However, directly generating multiple views from a single human image suffers from geometric inconsistencies, resulting in issues like fragmented or blurred limbs in the reconstructed models. To tackle these limitations, we introduce \textbf{HumanDreamer-X}, a novel framework that integrates multi-view human generation and reconstruction into a unified pipeline, which significantly enhances the geometric consistency and visual fidelity of the reconstructed 3D models. In this framework, 3D Gaussian Splatting serves as an explicit 3D representation to provide initial geometry and appearance priority. Building upon this foundation, \textbf{HumanFixer} is trained to restore 3DGS renderings, which guarantee photorealistic results. Furthermore, we delve into the inherent challenges associated with attention mechanisms in multi-view human generation, and propose an attention modulation strategy that effectively enhances geometric details identity consistency across multi-view. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach markedly improves generation and reconstruction PSNR quality metrics by 16.45% and 12.65%, respectively, achieving a PSNR of up to 25.62 dB, while also showing generalization capabilities on in-the-wild data and applicability to various human reconstruction backbone models.

- **[Detection Based Part-level Articulated Object Reconstruction from Single RGBD Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03177)**  `arXiv:2504.03177`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yuki Kawana, Tatsuya Harada_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose an end-to-end trainable, cross-category method for reconstructing multiple man-made articulated objects from a single RGBD image, focusing on part-level shape reconstruction and pose and kinematics estimation. We depart from previous works that rely on learning instance-level latent space, focusing on man-made articulated objects with predefined part counts. Instead, we propose a novel alternative approach that employs part-level representation, representing instances as combinations of detected parts. While our detect-then-group approach effectively handles instances with diverse part structures and various part counts, it faces issues of false positives, varying part sizes and scales, and an increasing model size due to end-to-end training. To address these challenges, we propose 1) test-time kinematics-aware part fusion to improve detection performance while suppressing false positives, 2) anisotropic scale normalization for part shape learning to accommodate various part sizes and scales, and 3) a balancing strategy for cross-refinement between feature space and output space to improve part detection while maintaining model size. Evaluation on both synthetic and real data demonstrates that our method successfully reconstructs variously structured multiple instances that previous works cannot handle, and outperforms prior works in shape reconstruction and kinematics estimation.

- **[FRESA: Feedforward Reconstruction of Personalized Skinned Avatars from Few Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19207)**  `arXiv:2503.19207`  `cs.CV`  
  _Rong Wang, Fabian Prada, Ziyan Wang, Zhongshi Jiang, Chengxiang Yin, Junxuan Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel method for reconstructing personalized 3D human avatars with realistic animation from only a few images. Due to the large variations in body shapes, poses, and cloth types, existing methods mostly require hours of per-subject optimization during inference, which limits their practical applications. In contrast, we learn a universal prior from over a thousand clothed humans to achieve instant feedforward generation and zero-shot generalization. Specifically, instead of rigging the avatar with shared skinning weights, we jointly infer personalized avatar shape, skinning weights, and pose-dependent deformations, which effectively improves overall geometric fidelity and reduces deformation artifacts. Moreover, to normalize pose variations and resolve coupled ambiguity between canonical shapes and skinning weights, we design a 3D canonicalization process to produce pixel-aligned initial conditions, which helps to reconstruct fine-grained geometric details. We then propose a multi-frame feature aggregation to robustly reduce artifacts introduced in canonicalization and fuse a plausible avatar preserving person-specific identities. Finally, we train the model in an end-to-end framework on a large-scale capture dataset, which contains diverse human subjects paired with high-quality 3D scans. Extensive experiments show that our method generates more authentic reconstruction and animation than state-of-the-arts, and can be directly generalized to inputs from casually taken phone photos.

- **[3D Gaussian Splatting against Moving Objects for High-Fidelity Street Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12001)**  `arXiv:2503.12001`  `cs.CV`  
  _Peizhen Zheng, Longfei Wei, Dongjing Jiang, Jianfei Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The accurate reconstruction of dynamic street scenes is critical for applications in autonomous driving, augmented reality, and virtual reality. Traditional methods relying on dense point clouds and triangular meshes struggle with moving objects, occlusions, and real-time processing constraints, limiting their effectiveness in complex urban environments. While multi-view stereo and neural radiance fields have advanced 3D reconstruction, they face challenges in computational efficiency and handling scene dynamics. This paper proposes a novel 3D Gaussian point distribution method for dynamic street scene reconstruction. Our approach introduces an adaptive transparency mechanism that eliminates moving objects while preserving high-fidelity static scene details. Additionally, iterative refinement of Gaussian point distribution enhances geometric accuracy and texture representation. We integrate directional encoding with spatial position optimization to optimize storage and rendering efficiency, reducing redundancy while maintaining scene integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high reconstruction quality, improved rendering performance, and adaptability in large-scale dynamic environments. These contributions establish a robust framework for real-time, high-precision 3D reconstruction, advancing the practicality of dynamic scene modeling across multiple applications.

- **[LAM: Large Avatar Model for One-shot Animatable Gaussian Head](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17796)**  `arXiv:2502.17796`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yisheng He, Xiaodong Gu, Xiaodan Ye, Chao Xu, Zhengyi Zhao, Yuan Dong, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present LAM, an innovative Large Avatar Model for animatable Gaussian head reconstruction from a single image. Unlike previous methods that require extensive training on captured video sequences or rely on auxiliary neural networks for animation and rendering during inference, our approach generates Gaussian heads that are immediately animatable and renderable. Specifically, LAM creates an animatable Gaussian head in a single forward pass, enabling reenactment and rendering without additional networks or post-processing steps. This capability allows for seamless integration into existing rendering pipelines, ensuring real-time animation and rendering across a wide range of platforms, including mobile phones. The centerpiece of our framework is the canonical Gaussian attributes generator, which utilizes FLAME canonical points as queries. These points interact with multi-scale image features through a Transformer to accurately predict Gaussian attributes in the canonical space. The reconstructed canonical Gaussian avatar can then be animated utilizing standard linear blend skinning (LBS) with corrective blendshapes as the FLAME model did and rendered in real-time on various platforms. Our experimental results demonstrate that LAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on existing benchmarks. Our code and video are available atthis https URL

- **[ResGS: Residual Densification of 3D Gaussian for Efficient Detail Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07494)**  `arXiv:2412.07494`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yanzhe Lyu, Kai Cheng, Xin Kang, Xuejin Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has prevailed in novel view synthesis, achieving high fidelity and efficiency. However, it often struggles to capture rich details and complete geometry. Our analysis reveals that the 3D-GS densification operation lacks adaptiveness and faces a dilemma between geometry coverage and detail recovery. To address this, we introduce a novel densification operation, residual split, which adds a downscaled Gaussian as a residual. Our approach is capable of adaptively retrieving details and complementing missing geometry. To further support this method, we propose a pipeline named ResGS. Specifically, we integrate a Gaussian image pyramid for progressive supervision and implement a selection scheme that prioritizes the densification of coarse Gaussians over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA rendering quality. Consistent performance improvements can be achieved by applying our residual split on various 3D-GS variants, underscoring its versatility and potential for broader application in 3D-GS-based applications.

- **[Noise Augmented Fine Tuning for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03302)**  `arXiv:2504.03302`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Afshin Khadangi, Amir Sartipi, Igor Tchappi, Ramin Bahmani_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often produce inaccurate or misleading content-hallucinations. To address this challenge, we introduce Noise-Augmented Fine-Tuning (NoiseFiT), a novel framework that leverages adaptive noise injection based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to enhance model robustness. In particular, NoiseFiT selectively perturbs layers identified as either high-SNR (more robust) or low-SNR (potentially under-regularized) using a dynamically scaled Gaussian noise. We further propose a hybrid loss that combines standard cross-entropy, soft cross-entropy, and consistency regularization to ensure stable and accurate outputs under noisy training conditions. Our theoretical analysis shows that adaptive noise injection is both unbiased and variance-preserving, providing strong guarantees for convergence in expectation. Empirical results on multiple test and benchmark datasets demonstrate that NoiseFiT significantly reduces hallucination rates, often improving or matching baseline performance in key tasks. These findings highlight the promise of noise-driven strategies for achieving robust, trustworthy language modeling without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Given the comprehensive and detailed nature of our experiments, we have publicly released the fine-tuning logs, benchmark evaluation artifacts, and source code online at W&B, Hugging Face, and GitHub, respectively, to foster further research, accessibility and reproducibility.
