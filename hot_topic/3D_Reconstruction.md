- **[SAND: One-Shot Feature Selection with Additive Noise Distortion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03923)**  `arXiv:2505.03923`  `cs.LG`

  Feature selection is a critical step in data-driven applications, reducing input dimensionality to enhance learning accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Existing state-of-the-art methods often require post-selection retraining and extensive hyperparameter tuning, complicating their adoption. We introduce a novel, non-intrusive feature selection layer that, given a target feature count $k$, automatically identifies and selects the $k$ most informative features during neural network training. Our method is uniquely simple, requiring no alterations to the loss function, network architecture, or post-selection retraining. The layer is mathematically elegant and can be fully described by: \begin{align} \nonumber \tilde{x}_i = a_i x_i + (1-a_i)z_i \end{align} where $x_i$ is the input feature, $\tilde{x}_i$ the output, $z_i$ a Gaussian noise, and $a_i$ trainable gain such that $\sum_i{a_i^2}=k$. This formulation induces an automatic clustering effect, driving $k$ of the $a_i$ gains to $1$ (selecting informative features) and the rest to $0$ (discarding redundant ones) via weighted noise distortion and gain normalization. Despite its extreme simplicity, our method delivers state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark datasets and a novel real-world dataset, outperforming or matching existing approaches without requiring hyperparameter search for $k$ or retraining. Theoretical analysis in the context of linear regression further validates its efficacy. Our work demonstrates that simplicity and performance are not mutually exclusive, offering a powerful yet straightforward tool for feature selection in machine learning.

- **[Foldable SuperNets: Scalable Merging of Transformers with Different Initializations and Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01483)**  `arXiv:2410.01483`  `cs.LG`  
  _Edan Kinderman, Itay Hubara, Haggai Maron, Daniel Soudry_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent methods aim to merge neural networks (NNs) with identical architectures trained on different tasks into a single multi-task model. While most works focus on the simpler setup of merging NNs initialized from a common pre-trained network, we target the harder problem of merging large transformers trained on different tasks from distinct initializations. We show that traditional merging methods fail catastrophically in this setup, while Knowledge Distillation (KD) achieves much better results, though at a higher cost. However, KD is data-inefficient, as it does not exploit the original models' weights. To solve this, we introduce "Foldable SuperNet Merge" (FS-Merge), which trains a SuperNet containing the original models (with frozen weights) using a feature reconstruction objective. After training, the SuperNet is folded back to the size of a single original model. FS-Merge is simple, data-efficient, has a computational cost comparable to KD, and is proven to have superior expressiveness compared to traditional merging methods on MLP models. It achieves SOTA results when tested on MLPs and transformers across various sizes, tasks, modalities, and distribution shifts, especially in low-data scenarios.

- **[G-CUT3R: Guided 3D Reconstruction with Camera and Depth Prior Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11379)**  `arXiv:2508.11379`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Ramil Khafizov, Artem Komarichev, Ruslan Rakhimov, Peter Wonka, Evgeny Burnaev_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce G-CUT3R, a novel feed-forward approach for guided 3D scene reconstruction that enhances the CUT3R model by integrating prior information. Unlike existing feed-forward methods that rely solely on input images, our method leverages auxiliary data, such as depth, camera calibrations, or camera positions, commonly available in real-world scenarios. We propose a lightweight modification to CUT3R, incorporating a dedicated encoder for each modality to extract features, which are fused with RGB image tokens via zero convolution. This flexible design enables seamless integration of any combination of prior information during inference. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including 3D reconstruction and other multi-view tasks, our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements, showing its ability to effectively utilize available priors while maintaining compatibility with varying input modalities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving methods, such as blurring or encryption, are often insufficient due to creating an undesirable trade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction attacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this challenge, we propose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into privacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image transmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic accuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of replay attacks to just 9.4\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously generating richer textual content than baseline methods. Our work provides a practical and scalable solution for building trustworthy AI systems in privacy-sensitive domains, paving the way for more secure smart city and autonomous vehicle networks.

- **[Remove360: Benchmarking Residuals After Object Removal in 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11431)**  `arXiv:2508.11431`  `cs.CV`  
  _Simona Kocour, Assia Benbihi, Torsten Sattler_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding what semantic information persists after object removal is critical for privacy-preserving 3D reconstruction and editable scene representations. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark and evaluation framework to measure semantic residuals, the unintended semantic traces left behind, after object removal in 3D Gaussian Splatting. We conduct experiments across a diverse set of indoor and outdoor scenes, showing that current methods can preserve semantic information despite the absence of visual geometry. We also release Remove360, a dataset of pre/post-removal RGB images and object-level masks captured in real-world environments. While prior datasets have focused on isolated object instances, Remove360 covers a broader and more complex range of indoor and outdoor scenes, enabling evaluation of object removal in the context of full-scene representations. Given ground truth images of a scene before and after object removal, we assess whether we can truly eliminate semantic presence, and if downstream models can still infer what was removed. Our findings reveal critical limitations in current 3D object removal techniques and underscore the need for more robust solutions capable of handling real-world complexity. The evaluation framework is available atthis http URL. Data are available atthis http URL.

- **[Noise Matters: Optimizing Matching Noise for Diffusion Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11330)**  `arXiv:2508.11330`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yanghao Wang, Long Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image classification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious bias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising effects with different category conditions to classify categories. Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles, we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good) noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of NoOp.

- **[Denoise-then-Retrieve: Text-Conditioned Video Denoising for Video Moment Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11313)**  `arXiv:2508.11313`  `cs.CV`  
  _Weijia Liu, Jiuxin Cao, Bo Miao, Zhiheng Fu, Xuelin Zhu, Jiawei Ge, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current text-driven Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methods encode all video clips, including irrelevant ones, disrupting multimodal alignment and hindering optimization. To this end, we propose a denoise-then-retrieve paradigm that explicitly filters text-irrelevant clips from videos and then retrieves the target moment using purified multimodal representations. Following this paradigm, we introduce the Denoise-then-Retrieve Network (DRNet), comprising Text-Conditioned Denoising (TCD) and Text-Reconstruction Feedback (TRF) modules. TCD integrates cross-attention and structured state space blocks to dynamically identify noisy clips and produce a noise mask to purify multimodal video representations. TRF further distills a single query embedding from purified video representations and aligns it with the text embedding, serving as auxiliary supervision for denoising during training. Finally, we perform conditional retrieval using text embeddings on purified video representations for accurate VMR. Experiments on Charades-STA and QVHighlights demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on all metrics. Furthermore, our denoise-then-retrieve paradigm is adaptable and can be seamlessly integrated into advanced VMR models to boost performance.

  With the advancement of generative models, facial image editing has made significant progress. However, achieving fine-grained age editing while preserving personal identity remains a challengingthis http URLthis paper, we propose TimeMachine, a novel diffusion-based framework that achieves accurate age editing while keeping identity features unchanged. To enable fine-grained age editing, we inject high-precision age information into the multi-cross attention module, which explicitly separates age-related and identity-related features. This design facilitates more accurate disentanglement of age attributes, thereby allowing precise and controllable manipulation of facialthis http URL, we propose an Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module that predicts age directly in the latent space, instead of performing denoising image reconstruction during training. By employing a lightweight module to incorporate age constraints, this design enhances age editing accuracy by modest increasing training cost. Additionally, to address the lack of large-scale, high-quality facial age datasets, we construct a HFFA dataset (High-quality Fine-grained Facial-Age dataset) which contains one million high-resolution images labeled with identity and facial attributes. Experimental results demonstrate that TimeMachine achieves state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained age editing while preserving identity consistency.

- **[Unifying Scale-Aware Depth Prediction and Perceptual Priors for Monocular Endoscope Pose Estimation and Tissue Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11282)**  `arXiv:2508.11282`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate endoscope pose estimation and 3D tissue surface reconstruction significantly enhances monocular minimally invasive surgical procedures by enabling accurate navigation and improved spatial awareness. However, monocular endoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges, including depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent endoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To overcome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue reconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with temporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework incorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust initialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in conjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth estimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel correspondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on LPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from physiological tissue deformation and motion. To ensure accurate registration of the synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module is integrated, optimising both rotation and translation. Finally, truncated signed distance function-based volumetric fusion and marching cubes are applied to extract a comprehensive 3D surface mesh. Evaluations on HEVD and SCARED, with ablation and comparative analyses, demonstrate the framework's robustness and superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

- **[Reverse Convolution and Its Applications to Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09824)**  `arXiv:2508.09824`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Convolution and transposed convolution are fundamental operators widely used in neural networks. However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization, 1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures, leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and applications.

- **[SVG-Head: Hybrid Surface-Volumetric Gaussians for High-Fidelity Head Reconstruction and Real-Time Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09597)**  `arXiv:2508.09597`  `cs.CV`

  Creating high-fidelity and editable head avatars is a pivotal challenge in computer vision and graphics, boosting many AR/VR applications. While recent advancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation, head editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due to the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and global appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head Avatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the geometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled texture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two types of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance of head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture editing, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of non-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence between 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping method, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp texture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization strategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both reconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble dataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results, but also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian head avatars and support real-time appearance editing.

  Gaussian splatting has gained attention for its efficient representation and rendering of 3D scenes using continuous Gaussian primitives. However, it struggles with sparse-view inputs due to limited geometric and photometric information, causing ambiguities in depth, shape, and texture.we propose GBR: Generative Bundle Refinement, a method for high-fidelity Gaussian splatting and meshing using only 4-6 input views. GBR integrates a neural bundle adjustment module to enhance geometry accuracy and a generative depth refinement module to improve geometry fidelity. More specifically, the neural bundle adjustment module integrates a foundation network to produce initial 3D point maps and point matches from unposed images, followed by bundle adjustment optimization to improve multiview consistency and point cloud accuracy. The generative depth refinement module employs a diffusion-based strategy to enhance geometric details and fidelity while preserving the scale. Finally, for Gaussian splatting optimization, we propose a multimodal loss function incorporating depth and normal consistency, geometric regularization, and pseudo-view supervision, providing robust guidance under sparse-view conditions. Experiments on widely used datasets show that GBR significantly outperforms existing methods under sparse-view inputs. Additionally, GBR demonstrates the ability to reconstruct and render large-scale real-world scenes, such as the Pavilion of Prince Teng and the Great Wall, with remarkable details using only 6 views.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Monitoring space objects is crucial for space situational awareness, yet reconstructing 3D satellite models from ground-based telescope images is challenging due to atmospheric turbulence, long observation distances, limited viewpoints, and low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we propose a novel computational imaging framework that overcomes these obstacles by integrating a hybrid image pre-processing pipeline with a joint pose estimation and 3D reconstruction module based on controlled Gaussian Splatting (GS) and Branch-and-Bound (BnB) search. We validate our approach on both synthetic satellite datasets and on-sky observations of China's Tiangong Space Station and the International Space Station, achieving robust 3D reconstructions of low-Earth orbit satellites from ground-based data. Quantitative evaluations using SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and Chamfer Distance demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF-based approaches, and ablation studies confirm the critical role of each component. Our framework enables high-fidelity 3D satellite monitoring from Earth, offering a cost-effective alternative for space situational awareness. Project page:this https URL

- **[Scanpath Prediction in Panoramic Videos via Expected Code Length Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02536)**  `arXiv:2305.02536`  `cs.CV`  
  _Mu Li, Kanglong Fan, Kede Ma_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predicting human scanpaths when exploring panoramic videos is a challenging task due to the spherical geometry and the multimodality of the input, and the inherent uncertainty and diversity of the output. Most previous methods fail to give a complete treatment of these characteristics, and thus are prone to errors. In this paper, we present a simple new criterion for scanpath prediction based on principles from lossy data compression. This criterion suggests minimizing the expected code length of quantized scanpaths in a training set, which corresponds to fitting a discrete conditional probability model via maximum likelihood. Specifically, the probability model is conditioned on two modalities: a viewport sequence as the deformation-reduced visual input and a set of relative historical scanpaths projected onto respective viewports as the aligned path input. The probability model is parameterized by a product of discretized Gaussian mixture models to capture the uncertainty and the diversity of scanpaths from different users. Most importantly, the training of the probability model does not rely on the specification of "ground-truth" scanpaths for imitation learning. We also introduce a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller-based sampler to generate realistic human-like scanpaths from the learned probability model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently produces better quantitative scanpath results in terms of prediction accuracy (by comparing to the assumed "ground-truths") and perceptual realism (through machine discrimination) over a wide range of prediction horizons. We additionally verify the perceptual realism improvement via a formal psychophysical experiment and the generalization improvement on several unseen panoramic video datasets.

- **[Personalized Distractor Generation via MCTS-Guided Reasoning Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11184)**  `arXiv:2508.11184`  `cs.CL`  
  _Tao Wu, Jingyuan Chen, Wang Lin, Jian Zhan, Mengze Li, Kun Kuang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Distractors, incorrect but plausible answer choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs), play a critical role in educational assessment by diagnosing student misconceptions. Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to generate shared, group-level distractors by learning common error patterns across large student populations. However, such distractors often fail to capture the diverse reasoning errors of individual students, limiting their diagnostic effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of personalized distractor generation, which aims to generate tailored distractors based on individual misconceptions inferred from each student's past question-answering (QA) records, ensuring every student receives options that effectively exposes their specific reasoning errors. While promising, this task is challenging because each student typically has only a few QA records, which often lack the student's underlying reasoning processes, making training-based group-level approaches infeasible. To overcome this, we propose a training-free two-stage framework. In the first stage, we construct a student-specific misconception prototype by applying Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to recover the student's reasoning trajectories from past incorrect answers. In the second stage, this prototype guides the simulation of the student's reasoning on new questions, enabling the generation of personalized distractors that align with the student's recurring misconceptions. Experiments show that our approach achieves the best performance in generating plausible, personalized distractors for 140 students, and also effectively generalizes to group-level settings, highlighting its robustness and adaptability.
