- **[HI-SLAM2: Geometry-Aware Gaussian SLAM for Fast Monocular Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17982)**  `arXiv:2411.17982`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present HI-SLAM2, a geometry-aware Gaussian SLAM system that achieves fast and accurate monocular scene reconstruction using only RGB input. Existing Neural SLAM or 3DGS-based SLAM methods often trade off between rendering quality and geometry accuracy, our research demonstrates that both can be achieved simultaneously with RGB input alone. The key idea of our approach is to enhance the ability for geometry estimation by combining easy-to-obtain monocular priors with learning-based dense SLAM, and then using 3D Gaussian splatting as our core map representation to efficiently model the scene. Upon loop closure, our method ensures on-the-fly global consistency through efficient pose graph bundle adjustment and instant map updates by explicitly deforming the 3D Gaussian units based on anchored keyframe updates. Furthermore, we introduce a grid-based scale alignment strategy to maintain improved scale consistency in prior depths for finer depth details. Through extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet, and ScanNet++, we demonstrate significant improvements over existing Neural SLAM methods and even surpass RGB-D-based methods in both reconstruction and rendering quality.

- **[PRISM-DP: Spatial Pose-based Observations for Diffusion-Policies via Segmentation, Mesh Generation, and Pose Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20359)**  `arXiv:2504.20359`  `cs.RO`  
  _Xiatao Sun, Yinxing Chen, Daniel Rakita_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based visuomotor policies generate robot motions by learning to denoise action-space trajectories conditioned on observations. These observations are commonly streams of RGB images, whose high dimensionality includes substantial task-irrelevant information, requiring large models to extract relevant patterns. In contrast, using more structured observations, such as the spatial poses (positions and orientations) of key objects over time, enables training more compact policies that can recognize relevant patterns with fewer parameters. However, obtaining accurate object poses in open-set, real-world environments remains challenging. For instance, it is impractical to assume that all relevant objects are equipped with markers, and recent learning-based 6D pose estimation and tracking methods often depend on pre-scanned object meshes, requiring manual reconstruction. In this work, we propose PRISM-DP, an approach that leverages segmentation, mesh generation, pose estimation, and pose tracking models to enable compact diffusion policy learning directly from the spatial poses of task-relevant objects. Crucially, because PRISM-DP uses a mesh generation model, it eliminates the need for manual mesh processing or creation, improving scalability and usability in open-set, real-world environments. Experiments across a range of tasks in both simulation and real-world settings show that PRISM-DP outperforms high-dimensional image-based diffusion policies and achieves performance comparable to policies trained with ground-truth state information. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications and limitations of our approach.

- **[Perturbation-efficient Zeroth-order Optimization for Hardware-friendly On-device Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20314)**  `arXiv:2504.20314`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Qitao Tan, Sung-En Chang, Rui Xia, Huidong Ji, Chence Yang, Ci Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization is an emerging deep neural network (DNN) training paradigm that offers computational simplicity and memory savings. However, this seemingly promising approach faces a significant and long-ignored challenge. ZO requires generating a substantial number of Gaussian random numbers, which poses significant difficulties and even makes it infeasible for hardware platforms, such as FPGAs and ASICs. In this paper, we identify this critical issue, which arises from the mismatch between algorithm and hardware designers. To address this issue, we proposed PeZO, a perturbation-efficient ZO framework. Specifically, we design random number reuse strategies to significantly reduce the demand for random number generation and introduce a hardware-friendly adaptive scaling method to replace the costly Gaussian distribution with a uniform distribution. Our experiments show that PeZO reduces the required LUTs and FFs for random number generation by 48.6\% and 12.7\%, and saves at maximum 86\% power consumption, all without compromising training performance, making ZO optimization feasible for on-device training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the potential of on-device ZO optimization, providing valuable insights for future research.

- **[ProFi-Net: Prototype-based Feature Attention with Curriculum Augmentation for WiFi-based Gesture Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20193)**  `arXiv:2504.20193`  `cs.LG`  
  _Zhe Cui, Shuxian Zhang, Kangzhi Lou, Le-Nam Tran_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents ProFi-Net, a novel few-shot learning framework for WiFi-based gesture recognition that overcomes the chal- lenges of limited training data and sparse feature representations. ProFi- Net employs a prototype-based metric learning architecture enhanced with a feature-level attention mechanism, which dynamically refines the Euclidean distance by emphasizing the most discriminative feature di- mensions. Additionally, our approach introduces a curriculum-inspired data augmentation strategy exclusively on the query set. By progressively incorporating Gaussian noise of increasing magnitude, the model is ex- posed to a broader range of challenging variations, thereby improving its generalization and robustness to overfitting. Extensive experiments con- ducted across diverse real-world environments demonstrate that ProFi- Net significantly outperforms conventional prototype networks and other state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods in terms of classification ac- curacy and training efficiency.

- **[Attention to Detail: Fine-Scale Feature Preservation-Oriented Geometric Pre-training for AI-Driven Surrogate Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20110)**  `arXiv:2504.20110`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI-driven surrogate modeling has become an increasingly effective alternative to physics-based simulations for 3D design, analysis, and manufacturing. These models leverage data-driven methods to predict physical quantities traditionally requiring computationally expensive simulations. However, the scarcity of labeled CAD-to-simulation datasets has driven recent advancements in self-supervised and foundation models, where geometric representation learning is performed offline and later fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. While these approaches have shown promise, their effectiveness is limited in applications requiring fine-scale geometric detail preservation. This work introduces a self-supervised geometric representation learning method designed to capture fine-scale geometric features from non-parametric 3D models. Unlike traditional end-to-end surrogate models, this approach decouples geometric feature extraction from downstream physics tasks, learning a latent space embedding guided by geometric reconstruction losses. Key elements include the essential use of near-zero level sampling and the innovative batch-adaptive attention-weighted loss function, which enhance the encoding of intricate design features. The proposed method is validated through case studies in structural mechanics, demonstrating strong performance in capturing design features and enabling accurate few-shot physics predictions. Comparisons with traditional parametric surrogate modeling highlight its potential to bridge the gap between geometric and physics-based representations, providing an effective solution for surrogate modeling in data-scarce scenarios.

- **[Autoencoder Models for Point Cloud Environmental Synthesis from WiFi Channel State Information: A Preliminary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20541)**  `arXiv:2504.20541`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Daniele Pannone, Danilo Avola_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces a deep learning framework for generating point clouds from WiFi Channel State Information data. We employ a two-stage autoencoder approach: a PointNet autoencoder with convolutional layers for point cloud generation, and a Convolutional Neural Network autoencoder to map CSI data to a matching latent space. By aligning these latent spaces, our method enables accurate environmental point cloud reconstruction from WiFi data. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential for wireless sensing and environmental mapping applications.

- **[GaussTrap: Stealthy Poisoning Attacks on 3D Gaussian Splatting for Targeted Scene Confusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20829)**  `arXiv:2504.20829`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerges as a breakthrough in scene representation and novel view synthesis, its rapid adoption in safety-critical domains (e.g., autonomous systems, AR/VR) urgently demands scrutiny of potential security vulnerabilities. This paper presents the first systematic study of backdoor threats in 3DGS pipelines. We identify that adversaries may implant backdoor views to induce malicious scene confusion during inference, potentially leading to environmental misperception in autonomous navigation or spatial distortion in immersive environments. To uncover this risk, we propose GuassTrap, a novel poisoning attack method targeting 3DGS models. GuassTrap injects malicious views at specific attack viewpoints while preserving high-quality rendering in non-target views, ensuring minimal detectability and maximizing potential harm. Specifically, the proposed method consists of a three-stage pipeline (attack, stabilization, and normal training) to implant stealthy, viewpoint-consistent poisoned renderings in 3DGS, jointly optimizing attack efficacy and perceptual realism to expose security risks in 3D rendering. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that GuassTrap can effectively embed imperceptible yet harmful backdoor views while maintaining high-quality rendering in normal views, validating its robustness, adaptability, and practical applicability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate and robust 3D scene reconstruction from casual, in-the-wild videos can significantly simplify robot deployment to new environments. However, reliable camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction from such unconstrained videos remains an open challenge. Existing visual-only SLAM methods perform well on benchmark datasets but struggle with real-world footage which often exhibits uncontrolled motion including rapid rotations and pure forward movements, textureless regions, and dynamic objects. We analyze the limitations of current methods and introduce a robust pipeline designed to improve 3D reconstruction from casual videos. We build upon recent deep visual odometry methods but increase robustness in several ways. Camera intrinsics are automatically recovered from the first few frames using structure-from-motion. Dynamic objects and less-constrained areas are masked with a predictive model. Additionally, we leverage monocular depth estimates to regularize bundle adjustment, mitigating errors in low-parallax situations. Finally, we integrate place recognition and loop closure to reduce long-term drift and refine both intrinsics and pose estimates through global bundle adjustment. We demonstrate large-scale contiguous 3D models from several online videos in various environments. In contrast, baseline methods typically produce locally inconsistent results at several points, producing separate segments or distorted maps. In lieu of ground-truth pose data, we evaluate map consistency, execution time and visual accuracy of re-rendered NeRF models. Our proposed system establishes a new baseline for visual reconstruction from casual uncontrolled videos found online, demonstrating more consistent reconstructions over longer sequences of in-the-wild videos than previously achieved.

- **[FreBIS: Frequency-Based Stratification for Neural Implicit Surface Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20222)**  `arXiv:2504.20222`  `cs.CV`  
  _Naoko Sawada, Pedro Miraldo, Suhas Lohit, Tim K. Marks, Moitreya Chatterjee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural implicit surface representation techniques are in high demand for advancing technologies in augmented reality/virtual reality, digital twins, autonomous navigation, and many other fields. With their ability to model object surfaces in a scene as a continuous function, such techniques have made remarkable strides recently, especially over classical 3D surface reconstruction methods, such as those that use voxels or point clouds. However, these methods struggle with scenes that have varied and complex surfaces principally because they model any given scene with a single encoder network that is tasked to capture all of low through high-surface frequency information in the scene simultaneously. In this work, we propose a novel, neural implicit surface representation approach called FreBIS to overcome this challenge. FreBIS works by stratifying the scene based on the frequency of surfaces into multiple frequency levels, with each level (or a group of levels) encoded by a dedicated encoder. Moreover, FreBIS encourages these encoders to capture complementary information by promoting mutual dissimilarity of the encoded features via a novel, redundancy-aware weighting module. Empirical evaluations on the challenging BlendedMVS dataset indicate that replacing the standard encoder in an off-the-shelf neural surface reconstruction method with our frequency-stratified encoders yields significant improvements. These enhancements are evident both in the quality of the reconstructed 3D surfaces and in the fidelity of their renderings from any viewpoint.

- **[Forging and Removing Latent-Noise Diffusion Watermarks Using a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20111)**  `arXiv:2504.20111`  `cs.CV`  
  _Anubhav Jain, Yuya Kobayashi, Naoki Murata, Yuhta Takida, Takashi Shibuya, Yuki Mitsufuji, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Watermarking techniques are vital for protecting intellectual property and preventing fraudulent use of media. Most previous watermarking schemes designed for diffusion models embed a secret key in the initial noise. The resulting pattern is often considered hard to remove and forge into unrelated images. In this paper, we propose a black-box adversarial attack without presuming access to the diffusion model weights. Our attack uses only a single watermarked example and is based on a simple observation: there is a many-to-one mapping between images and initial noises. There are regions in the clean image latent space pertaining to each watermark that get mapped to the same initial noise when inverted. Based on this intuition, we propose an adversarial attack to forge the watermark by introducing perturbations to the images such that we can enter the region of watermarked images. We show that we can also apply a similar approach for watermark removal by learning perturbations to exit this region. We report results on multiple watermarking schemes (Tree-Ring, RingID, WIND, and Gaussian Shading) across two diffusion models (SDv1.4 and SDv2.0). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack and expose vulnerabilities in the watermarking methods, motivating future research on improving them.

- **[IM-Portrait: Learning 3D-aware Video Diffusion for Photorealistic Talking Heads from Monocular Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19165)**  `arXiv:2504.19165`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yuan Li, Ziqian Bai, Feitong Tan, Zhaopeng Cui, Sean Fanello, Yinda Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel 3D-aware diffusion-based method for generating photorealistic talking head videos directly from a single identity image and explicit control signals (e.g., expressions). Our method generates Multiplane Images (MPIs) that ensure geometric consistency, making them ideal for immersive viewing experiences like binocular videos for VR headsets. Unlike existing methods that often require a separate stage or joint optimization to reconstruct a 3D representation (such as NeRF or 3D Gaussians), our approach directly generates the final output through a single denoising process, eliminating the need for post-processing steps to render novel views efficiently. To effectively learn from monocular videos, we introduce a training mechanism that reconstructs the output MPI randomly in either the target or the reference camera space. This approach enables the model to simultaneously learn sharp image details and underlying 3D information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves competitive avatar quality and novel-view rendering capabilities, even without explicit 3D reconstruction or high-quality multi-view training data.

- **[Confidence Aware Learning for Reliable Face Anti-spoofing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01263)**  `arXiv:2411.01263`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xingming Long, Jie Zhang, Shiguang Shan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current Face Anti-spoofing (FAS) models tend to make overly confident predictions even when encountering unfamiliar scenarios or unknown presentation attacks, which leads to serious potential risks. To solve this problem, we propose a Confidence Aware Face Anti-spoofing (CA-FAS) model, which is aware of its capability boundary, thus achieving reliable liveness detection within this boundary. To enable the CA-FAS to "know what it doesn't know", we propose to estimate its confidence during the prediction of each sample. Specifically, we build Gaussian distributions for both the live faces and the known attacks. The prediction confidence for each sample is subsequently assessed using the Mahalanobis distance between the sample and the Gaussians for the "known data". We further introduce the Mahalanobis distance-based triplet mining to optimize the parameters of both the model and the constructed Gaussians as a whole. Extensive experiments show that the proposed CA-FAS can effectively recognize samples with low prediction confidence and thus achieve much more reliable performance than other FAS models by filtering out samples that are beyond its reliable range.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Radiance fields including NeRFs and 3D Gaussians demonstrate great potential in high-fidelity rendering and scene reconstruction, while they require a substantial number of posed images as inputs. COLMAP is frequently employed for preprocessing to estimate poses, while it necessitates a large number of feature matches to operate effectively, and it struggles with scenes characterized by sparse features, large baselines between images, or a limited number of input images. We aim to tackle few-view NeRF reconstruction using only 3 to 6 unposed scene images. Traditional methods often use calibration boards but they are not common in images. We propose a novel idea of utilizing everyday objects, commonly found in both images and real life, as "pose probes". The probe object is automatically segmented by SAM, whose shape is initialized from a cube. We apply a dual-branch volume rendering optimization (object NeRF and scene NeRF) to constrain the pose optimization and jointly refine the geometry. Specifically, object poses of two views are first estimated by PnP matching in an SDF representation, which serves as initial poses. PnP matching, requiring only a few features, is suitable for feature-sparse scenes. Additional views are incrementally incorporated to refine poses from preceding views. In experiments, PoseProbe achieves state-of-the-art performance in both pose estimation and novel view synthesis across multiple datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness, particularly in few-view and large-baseline scenes where COLMAP struggles. In ablations, using different objects in a scene yields comparable performance.
