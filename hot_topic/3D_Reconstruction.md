  3D Gaussian Splats (3DGSs) are 3D object models derived from multi-view images. Such "digital twins" are useful for simulations, virtual reality, marketing, robot policy fine-tuning, and part inspection. 3D object scanning usually requires multi-camera arrays, precise laser scanners, or robot wrist-mounted cameras, which have restricted workspaces. We propose Omni-Scan, a pipeline for producing high-quality 3D Gaussian Splat models using a bi-manual robot that grasps an object with one gripper and rotates the object with respect to a stationary camera. The object is then re-grasped by a second gripper to expose surfaces that were occluded by the first gripper. We present the Omni-Scan robot pipeline using DepthAny-thing, Segment Anything, as well as RAFT optical flow models to identify and isolate objects held by a robot gripper while removing the gripper and the background. We then modify the 3DGS training pipeline to support concatenated datasets with gripper occlusion, producing an omni-directional (360 degree view) model of the object. We apply Omni-Scan to part defect inspection, finding that it can identify visual or geometric defects in 12 different industrial and household objects with an average accuracy of 83%.

  The rapid iteration of autonomous vehicle (AV) deployments leads to increasing needs for building realistic and scalable multi-agent traffic simulators for efficient evaluation. Recent advances in this area focus on closed-loop simulators that enable generating diverse and interactive scenarios. This paper introduces Neural Interactive Agents (NIVA), a probabilistic framework for multi-agent simulation driven by a hierarchical Bayesian model that enables closed-loop, observation-conditioned simulation through autoregressive sampling from a latent, finite mixture of Gaussian distributions. We demonstrate how NIVA unifies preexisting sequence-to-sequence trajectory prediction models and emerging closed-loop simulation models trained on Next-token Prediction (NTP) from a Bayesian inference perspective. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that NIVA attains competitive performance compared to the existing method while providing embellishing control over intentions and driving styles.

- **[FalconGym: A Photorealistic Simulation Framework for Zero-Shot Sim-to-Real Vision-Based Quadrotor Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02198)**  `arXiv:2503.02198`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yan Miao, Will Shen, Sayan Mitra_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel framework demonstrating zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of visual control policies learned in a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) environment for quadrotors to fly through racing gates. Robust transfer from simulation to real flight poses a major challenge, as standard simulators often lack sufficient visual fidelity. To address this, we construct a photorealistic simulation environment of quadrotor racing tracks, called FalconGym, which provides effectively unlimited synthetic images for training. Within FalconGym, we develop a pipelined approach for crossing gates that combines (i) a Neural Pose Estimator (NPE) coupled with a Kalman filter to reliably infer quadrotor poses from single-frame RGB images and IMU data, and (ii) a self-attention-based multi-modal controller that adaptively integrates visual features and pose estimation. This multi-modal design compensates for perception noise and intermittent gate visibility. We train this controller purely in FalconGym with imitation learning and deploy the resulting policy to real hardware with no additional fine-tuning. Simulation experiments on three distinct tracks (circle, U-turn and figure-8) demonstrate that our controller outperforms a vision-only state-of-the-art baseline in both success rate and gate-crossing accuracy. In 30 live hardware flights spanning three tracks and 120 gates, our controller achieves a 95.8% success rate and an average error of just 10 cm when flying through 38 cm-radius gates.

- **[Flow Matching Policy Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21053)**  `arXiv:2507.21053`  `cs.LG` `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flow-based generative models, including diffusion models, excel at modeling continuous distributions in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we introduce Flow Policy Optimization (FPO), a simple on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that brings flow matching into the policy gradient framework. FPO casts policy optimization as maximizing an advantage-weighted ratio computed from the conditional flow matching loss, in a manner compatible with the popular PPO-clip framework. It sidesteps the need for exact likelihood computation while preserving the generative capabilities of flow-based models. Unlike prior approaches for diffusion-based reinforcement learning that bind training to a specific sampling method, FPO is agnostic to the choice of diffusion or flow integration at both training and inference time. We show that FPO can train diffusion-style policies from scratch in a variety of continuous control tasks. We find that flow-based models can capture multimodal action distributions and achieve higher performance than Gaussian policies, particularly in under-conditioned settings.

- **[Benchmarking Partial Observability in Reinforcement Learning with a Suite of Memory-Improvable Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00046)**  `arXiv:2508.00046`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Ruo Yu Tao, Kaicheng Guo, Cameron Allen, George Konidaris_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mitigating partial observability is a necessary but challenging task for general reinforcement learning algorithms. To improve an algorithm's ability to mitigate partial observability, researchers need comprehensive benchmarks to gauge progress. Most algorithms tackling partial observability are only evaluated on benchmarks with simple forms of state aliasing, such as feature masking and Gaussian noise. Such benchmarks do not represent the many forms of partial observability seen in real domains, like visual occlusion or unknown opponent intent. We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two key properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to ensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the performance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors roughly equal. This gap implies that an environment is memory improvable: where performance gains in a domain are from an algorithm's ability to cope with partial observability as opposed to other factors. We introduce best-practice guidelines for empirically benchmarking reinforcement learning under partial observability, as well as the open-source library POBAX: Partially Observable Benchmarks in JAX. We characterize the types of partial observability present in various environments and select representative environments for our benchmark. These environments include localization and mapping, visual control, games, and more. Additionally, we show that these tasks are all memory improvable and require hard-to-learn memory functions, providing a concrete signal for partial observability research. This framework includes recommended hyperparameters as well as algorithm implementations for fast, out-of-the-box evaluation, as well as highly performant environments implemented in JAX for GPU-scalable experimentation.

- **[Diffusion-Scheduled Denoising Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection in Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00758)**  `arXiv:2508.00758`  `cs.LG`  
  _Timur Sattarov, Marco Schreyer, Damian Borth_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly detection in tabular data remains challenging due to complex feature interactions and the scarcity of anomalous examples. Denoising autoencoders rely on fixed-magnitude noise, limiting adaptability to diverse data distributions. Diffusion models introduce scheduled noise and iterative denoising, but lack explicit reconstruction mappings. We propose the Diffusion-Scheduled Denoising Autoencoder (DDAE), a framework that integrates diffusion-based noise scheduling and contrastive learning into the encoding process to improve anomaly detection. We evaluated DDAE on 57 datasets from ADBench. Our method outperforms in semi-supervised settings and achieves competitive results in unsupervised settings, improving PR-AUC by up to 65% (9%) and ROC-AUC by 16% (6%) over state-of-the-art autoencoder (diffusion) model baselines. We observed that higher noise levels benefit unsupervised training, while lower noise with linear scheduling is optimal in semi-supervised settings. These findings underscore the importance of principled noise strategies in tabular anomaly detection.

  _Chanyoung Yoon, Sangbong Yoo, Soobin Yim, Chansoo Kim, Yun Jang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Designing residential interiors strongly impacts occupant satisfaction but remains challenging due to unstructured spatial layouts, high computational demands, and reliance on expert knowledge. Existing methods based on optimization or deep learning are either computationally expensive or constrained by data scarcity. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often limit furniture placement to discrete positions and fail to incorporate design principles adequately. We propose OID-PPO, a novel RL framework for Optimal Interior Design using Proximal Policy Optimization, which integrates expert-defined functional and visual guidelines into a structured reward function. OID-PPO utilizes a diagonal Gaussian policy for continuous and flexible furniture placement, effectively exploring latent environmental dynamics under partial observability. Experiments conducted across diverse room shapes and furniture configurations demonstrate that OID-PPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of layout quality and computational efficiency. Ablation studies further demonstrate the impact of structured guideline integration and reveal the distinct contributions of individual design constraints.

- **[ECG Latent Feature Extraction with Autoencoders for Downstream Prediction Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00131)**  `arXiv:2508.00131`  `cs.LG`  
  _Christopher Harvey, Sumaiya Shomaji, Zijun Yao, Amit Noheria_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an inexpensive and widely available tool for cardiac assessment. Despite its standardized format and small file size, the high complexity and inter-individual variability of ECG signals (typically a 60,000-size vector with 12 leads at 500 Hz) make it challenging to use in deep learning models, especially when only small training datasets are available. This study addresses these challenges by exploring feature generation methods from representative beat ECGs, focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders to reduce data complexity. We introduce three novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE) variants-Stochastic Autoencoder (SAE), Annealed beta-VAE (A beta-VAE), and Cyclical beta VAE (C beta-VAE)-and compare their effectiveness in maintaining signal fidelity and enhancing downstream prediction tasks using a Light Gradient Boost Machine (LGBM). The A beta-VAE achieved superior signal reconstruction, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) to 15.7+/-3.2 muV, which is at the level of signal noise. Moreover, the SAE encodings, when combined with traditional ECG summary features, improved the prediction of reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), achieving an holdout test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.901 with a LGBM classifier. This performance nearly matches the 0.909 AUROC of state-of-the-art CNN model but requires significantly less computational resources. Further, the ECG feature extraction-LGBM pipeline avoids overfitting and retains predictive performance when trained with less data. Our findings demonstrate that these VAE encodings are not only effective in simplifying ECG data but also provide a practical solution for applying deep learning in contexts with limited-scale labeled training data.

- **[Coflex: Enhancing HW-NAS with Sparse Gaussian Processes for Efficient and Scalable DNN Accelerator Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23437)**  `arXiv:2507.23437`  `cs.LG`  
  _Yinhui Ma, Tomomasa Yamasaki, Zhehui Wang, Tao Luo, Bo Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on accelerator-specific architecture. Our experimental results show that Coflex outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from 1.9x to 9.5x.

- **[Adapting to the Unknown: Robust Meta-Learning for Zero-Shot Financial Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09664)**  `arXiv:2504.09664`  `cs.LG`  
  _Anxian Liu, Junying Ma, Guang Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Financial time series forecasting in zero-shot settings is critical for investment decisions, especially during abrupt market regime shifts or in emerging markets with limited historical data. While Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) approaches show promise, existing meta-task construction strategies often yield suboptimal performance for highly turbulent financial series. To address this, we propose a novel task-construction method that leverages learned embeddings for both meta task and also downstream predictions, enabling effective zero-shot meta-learning. Specifically, we use Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to softly cluster embeddings, constructing two complementary meta-task types: intra-cluster tasks and inter-cluster tasks. By assigning embeddings to multiple latent regimes probabilistically, GMMs enable richer, more diverse meta-learning. This dual approach ensures the model can quickly adapt to local patterns while simultaneously capturing invariant cross-series features. Furthermore, we enhance inter-cluster generalization through hard task mining, which identifies robust patterns across divergent market regimes. Our method was validated using real-world financial data from high-volatility periods and multiple international markets (including emerging markets). The results demonstrate significant out-performance over existing approaches and stronger generalization in zero-shot scenarios.

- **[Sampling from Energy-based Policies using Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01312)**  `arXiv:2410.01312`  `cs.LG`  
  _Vineet Jain, Tara Akhound-Sadegh, Siamak Ravanbakhsh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Energy-based policies offer a flexible framework for modeling complex, multimodal behaviors in reinforcement learning (RL). In maximum entropy RL, the optimal policy is a Boltzmann distribution derived from the soft Q-function, but direct sampling from this distribution in continuous action spaces is computationally intractable. As a result, existing methods typically use simpler parametric distributions, like Gaussians, for policy representation -- limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of multimodal action distributions. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based approach for sampling from energy-based policies, where the negative Q-function defines the energy function. Based on this approach, we propose an actor-critic method called Diffusion Q-Sampling (DQS) that enables more expressive policy representations, allowing stable learning in diverse environments. We show that our approach enhances sample efficiency in continuous control tasks and captures multimodal behaviors, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

- **[IGL-Nav: Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization for Image-goal Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00823)**  `arXiv:2508.00823`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Wenxuan Guo, Xiuwei Xu, Hang Yin, Ziwei Wang, Jianjiang Feng, Jie Zhou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian (3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to capture goal image at arbitrary pose.

- **[Sample-Aware Test-Time Adaptation for Medical Image-to-Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00766)**  `arXiv:2508.00766`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion. However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples, demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios.

- **[Contact-Aware Amodal Completion for Human-Object Interaction via Multi-Regional Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00427)**  `arXiv:2508.00427`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Seunggeun Chi, Enna Sachdeva, Pin-Hao Huang, Kwonjoon Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Amodal completion, which is the process of inferring the full appearance of objects despite partial occlusions, is crucial for understanding complex human-object interactions (HOI) in computer vision and robotics. Existing methods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to generate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited understanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach that uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional inpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints from human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions: the primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the secondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional inpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions within a diffusion model. This improves the accuracy and realism of the generated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in HOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like understanding of dynamic environments. We also show that our pipeline is robust even without ground-truth contact annotations, which broadens its applicability to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis.

- **[DC-AE 1.5: Accelerating Diffusion Model Convergence with Structured Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00413)**  `arXiv:2508.00413`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Junyu Chen, Dongyun Zou, Wenkun He, Junsong Chen, Enze Xie, Song Han, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders for high-resolution diffusion models. Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality. However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling results than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better image generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster. Code:this https URL.

- **[SparseRecon: Neural Implicit Surface Reconstruction from Sparse Views with Feature and Depth Consistencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00366)**  `arXiv:2508.00366`  `cs.CV`  
  _Liang Han, Xu Zhang, Haichuan Song, Kanle Shi, Yu-Shen Liu, Zhizhong Han_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Surface reconstruction from sparse views aims to reconstruct a 3D shape or scene from few RGB images. The latest methods are either generalization-based or overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not generalize well on views that were unseen during training, while the reconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the limited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel neural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint. Firstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the neural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by insufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and smoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an uncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in areas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry details for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce high-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with small overlapping views.

- **[Towards Robust Semantic Correspondence: A Benchmark and Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00272)**  `arXiv:2508.00272`  `cs.CV`  
  _Wenyue Chong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semantic correspondence aims to identify semantically meaningful relationships between different images and is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated. In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14 distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness, but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3) The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and real-world benchmarks.

- **[Guided Depth Map Super-Resolution via Multi-Scale Fusion U-shaped Mamba Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00248)**  `arXiv:2508.00248`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chenggang Guo, Hao Xu, XianMing Wan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Depth map super-resolution technology aims to improve the spatial resolution of low-resolution depth maps and effectively restore high-frequency detail information. Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in dealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global contextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global dependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are quadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution depth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba (MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core innovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling capabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color image. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and the Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature extraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of the state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the model adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the high-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the super-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream methods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model parameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness of the model, especially showing excellent generalization ability in the task of large-scale depth map super-resolution.

  _Ziyue Guo, Xin Yang, Yutao Shen, Yang Zhu, Lixi Jiang, Haiyan Cen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quantitative descriptions of the complete canopy architecture are essential for accurately evaluating crop photosynthesis and yield performance to guide ideotype design. Although various sensing technologies have been developed for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of individual plants and canopies, they failed to obtain an accurate description of canopy architectures due to severe occlusion among complex canopy architectures. We proposed an effective method for 3D reconstruction of complex, dynamic population canopy architecture for rapeseed crops with a novel point cloud completion model. A complete point cloud generation framework was developed for automated annotation of the training dataset by distinguishing surface points from occluded points within canopies. The crop population point cloud completion network (CP-PCN) was then designed with a multi-resolution dynamic graph convolutional encoder (MRDG) and a point pyramid decoder (PPD) to predict occluded points. To further enhance feature extraction, a dynamic graph convolutional feature extractor (DGCFE) module was proposed to capture structural variations over the whole rapeseed growth period. The results demonstrated that CP-PCN achieved chamfer distance (CD) values of 3.35 cm -4.51 cm over four growth stages, outperforming the state-of-the-art transformer-based method (PoinTr). Ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of the MRDG and DGCFE modules. Moreover, the validation experiment demonstrated that the silique efficiency index developed from CP-PCN improved the overall accuracy of rapeseed yield prediction by 11.2% compared to that of using incomplete point clouds. The CP-PCN pipeline has the potential to be extended to other crops, significantly advancing the quantitatively analysis of in-field population canopy architectures.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing a high-quality, animatable 3D human avatar with expressive facial and hand motions from a single image has gained significant attention due to its broad application potential. 3D human avatar reconstruction typically requires multi-view or monocular videos and training on individual IDs, which is both complex and time-consuming. Furthermore, limited by SMPLX's expressiveness, these methods often focus on body motion but struggle with facial expressions. To address these challenges, we first introduce an expressive human model (EHM) to enhance facial expression capabilities and develop an accurate tracking method. Based on this template model, we propose GUAVA, the first framework for fast animatable upper-body 3D Gaussian avatar reconstruction. We leverage inverse texture mapping and projection sampling techniques to infer Ubody (upper-body) Gaussians from a single image. The rendered images are refined through a neural refiner. Experimental results demonstrate that GUAVA significantly outperforms previous methods in rendering quality and offers significant speed improvements, with reconstruction times in the sub-second range (0.1s), and supports real-time animation and rendering.

- **[Multi-Cali Anything: Dense Feature Multi-Frame Structure-from-Motion for Large-Scale Camera Array Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00737)**  `arXiv:2503.00737`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jinjiang You, Hewei Wang, Yijie Li, Mingxiao Huo, Long Van Tran Ha, Mingyuan Ma, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Calibrating large-scale camera arrays, such as those in dome-based setups, is time-intensive and typically requires dedicated captures of known patterns. While extrinsics in such arrays are fixed due to the physical setup, intrinsics often vary across sessions due to factors like lens adjustments or temperature changes. In this paper, we propose a dense-feature-driven multi-frame calibration method that refines intrinsics directly from scene data, eliminating the necessity for additional calibration captures. Our approach enhances traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines by introducing an extrinsics regularization term to progressively align estimated extrinsics with ground-truth values, a dense feature reprojection term to reduce keypoint errors by minimizing reprojection loss in the feature space, and an intrinsics variance term for joint optimization across multiple frames. Experiments on the Multiface dataset show that our method achieves nearly the same precision as dedicated calibration processes, and significantly enhances intrinsics and 3D reconstruction accuracy.

  In this work, we introduce NoiseQuery as a novel method for enhanced noise initialization in versatile goal-driven text-to-image (T2I) generation. Specifically, we propose to leverage an aligned Gaussian noise as implicit guidance to complement explicit user-defined inputs, such as text prompts, for better generation quality and controllability. Unlike existing noise optimization methods designed for specific models, our approach is grounded in a fundamental examination of the generic finite-step noise scheduler design in diffusion formulation, allowing better generalization across different diffusion-based architectures in a tuning-free manner. This model-agnostic nature allows us to construct a reusable noise library compatible with multiple T2I models and enhancement techniques, serving as a foundational layer for more effective generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NoiseQuery enables fine-grained control and yields significant performance boosts not only over high-level semantics but also over low-level visual attributes, which are typically difficult to specify through text alone, with seamless integration into current workflows with minimal computational overhead.

  Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable agents to accurately localize targets and plan flight paths in complex environments based on natural language instructions, with broad applications in intelligent inspection, disaster rescue, and urban monitoring. Recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has provided strong semantic understanding for this task, while reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising post-training strategy to further improve generalization. However, existing RL methods often suffer from inefficient use of training data, slow convergence, and insufficient consideration of the difficulty variation among training samples, which limits further performance improvement. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Semantic-Aware Gaussian Curriculum Scheduling (SA-GCS)}, a novel training framework that systematically integrates Curriculum Learning (CL) into RL. SA-GCS employs a Semantic-Aware Difficulty Estimator (SA-DE) to quantify the complexity of training samples and a Gaussian Curriculum Scheduler (GCS) to dynamically adjust the sampling distribution, enabling a smooth progression from easy to challenging tasks. This design significantly improves training efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances overall model performance. Extensive experiments on the CityNav benchmark demonstrate that SA-GCS consistently outperforms strong baselines across all metrics, achieves faster and more stable convergence, and generalizes well across models of different scales, highlighting its robustness and scalability. The implementation of our approach is publicly available.
