- **[Multi-Component VAE with Gaussian Markov Random Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12165)**  `arXiv:2507.12165`  `cs.LG`

  Multi-component datasets with intricate dependencies, like industrial assemblies or multi-modal imaging, challenge current generative modeling techniques. Existing Multi-component Variational AutoEncoders typically rely on simplified aggregation strategies, neglecting critical nuances and consequently compromising structural coherence across generated components. To explicitly address this gap, we introduce the Gaussian Markov Random Field Multi-Component Variational AutoEncoder , a novel generative framework embedding Gaussian Markov Random Fields into both prior and posterior distributions. This design choice explicitly models cross-component relationships, enabling richer representation and faithful reproduction of complex interactions. Empirically, our GMRF MCVAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on a synthetic Copula dataset specifically constructed to evaluate intricate component relationships, demonstrates competitive results on the PolyMNIST benchmark, and significantly enhances structural coherence on the real-world BIKED dataset. Our results indicate that the GMRF MCVAE is especially suited for practical applications demanding robust and realistic modeling of multi-component coherence

- **[Emergence of Quantised Representations Isolated to Anisotropic Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12070)**  `arXiv:2507.12070`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper describes a novel methodology for determining representational alignment, developed upon the existing Spotlight Resonance method. Using this, it is found that algebraic symmetries of network primitives are a strong predictor for task-agnostic structure in representations. Particularly, this new tool is used to gain insight into how discrete representations can form and arrange in autoencoder models, through an ablation study where only the activation function is altered. Representations are found to tend to discretise when the activation functions are defined through a discrete algebraic permutation-equivariant symmetry. In contrast, they remain continuous under a continuous algebraic orthogonal-equivariant definition. These findings corroborate the hypothesis that functional form choices can carry unintended inductive biases which produce task-independent artefactual structures in representations, particularly that contemporary forms induce discretisation of otherwise continuous structure -- a quantisation effect. Moreover, this supports a general causal model for one mode in which discrete representations may form, and could constitute a prerequisite for downstream interpretability phenomena, including grandmother neurons, discrete coding schemes, general linear features and possibly Superposition. Hence, this tool and proposed mechanism for the influence of functional form on representations may provide several insights into emergent interpretability research. Finally, preliminary results indicate that quantisation of representations appears to correlate with a measurable increase in reconstruction error, reinforcing previous conjectures that this collapse can be detrimental.

- **[Simplifying Graph Kernels for Efficient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03560)**  `arXiv:2507.03560`  `cs.LG`  
  _Lin Wang, Shijie Wang, Sirui Huang, Qing Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While kernel methods and Graph Neural Networks offer complementary strengths, integrating the two has posed challenges in efficiency and scalability. The Graph Neural Tangent Kernel provides a theoretical bridge by interpreting GNNs through the lens of neural tangent kernels. However, its reliance on deep, stacked layers introduces repeated computations that hinder performance. In this work, we introduce a new perspective by designing the simplified graph kernel, which replaces deep layer stacking with a streamlined $K$-step message aggregation process. This formulation avoids iterative layer-wise propagation altogether, leading to a more concise and computationally efficient framework without sacrificing the expressive power needed for graph tasks. Beyond this simplification, we propose another Simplified Graph Kernel, which draws from Gaussian Process theory to model infinite-width GNNs. Rather than simulating network depth, this kernel analytically computes kernel values based on the statistical behavior of nonlinear activations in the infinite limit. This eliminates the need for explicit architecture simulation, further reducing complexity. Our experiments on standard graph and node classification benchmarks show that our methods achieve competitive accuracy while reducing runtime. This makes them practical alternatives for learning on graphs at scale. Full implementation and reproducibility materials are provided at:this https URL.

  _Dipak Dulal, Joseph J. Charney, Michael Gallagher, Carmeliza Navasca, Nicholas Skowronski_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This research project investigated the correlation between a 10 Hz time series of thermocouple temperatures and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) computed from wind speeds collected from a small experimental prescribed burn at the Silas Little Experimental Forest in New Jersey, USA. The primary objective of this project was to explore the potential for using thermocouple temperatures as predictors for estimating the TKE produced by a wildland fire. Machine learning models, including Deep Neural Networks, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting, and Gaussian Process Regressor, are employed to assess the potential for thermocouple temperature perturbations to predict TKE values. Data visualization and correlation analyses reveal patterns and relationships between thermocouple temperatures and TKE, providing insight into the underlying dynamics. The project achieves high accuracy in predicting TKE by employing various machine learning models despite a weak correlation between the predictors and the target variable. The results demonstrate significant success, particularly from regression models, in accurately estimating the TKE. The research findings contribute to fire behavior and smoke modeling science, emphasizing the importance of incorporating machine learning approaches and identifying complex relationships between fine-scale fire behavior and turbulence. Accurate TKE estimation using thermocouple temperatures allows for the refinement of models that can inform decision-making in fire management strategies, facilitate effective risk mitigation, and optimize fire management efforts. This project highlights the valuable role of machine learning techniques in analyzing wildland fire data, showcasing their potential to advance fire research and management practices.

- **[Incremental Joint Learning of Depth, Pose and Implicit Scene Representation on Monocular Camera in Large-scale Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06050)**  `arXiv:2404.06050`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Tianchen Deng, Nailin Wang, Chongdi Wang, Shenghai Yuan, Jingchuan Wang, Hesheng Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dense scene reconstruction for photo-realistic view synthesis has various applications, such as VR/AR, autonomous vehicles. However, most existing methods have difficulties in large-scale scenes due to three core challenges: \textit{(a) inaccurate depth input.} Accurate depth input is impossible to get in real-world large-scale scenes. \textit{(b) inaccurate pose estimation.} Most existing approaches rely on accurate pre-estimated camera poses. \textit{(c) insufficient scene representation capability.} A single global radiance field lacks the capacity to effectively scale to large-scale scenes. To this end, we propose an incremental joint learning framework, which can achieve accurate depth, pose estimation, and large-scale scene reconstruction. A vision transformer-based network is adopted as the backbone to enhance performance in scale information estimation. For pose estimation, a feature-metric bundle adjustment (FBA) method is designed for accurate and robust camera tracking in large-scale scenes. In terms of implicit scene representation, we propose an incremental scene representation method to construct the entire large-scale scene as multiple local radiance fields to enhance the scalability of 3D scene representation. Extended experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method in depth estimation, pose estimation, and large-scale scene reconstruction.

- **[Neural Human Pose Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12138)**  `arXiv:2507.12138`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Michal Heker, Sefy Kararlitsky, David Tolpin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a principled, data-driven approach for modeling a neural prior over human body poses using normalizing flows. Unlike heuristic or low-expressivity alternatives, our method leverages RealNVP to learn a flexible density over poses represented in the 6D rotation format. We address the challenge of modeling distributions on the manifold of valid 6D rotations by inverting the Gram-Schmidt process during training, enabling stable learning while preserving downstream compatibility with rotation-based frameworks. Our architecture and training pipeline are framework-agnostic and easily reproducible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned prior through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and we analyze its impact via ablation studies. This work provides a sound probabilistic foundation for integrating pose priors into human motion capture and reconstruction pipelines.

- **[SketchDNN: Joint Continuous-Discrete Diffusion for CAD Sketch Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11579)**  `arXiv:2507.11579`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Sathvik Chereddy, John Femiani_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present SketchDNN, a generative model for synthesizing CAD sketches that jointly models both continuous parameters and discrete class labels through a unified continuous-discrete diffusion process. Our core innovation is Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation, facilitating blended class labels for discrete variables. This formulation addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches. Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) from 16.04 to 7.80 and negative log-likelihood (NLL) from 84.8 to 81.33, establishing a new state-of-the-art in CAD sketch generation on the SketchGraphs dataset.

- **[TextDestroyer: A Training- and Annotation-Free Diffusion Method for Destroying Anomal Text from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00355)**  `arXiv:2411.00355`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Mengcheng Li, Fei Chao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose TextDestroyer, the first training- and annotation-free method for scene text destruction using a pre-trained diffusion model. Existing scene text removal models require complex annotation and retraining, and may leave faint yet recognizable text information, compromising privacy protection and content concealment. TextDestroyer addresses these issues by employing a three-stage hierarchical process to obtain accurate text masks. Our method scrambles text areas in the latent start code using a Gaussian distribution before reconstruction. During the diffusion denoising process, self-attention key and value are referenced from the original latent to restore the compromised background. Latent codes saved at each inversion step are used for replacement during reconstruction, ensuring perfect background restoration. The advantages of TextDestroyer include: (1) it eliminates labor-intensive data annotation and resource-intensive training; (2) it achieves more thorough text destruction, preventing recognizable traces; and (3) it demonstrates better generalization capabilities, performing well on both real-world scenes and generated images.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern digitised approaches have dramatically changed the preservation and restoration of cultural treasures, integrating computer scientists into multidisciplinary projects with ease. Machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision techniques have revolutionised developing sectors like 3D reconstruction, picture inpainting,IoT-based methods, genetic algorithms, and image processing with the integration of computer scientists into multidisciplinary initiatives. We suggest three cutting-edge techniques in recognition of the special qualities of Indian monuments, which are famous for their architectural skill and aesthetic appeal. First is the Fractal Convolution methodology, a segmentation method based on image processing that successfully reveals subtle architectural patterns within these irreplaceable cultural buildings. The second is a revolutionary Self-Sensitive Tile Filling (SSTF) method created especially for West Bengal's mesmerising Bankura Terracotta Temples with a brand-new data augmentation method called MosaicSlice on the third. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the Super Resolution strategy to upscale the images without losing significant amount of quality. Our methods allow for the development of seamless region-filling and highly detailed tiles while maintaining authenticity using a novel data augmentation strategy within affordable costs introducing automation. By providing effective solutions that preserve the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, this study improves the subject and eventually ensures unrivalled efficiency and aesthetic excellence in cultural heritage protection. The suggested approaches advance the field into an era of unmatched efficiency and aesthetic quality while carefully upholding the delicate equilibrium between tradition and innovation.

- **[Dual form Complementary Masking for Domain-Adaptive Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12008)**  `arXiv:2507.12008`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Jiawen Wang, Yinda Chen, Xiaoyu Liu, Che Liu, Dong Liu, Jianqing Gao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent works have correlated Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with consistency regularization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). However, they merely treat masking as a special form of deformation on the input images and neglect the theoretical analysis, which leads to a superficial understanding of masked reconstruction and insufficient exploitation of its potential in enhancing feature extraction and representation learning. In this paper, we reframe masked reconstruction as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and theoretically prove that the dual form of complementary masks possesses superior capabilities in extracting domain-agnostic image features. Based on this compelling insight, we propose MaskTwins, a simple yet effective UDA framework that integrates masked reconstruction directly into the main training pipeline. MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across disparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked in complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods in natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the significant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features without the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for domain-adaptive segmentation.

- **[Position Prediction Self-Supervised Learning for Multimodal Satellite Imagery Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06852)**  `arXiv:2506.06852`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _John Waithaka, Moise Busogi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is crucial for Earth observation applications, but remains constrained by limited labelled training data. While self-supervised pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown promise, they focus on reconstruction rather than localisation-a fundamental aspect of segmentation tasks. We propose adapting LOCA (Location-aware), a position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite imagery semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of satellite data by extending SatMAE's channel grouping from multispectral to multimodal data, enabling effective handling of multiple modalities, and introducing same-group attention masking to encourage cross-modal interaction during pretraining. The method uses relative patch position prediction, encouraging spatial reasoning for localisation rather than reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on the Sen1Floods11 flood mapping dataset, where it significantly outperforms existing reconstruction-based self-supervised learning methods for satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that position prediction tasks, when properly adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, learn representations more effective for satellite image semantic segmentation than reconstruction-based approaches.

  _Haonan Wang, Qixiang Zhang, Lehan Wang, Xuanqi Huang, Xiaomeng Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Decoding visual stimuli from neural activity is essential for understanding the human brain. While fMRI methods have successfully reconstructed static images, fMRI-to-video reconstruction faces challenges due to the need for capturing spatiotemporal dynamics like motion and scene transitions. Recent approaches have improved semantic and perceptual alignment but struggle to integrate coarse fMRI data with detailed visual features. Inspired by the hierarchical organization of the visual system, we propose NEURONS, a novel framework that decouples learning into four correlated sub-tasks: key object segmentation, concept recognition, scene description, and blurry video reconstruction. This approach simulates the visual cortex's functional specialization, allowing the model to capture diverse video content. In the inference stage, NEURONS generates robust conditioning signals for a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion model to reconstruct the videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NEURONS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving solid improvements in video consistency (26.6%) and semantic-level accuracy (19.1%). Notably, NEURONS shows a strong functional correlation with the visual cortex, highlighting its potential for brain-computer interfaces and clinical applications.

  _Yuxi Xiao, Jianyuan Wang, Nan Xue, Nikita Karaev, Yuri Makarov, Bingyi Kang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present SpatialTrackerV2, a feed-forward 3D point tracking method for monocular videos. Going beyond modular pipelines built on off-the-shelf components for 3D tracking, our approach unifies the intrinsic connections between point tracking, monocular depth, and camera pose estimation into a high-performing and feedforward 3D point tracker. It decomposes world-space 3D motion into scene geometry, camera ego-motion, and pixel-wise object motion, with a fully differentiable and end-to-end architecture, allowing scalable training across a wide range of datasets, including synthetic sequences, posed RGB-D videos, and unlabeled in-the-wild footage. By learning geometry and motion jointly from such heterogeneous data, SpatialTrackerV2 outperforms existing 3D tracking methods by 30%, and matches the accuracy of leading dynamic 3D reconstruction approaches while running 50$\times$ faster.

  _Yuzhou Ji, Ke Ma, Hong Cai, Anchun Zhang, Lizhuang Ma, Xin Tan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dynamic driving scene reconstruction is of great importance in fields like digital twin system and autonomous driving simulation. However, unacceptable degradation occurs when the view deviates from the input trajectory, leading to corrupted background and vehicle models. To improve reconstruction quality on novel trajectory, existing methods are subject to various limitations including inconsistency, deformation, and time consumption. This paper proposes LidarPainter, a one-step diffusion model that recovers consistent driving views from sparse LiDAR condition and artifact-corrupted renderings in real-time, enabling high-fidelity lane shifts in driving scene reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that LidarPainter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in speed, quality and resource efficiency, specifically 7 x faster than StreetCrafter with only one fifth of GPU memory required. LidarPainter also supports stylized generation using text prompts such as "foggy" and "night", allowing for a diverse expansion of the existing asset library.

  Accurate 3D reconstruction of vehicles is vital for applications such as vehicle inspection, predictive maintenance, and urban planning. Existing methods like Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting have shown impressive results but remain limited by their reliance on dense input views, which hinders real-world applicability. This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing vehicles from sparse-view inputs, leveraging depth maps and a robust pose estimation architecture to synthesize novel views and augment training data. Specifically, we enhance Gaussian Splatting by integrating a selective photometric loss, applied only to high-confidence pixels, and replacing standard Structure-from-Motion pipelines with the DUSt3R architecture to improve camera pose estimation. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset featuring both synthetic and real-world public transportation vehicles, enabling extensive evaluation of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, showcasing the method's ability to achieve high-quality reconstructions even under constrained input conditions.

- **[Dark-EvGS: Event Camera as an Eye for Radiance Field in the Dark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11931)**  `arXiv:2507.11931`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jingqian Wu, Peiqi Duan, Zongqiang Wang, Changwei Wang, Boxin Shi, Edmund Y. Lam_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In low-light environments, conventional cameras often struggle to capture clear multi-view images of objects due to dynamic range limitations and motion blur caused by long exposure. Event cameras, with their high-dynamic range and high-speed properties, have the potential to mitigate these issues. Additionally, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables radiance field reconstruction, facilitating bright frame synthesis from multiple viewpoints in low-light conditions. However, naively using an event-assisted 3D GS approach still faced challenges because, in low light, events are noisy, frames lack quality, and the color tone may be inconsistent. To address these issues, we propose Dark-EvGS, the first event-assisted 3D GS framework that enables the reconstruction of bright frames from arbitrary viewpoints along the camera trajectory. Triplet-level supervision is proposed to gain holistic knowledge, granular details, and sharp scene rendering. The color tone matching block is proposed to guarantee the color consistency of the rendered frames. Furthermore, we introduce the first real-captured dataset for the event-guided bright frame synthesis task via 3D GS-based radiance field reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better results than existing methods, conquering radiance field reconstruction under challenging low-light conditions. The code and sample data are included in the supplementary material.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Establishing reliable correspondences between image pairs is a fundamental task in computer vision, underpinning applications such as 3D reconstruction and visual localization. Although recent methods have made progress in pruning outliers from dense correspondence sets, they often hypothesize consistent visual domains and overlook the challenges posed by diverse scene structures. In this paper, we propose CorrMoE, a novel correspondence pruning framework that enhances robustness under cross-domain and cross-scene variations. To address domain shift, we introduce a De-stylization Dual Branch, performing style mixing on both implicit and explicit graph features to mitigate the adverse influence of domain-specific representations. For scene diversity, we design a Bi-Fusion Mixture of Experts module that adaptively integrates multi-perspective features through linear-complexity attention and dynamic expert routing. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CorrMoE achieves superior accuracy and generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **[GS-I$^{3}$: Gaussian Splatting for Surface Reconstruction from Illumination-Inconsistent Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12335)**  `arXiv:2503.12335`  `cs.CV`  
  _Tengfei Wang, Xin Wang, Yongmao Hou, Zhaoning Zhang, Yiwei Xu, Zongqian Zhan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate geometric surface reconstruction, providing essential environmental information for navigation and manipulation tasks, is critical for enabling robotic self-exploration and interaction. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention in the field of surface reconstruction due to its impressive geometric quality and computational efficiency. While recent relevant advancements in novel view synthesis under inconsistent illumination using 3DGS have shown promise, the challenge of robust surface reconstruction under such conditions is still being explored. To address this challenge, we propose a method called GS-3I. Specifically, to mitigate 3D Gaussian optimization bias caused by underexposed regions in single-view images, based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a tone mapping correction framework is introduced. Furthermore, inconsistent lighting across multi-view images, resulting from variations in camera settings and complex scene illumination, often leads to geometric constraint mismatches and deviations in the reconstructed surface. To overcome this, we propose a normal compensation mechanism that integrates reference normals extracted from single-view image with normals computed from multi-view observations to effectively constrain geometric inconsistencies. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that GS-3I can achieve robust and accurate surface reconstruction across complex illumination scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and versatility in this critical challenge.this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, the transfer application of diffusion models in super-resolu-tion tasks has faced the problem ofdecreased fidelity. Due to the inherent randomsampling characteristics ofdiffusion models, direct application in super-resolu-tion tasks can result in generated details deviating from the true distribution ofhigh-resolution images. To address this, we propose DeltaDiff, a novelthis http URLthat constrains the difusion process, its essence is to establish a determin-istic mapping path between HR and LR, rather than the random noise disturbanceprocess oftraditional difusion models. Theoretical analysis demonstrates a 25%reduction in diffusion entropy in the residual space compared to pixel-space diffiusion, effectively suppressing irrelevant noise interference. The experimentalresults show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art models and generates re-sults with better fidelity. This work establishes a new low-rank constrained par-adigm for applying diffusion models to image reconstruction tasks, balancingstochastic generation with structural fidelity. Our code and model are publiclyavailable atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present DM-Calib, a diffusion-based approach for estimating pinhole camera intrinsic parameters from a single input image. Monocular camera calibration is essential for many 3D vision tasks. However, most existing methods depend on handcrafted assumptions or are constrained by limited training data, resulting in poor generalization across diverse real-world images. Recent advancements in stable diffusion models, trained on massive data, have shown the ability to generate high-quality images with varied characteristics. Emerging evidence indicates that these models implicitly capture the relationship between camera focal length and image content. Building on this insight, we explore how to leverage the powerful priors of diffusion models for monocular pinhole camera calibration. Specifically, we introduce a new image-based representation, termed Camera Image, which losslessly encodes the numerical camera intrinsics and integrates seamlessly with the diffusion framework. Using this representation, we reformulate the problem of estimating camera intrinsics as the generation of a dense Camera Image conditioned on an input image. By fine-tuning a stable diffusion model to generate a Camera Image from a single RGB input, we can extract camera intrinsics via a RANSAC operation. We further demonstrate that our monocular calibration method enhances performance across various 3D tasks, including zero-shot metric depth estimation, 3D metrology, pose estimation and sparse-view reconstruction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms baselines and provides broad benefits to 3D vision tasks.

- **[Generative Emergent Communication: Large Language Model is a Collective World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00226)**  `arXiv:2501.00226`  `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Tadahiro Taniguchi, Ryo Ueda, Tomoaki Nakamura, Masahiro Suzuki, Akira Taniguchi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to capture extensive world knowledge, yet how this is achieved without direct sensorimotor experience remains a fundamental puzzle. This study proposes a novel theoretical solution by introducing the Collective World Model hypothesis. We argue that an LLM does not learn a world model from scratch; instead, it learns a statistical approximation of a collective world model that is already implicitly encoded in human language through a society-wide process of embodied, interactive sense-making. To formalize this process, we introduce generative emergent communication (Generative EmCom), a framework built on the Collective Predictive Coding (CPC). This framework models the emergence of language as a process of decentralized Bayesian inference over the internal states of multiple agents. We argue that this process effectively creates an encoder-decoder structure at a societal scale: human society collectively encodes its grounded, internal representations into language, and an LLM subsequently decodes these symbols to reconstruct a latent space that mirrors the structure of the original collective representations. This perspective provides a principled, mathematical explanation for how LLMs acquire their capabilities. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) the formalization of the Generative EmCom framework, clarifying its connection to world models and multi-agent reinforcement learning, and 2) its application to interpret LLMs, explaining phenomena such as distributional semantics as a natural consequence of representation reconstruction. This work provides a unified theory that bridges individual cognitive development, collective language evolution, and the foundations of large-scale AI.
