- **[SuperMag: Vision-based Tactile Data Guided High-resolution Tactile Shape Reconstruction for Magnetic Tactile Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20002)**  `arXiv:2507.20002`  `cs.RO`

  Magnetic-based tactile sensors (MBTS) combine the advantages of compact design and high-frequency operation but suffer from limited spatial resolution due to their sparse taxel arrays. This paper proposes SuperMag, a tactile shape reconstruction method that addresses this limitation by leveraging high-resolution vision-based tactile sensor (VBTS) data to supervise MBTS super-resolution. Co-designed, open-source VBTS and MBTS with identical contact modules enable synchronized data collection of high-resolution shapes and magnetic signals via a symmetric calibration setup. We frame tactile shape reconstruction as a conditional generative problem, employing a conditional variational auto-encoder to infer high-resolution shapes from low-resolution MBTS inputs. The MBTS achieves a sampling frequency of 125 Hz, whereas the shape reconstruction sustains an inference time within 2.5 ms. This cross-modality synergy advances tactile perception of the MBTS, potentially unlocking its new capabilities in high-precision robotic tasks.

- **[High-Speed Event Vision-Based Tactile Roller Sensor for Large Surface Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19914)**  `arXiv:2507.19914`  `cs.RO`

  Inspecting large-scale industrial surfaces like aircraft fuselages for quality control requires capturing their precise 3D surface geometry at high resolution. Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTSs) offer high local resolution but require slow 'press-and-lift' measurements stitched for large areas. Approaches with sliding or roller/belt VBTS designs provide measurements continuity. However, they face significant challenges respectively: sliding struggles with friction/wear and both approaches are speed-limited by conventional camera frame rates and motion blur, making large-area scanning time consuming. Thus, a rapid, continuous, high-resolution method is needed. We introduce a novel tactile sensor integrating a neuromorphic camera in a rolling mechanism to achieve this. Leveraging its high temporal resolution and robustness to motion blur, our system uses a modified event-based multi-view stereo approach for 3D reconstruction. We demonstrate state-of-the-art scanning speeds up to 0.5 m/s, achieving Mean Absolute Error below 100 microns -- 11 times faster than prior continuous tactile sensing methods. A multi-reference Bayesian fusion strategy enhances accuracy (reducing MAE by 25.2\% compared to EMVS) and mitigates curvature errors. We also validate high-speed feature recognition via Braille reading 2.6 times faster than previous approaches.

- **[GSplatVNM: Point-of-View Synthesis for Visual Navigation Models Using Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05152)**  `arXiv:2503.05152`  `cs.RO`  
  _Kohei Honda, Takeshi Ishita, Yasuhiro Yoshimura, Ryo Yonetani_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a novel approach to image-goal navigation by integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with Visual Navigation Models (VNMs), a method we refer to as GSplatVNM. VNMs offer a promising paradigm for image-goal navigation by guiding a robot through a sequence of point-of-view images without requiring metrical localization or environment-specific training. However, constructing a dense and traversable sequence of target viewpoints from start to goal remains a central challenge, particularly when the available image database is sparse. To address these challenges, we propose a 3DGS-based viewpoint synthesis framework for VNMs that synthesizes intermediate viewpoints to seamlessly bridge gaps in sparse data while significantly reducing storage overhead. Experimental results in a photorealistic simulator demonstrate that our approach not only enhances navigation efficiency but also exhibits robustness under varying levels of image database sparsity.

- **[Flow Matching Policy Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21053)**  `arXiv:2507.21053`  `cs.LG` `cs.RO`  
  _David McAllister, Songwei Ge, Brent Yi, Chung Min Kim, Ethan Weber, Hongsuk Choi, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flow-based generative models, including diffusion models, excel at modeling continuous distributions in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we introduce Flow Policy Optimization (FPO), a simple on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that brings flow matching into the policy gradient framework. FPO casts policy optimization as maximizing an advantage-weighted ratio computed from the conditional flow matching loss, in a manner compatible with the popular PPO-clip framework. It sidesteps the need for exact likelihood computation while preserving the generative capabilities of flow-based models. Unlike prior approaches for diffusion-based reinforcement learning that bind training to a specific sampling method, FPO is agnostic to the choice of diffusion or flow integration at both training and inference time. We show that FPO can train diffusion-style policies from scratch in a variety of continuous control tasks. We find that flow-based models can capture multimodal action distributions and achieve higher performance than Gaussian policies, particularly in under-conditioned settings.

  Large language models (LLMs) have seen substantial growth, necessitating efficient model pruning techniques. Existing post-training pruning methods primarily measure weight importance in converged dense models, often overlooking changes in weight significance during the pruning process, leading to performance degradation. To address this issue, we present LLM-Barber (Block-Aware Rebuilder for Sparsity Mask in One-Shot), a novel one-shot pruning framework that rebuilds the sparsity mask of pruned models without any retraining or weight reconstruction. LLM-Barber incorporates block-aware error optimization across Self-Attention and MLP blocks, facilitating global performance optimization. We are the first to employ the product of weights and gradients as a pruning metric in the context of LLM post-training pruning. This enables accurate identification of weight importance in massive models and significantly reduces computational complexity compared to methods using secondorder information. Our experiments show that LLM-Barber efficiently prunes models from LLaMA and OPT families (7B to 13B) on a single A100 GPU in just 30 minutes, achieving state-of-the-art results in both perplexity and zero-shot performance across various language benchmarks.

- **[Robust Taxi Fare Prediction Under Noisy Conditions: A Comparative Study of GAT, TimesNet, and XGBoost](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20008)**  `arXiv:2507.20008`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Padmavathi Moorthy_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Precise fare prediction is crucial in ride-hailing platforms and urban mobility systems. This study examines three machine learning models-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), XGBoost, and TimesNet to evaluate their predictive capabilities for taxi fares using a real-world dataset comprising over 55 million records. Both raw (noisy) and denoised versions of the dataset are analyzed to assess the impact of data quality on model performance. The study evaluated the models along multiple axes, including predictive accuracy, calibration, uncertainty estimation, out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, and feature sensitivity. We also explore pre-processing strategies, including KNN imputation, Gaussian noise injection, and autoencoder-based denoising. The study reveals critical differences between classical and deep learning models under realistic conditions, offering practical guidelines for building robust and scalable models in urban fare prediction systems.

- **[Tractable Representation Learning with Probabilistic Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04385)**  `arXiv:2507.04385`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are powerful probabilistic models that enable exact and tractable inference, making them highly suitable for probabilistic reasoning and inference tasks. While dominant in neural networks, representation learning with PCs remains underexplored, with prior approaches relying on external neural embeddings or activation-based encodings. To address this gap, we introduce autoencoding probabilistic circuits (APCs), a novel framework leveraging the tractability of PCs to model probabilistic embeddings explicitly. APCs extend PCs by jointly modeling data and embeddings, obtaining embedding representations through tractable probabilistic inference. The PC encoder allows the framework to natively handle arbitrary missing data and is seamlessly integrated with a neural decoder in a hybrid, end-to-end trainable architecture enabled by differentiable sampling. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that APCs outperform existing PC-based autoencoding methods in reconstruction quality, generate embeddings competitive with, and exhibit superior robustness in handling missing data compared to neural autoencoders. These results highlight APCs as a powerful and flexible representation learning method that exploits the probabilistic inference capabilities of PCs, showing promising directions for robust inference, out-of-distribution detection, and knowledge distillation.

- **[Novel Pivoted Cholesky Decompositions for Efficient Gaussian Process Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20678)**  `arXiv:2507.20678`  `cs.LG`  
  _Filip de Roos, Fabio Muratore_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Cholesky decomposition is a fundamental tool for solving linear systems with symmetric and positive definite matrices which are ubiquitous in linear algebra, optimization, and machine learning. Its numerical stability can be improved by introducing a pivoting strategy that iteratively permutes the rows and columns of the matrix. The order of pivoting indices determines how accurately the intermediate decomposition can reconstruct the original matrix, thus is decisive for the algorithm's efficiency in the case of early termination. Standard implementations select the next pivot from the largest value on the diagonal. In the case of Bayesian nonparametric inference, this strategy corresponds to greedy entropy maximization, which is often used in active learning and design of experiments. We explore this connection in detail and deduce novel pivoting strategies for the Cholesky decomposition. The resulting algorithms are more efficient at reducing the uncertainty over a data set, can be updated to include information about observations, and additionally benefit from a tailored implementation. We benchmark the effectiveness of the new selection strategies on two tasks important to Gaussian processes: sparse regression and inference based on preconditioned iterative solvers. Our results show that the proposed selection strategies are either on par or, in most cases, outperform traditional baselines while requiring a negligible amount of additional computation.

- **[Kernel Learning for Sample Constrained Black-Box Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20533)**  `arXiv:2507.20533`  `cs.LG`  
  _Rajalaxmi Rajagopalan, Yu-Lin Wei, Romit Roy Choudhury_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Black box optimization (BBO) focuses on optimizing unknown functions in high-dimensional spaces. In many applications, sampling the unknown function is expensive, imposing a tight sample budget. Ongoing work is making progress on reducing the sample budget by learning the shape/structure of the function, known as kernel learning. We propose a new method to learn the kernel of a Gaussian Process. Our idea is to create a continuous kernel space in the latent space of a variational autoencoder, and run an auxiliary optimization to identify the best kernel. Results show that the proposed method, Kernel Optimized Blackbox Optimization (KOBO), outperforms state of the art by estimating the optimal at considerably lower sample budgets. Results hold not only across synthetic benchmark functions but also in real applications. We show that a hearing aid may be personalized with fewer audio queries to the user, or a generative model could converge to desirable images from limited user ratings.

- **[Attributed Graph Clustering with Multi-Scale Weight-Based Pairwise Coarsening and Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20505)**  `arXiv:2507.20505`  `cs.LG`  
  _Binxiong Li, Yuefei Wang, Binyu Zhao, Heyang Gao, Benhan Yang, Quanzhou Luo, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study introduces the Multi-Scale Weight-Based Pairwise Coarsening and Contrastive Learning (MPCCL) model, a novel approach for attributed graph clustering that effectively bridges critical gaps in existing methods, including long-range dependency, feature collapse, and information loss. Traditional methods often struggle to capture high-order graph features due to their reliance on low-order attribute information, while contrastive learning techniques face limitations in feature diversity by overemphasizing local neighborhood structures. Similarly, conventional graph coarsening methods, though reducing graph scale, frequently lose fine-grained structural details. MPCCL addresses these challenges through an innovative multi-scale coarsening strategy, which progressively condenses the graph while prioritizing the merging of key edges based on global node similarity to preserve essential structural information. It further introduces a one-to-many contrastive learning paradigm, integrating node embeddings with augmented graph views and cluster centroids to enhance feature diversity, while mitigating feature masking issues caused by the accumulation of high-frequency node weights during multi-scale coarsening. By incorporating a graph reconstruction loss and KL divergence into its self-supervised learning framework, MPCCL ensures cross-scale consistency of node representations. Experimental evaluations reveal that MPCCL achieves a significant improvement in clustering performance, including a remarkable 15.24% increase in NMI on the ACM dataset and notable robust gains on smaller-scale datasets such as Citeseer, Cora and DBLP.

- **[BOASF: A Unified Framework for Speeding up Automatic Machine Learning via Adaptive Successive Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20446)**  `arXiv:2507.20446`  `cs.LG`  
  _Guanghui Zhu, Xin Fang, Lei Wang, Wenzhong Chen, Rong Gu, Chunfeng Yuan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine learning has been making great success in many application areas. However, for the non-expert practitioners, it is always very challenging to address a machine learning task successfully and efficiently. Finding the optimal machine learning model or the hyperparameter combination set from a large number of possible alternatives usually requires considerable expert knowledge and experience. To tackle this problem, we propose a combined Bayesian Optimization and Adaptive Successive Filtering algorithm (BOASF) under a unified multi-armed bandit framework to automate the model selection or the hyperparameter optimization. Specifically, BOASF consists of multiple evaluation rounds in each of which we select promising configurations for each arm using the Bayesian optimization. Then, ASF can early discard the poor-performed arms adaptively using a Gaussian UCB-based probabilistic model. Furthermore, a Softmax model is employed to adaptively allocate available resources for each promising arm that advances to the next round. The arm with a higher probability of advancing will be allocated more resources. Experimental results show that BOASF is effective for speeding up the model selection and hyperparameter optimization processes while achieving robust and better prediction performance than the existing state-of-the-art automatic machine learning methods. Moreover, BOASF achieves better anytime performance under various time budgets.

  Deep learning neural networks architectures such Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Convolutional blocks still play a crucial role in nowadays research advancements. From a topological point of view, these architecture may be represented as graphs in which we learn the functions related to the nodes while fixed edges convey the information from the input to the output. A recent work introduced a new architecture called Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KAN) that reports how putting learnable activation functions on the edges of the neural network leads to better performances in multiple scenarios. Multiple studies are focusing on optimizing the KAN architecture by adding important features such as dropout regularization, Autoencoders (AE), model benchmarking and last, but not least, the KAN Convolutional Network (KCN) that introduced matrix convolution with KANs learning. This study aims to benchmark multiple versions of vanilla AEs (such as Linear, Convolutional and Variational) against their Kolmogorov-Arnold counterparts that have same or less number of parameters. Using cardiological signals as model input, a total of five different classic AE tasks were studied: reconstruction, generation, denoising, inpainting and anomaly detection. The proposed experiments uses a medical dataset \textit{AbnormalHeartbeat} that contains audio signals obtained from the stethoscope.

- **[Hypergraph Neural Networks Reveal Spatial Domains from Single-cell Transcriptomics Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19868)**  `arXiv:2410.19868`  `cs.LG`  
  _Mehrad Soltani, Luis Rueda_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The task of spatial clustering of transcriptomics data is of paramount importance. It enables the classification of tissue samples into diverse subpopulations of cells, which, in turn, facilitates the analysis of the biological functions of clusters, tissue reconstruction, and cell-cell interactions. Many approaches leverage gene expressions, spatial locations, and histological images to detect spatial domains; however, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as state of the art models suffer from a limitation in the assumption of pairwise connections between nodes. In the case of domain detection in spatial transcriptomics, some cells are found to be not directly related. Still, they are grouped as the same domain, which shows the incapability of GNNs for capturing implicit connections among the cells.While graph edges connect only two nodes, hyperedges connect an arbitrary number of nodes along their edges, which lets Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) capture and utilize richer and more complex structural information than traditional GNNs. We use autoencoders to address the limitation of not having the actual labels, which are well-suited for unsupervised learning. Our model has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving the highest iLISI score of 1.843 compared to other methods. This score indicates the greatest diversity of cell types identified by our method. Furthermore, our model outperforms other methods in downstream clustering, achieving the highest ARI values of 0.51 and Leiden score of 0.60.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of geometric reconstruction and generative modeling remains a critical challenge in developing AI systems capable of human-like spatial reasoning. This paper proposes Aether, a unified framework that enables geometry-aware reasoning in world models by jointly optimizing three core capabilities: (1) 4D dynamic reconstruction, (2) action-conditioned video prediction, and (3) goal-conditioned visual planning. Through task-interleaved feature learning, Aether achieves synergistic knowledge sharing across reconstruction, prediction, and planning objectives. Building upon video generation models, our framework demonstrates zero-shot synthetic-to-real generalization despite never observing real-world data during training. Furthermore, our approach achieves zero-shot generalization in both action following and reconstruction tasks, thanks to its intrinsic geometric modeling. Notably, even without real-world data, its reconstruction performance is comparable with or even better than that of domain-specific models. Additionally, Aether employs camera trajectories as geometry-informed action spaces, enabling effective action-conditioned prediction and visual planning. We hope our work inspires the community to explore new frontiers in physically-reasonable world modeling and its applications.

- **[NeuroVoxel-LM: Language-Aligned 3D Perception via Dynamic Voxelization and Meta-Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20110)**  `arXiv:2507.20110`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Shiyu Liu, Lianlei Shan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent breakthroughs in Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced 3D scene perception towards language-driven cognition. However, existing 3D language models struggle with sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited representation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroVoxel-LM, a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with dynamic resolution voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding. Specifically, we introduce a Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) technique that adaptively adjusts voxel granularity based on geometric and structural complexity, reducing computational cost while preserving reconstruction fidelity. In addition, we propose the Token-level Adaptive Pooling for Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) mechanism, which enhances semantic representation through attention-based weighting and residual fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that DR-MSV significantly improves point cloud feature extraction efficiency and accuracy, while TAP-LME outperforms conventional max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics from NeRF weights.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled the creation of deceptively real images, posing significant security risks when misused. In this study, we empirically show that different timesteps of DDIM inversion reveal varying subtle distinctions between synthetic and real images that are extractable for detection, in the forms of such as Fourier power spectrum high-frequency discrepancies and inter-pixel variance distributions. Based on these observations, we propose a novel synthetic image detection method that directly utilizes features of intermediately noised images by training an ensemble on multiple noised timesteps, circumventing conventional reconstruction-based strategies. To enhance human comprehension, we introduce a metric-grounded explanation generation and refinement module to identify and explain AI-generated flaws. Additionally, we construct the GenHard and GenExplain benchmarks to provide detection samples of greater difficulty and high-quality rationales for fake images. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 98.91% and 95.89% detection accuracy on regular and challenging samples respectively, and demonstrates generalizability and robustness.

- **[Learning Phonetic Context-Dependent Viseme for Enhancing Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20568)**  `arXiv:2507.20568`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Hyung Kyu Kim, Hak Gu Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D facial animation. Project page:this https URL

  _Xiaokai Bai, Chenxu Zhou, Lianqing Zheng, Si-Yuan Cao, Jianan Liu, Xiaohan Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensor for autonomous driving, but effective 3D object detection from both 4D radar and monocular images remains a challenge. Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection. 3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA) fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Constructing a compressed latent space through a variational autoencoder (VAE) is the key for efficient 3D diffusion models. This paper introduces COD-VAE that encodes 3D shapes into a COmpact set of 1D latent vectors without sacrificing quality. COD-VAE introduces a two-stage autoencoder scheme to improve compression and decoding efficiency. First, our encoder block progressively compresses point clouds into compact latent vectors via intermediate point patches. Second, our triplane-based decoder reconstructs dense triplanes from latent vectors instead of directly decoding neural fields, significantly reducing computational overhead of neural fields decoding. Finally, we propose uncertainty-guided token pruning, which allocates resources adaptively by skipping computations in simpler regions and improves the decoder efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that COD-VAE achieves 16x compression compared to the baseline while maintaining quality. This enables 20.8x speedup in generation, highlighting that a large number of latent vectors is not a prerequisite for high-quality reconstruction and generation. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neuromorphic cameras, also known as event cameras, are asynchronous brightness-change sensors that can capture extremely fast motion without suffering from motion blur, making them particularly promising for 3D reconstruction in extreme environments. However, existing research on 3D reconstruction using monocular neuromorphic cameras is limited, and most of the methods rely on estimating physical priors and employ complex multi-step pipelines. In this work, we propose an end-to-end method for dense voxel 3D reconstruction using neuromorphic cameras that eliminates the need to estimate physical priors. Our method incorporates a novel event representation to enhance edge features, enabling the proposed feature-enhancement model to learn more effectively. Additionally, we introduced Optimal Binarization Threshold Selection Principle as a guideline for future related work, using the optimal reconstruction results achieved with threshold optimization as the benchmark. Our method achieves a 54.6% improvement in reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline method.

  Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI, which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally, existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes (e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints. We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date project page:this https URL.

- **[Event-Based De-Snowing for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20901)**  `arXiv:2507.20901`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adverse weather conditions, particularly heavy snowfall, pose significant challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Traditional image-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they rely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high frame rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera parameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes, making the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network generalization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing by using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with submillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the presence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions appear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal representation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses on events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded and use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our method on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that overlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset, resulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for image reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth estimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\%$ performance improvement over other de-snowing methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate forest height estimation is crucial for climate change monitoring and carbon cycle assessment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly in multi-channel configurations, has provided support for a long time in 3D forest structure reconstruction through model-based techniques. More recently, data-driven approaches using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have enabled new opportunities for forest parameter retrieval. This paper introduces FGump, a forest height estimation framework by gradient boosting using multi-channel SAR processing with LiDAR profiles as Ground Truth(GT). Unlike typical ML and DL approaches that require large datasets and complex architectures, FGump ensures a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, using a limited set of hand-designed features and avoiding heavy preprocessing (e.g., calibration and/or quantization). Evaluated under both classification and regression paradigms, the proposed framework demonstrates that the regression formulation enables fine-grained, continuous estimations and avoids quantization artifacts by resulting in more precise measurements without rounding. Experimental results confirm that FGump outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI-based and classical methods, achieving higher accuracy and significantly lower training and inference times, as demonstrated in our results.

  The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS), which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and complementary information. The main processing path of this framework integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness of the DAMS framework.

  We propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework for outdoor relighting that leverages intrinsic image decomposition to precisely integrate sunlight, sky radiance, and indirect lighting from unconstrained photo collections. Unlike prior methods that compress the per-image global illumination into a single latent vector, our approach enables simultaneously diverse shading manipulation and the generation of dynamic shadow effects. This is achieved through three key innovations: (1) a residual-based sun visibility extraction method to accurately separate direct sunlight effects, (2) a region-based supervision framework with a structural consistency loss for physically interpretable and coherent illumination decomposition, and (3) a ray-tracing-based technique for realistic shadow simulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework synthesizes novel views with competitive fidelity against state-of-the-art relighting solutions and produces more natural and multifaceted illumination and shadow effects.

  In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)-based scene representation demonstrates significant potential in real-time rendering and training efficiency. However, most existing methods primarily focus on single-map reconstruction, while the registration and fusion of multiple 3D-GS sub-maps remain underexplored. Existing methods typically rely on manual intervention to select a reference sub-map as a template and use point cloud matching for registration. Moreover, hard-threshold filtering of 3D-GS primitives often degrades rendering quality after fusion. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automated 3D-GS sub-map alignment and fusion, eliminating the need for manual intervention while enhancing registration accuracy and fusion quality. First, we extract geometric skeletons across multiple scenes and leverage ellipsoid-aware convolution to capture 3D-GS attributes, facilitating robust scene registration. Second, we introduce a multi-factor Gaussian fusion strategy to mitigate the scene element loss caused by rigid thresholding. Experiments on the ScanNet-GSReg and our Coord datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in registration and fusion. For registration, it achieves a 41.9\% reduction in RRE on complex scenes, ensuring more precise pose estimation. For fusion, it improves PSNR by 10.11 dB, highlighting superior structural preservation. These results confirm its ability to enhance scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, ensuring more consistent and accurate 3D scene representation for robotic perception and autonomous navigation.

  Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the presence of noise, loss of detail, and poor contrast in images captured under insufficient lighting conditions. Recent methods often rely solely on pixel-level transformations of RGB images, neglecting the rich contextual information available from multiple visual modalities. In this paper, we present ModalFormer, the first large-scale multimodal framework for LLIE that fully exploits nine auxiliary modalities to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our model comprises two main components: a Cross-modal Transformer (CM-T) designed to restore corrupted images while seamlessly integrating multimodal information, and multiple auxiliary subnetworks dedicated to multimodal feature reconstruction. Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal Multi-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB data with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings, segmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate information-rich hybrid attention maps. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate ModalFormer's state-of-the-art performance in LLIE. Pre-trained models and results are made available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Impressive results on real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have been achieved by employing pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) models. However, one critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive resolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\times$ downsampling) in the SD model. One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion; however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the 8$\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\times$ one while adapting to the pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\times$ decoder based on the output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\times$ encoder while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features. Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion models.

  Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification, facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and generalized EEG models.

  Motion skeletons drive 3D character animation by transforming bone hierarchies, but differences in proportions or structure make motion data hard to transfer across skeletons, posing challenges for data-driven motion synthesis. Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) offer an unstructured, cross-compatible motion representation. Though reversible with skeletons, TPCs mainly serve for compatibility, not for direct motion task learning. Doing so would require data synthesis capabilities for the TPC format, which presents unexplored challenges regarding its unique temporal consistency and point identifiability. Therefore, we propose PUMPS, the primordial autoencoder architecture for TPC data. PUMPS independently reduces frame-wise point clouds into sampleable feature vectors, from which a decoder extracts distinct temporal points using latent Gaussian noise vectors as sampling identifiers. We introduce linear assignment-based point pairing to optimise the TPC reconstruction process, and negate the use of expensive point-wise attention mechanisms in the architecture. Using these latent features, we pre-train a motion synthesis model capable of performing motion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation. For these pre-training tasks, PUMPS performs remarkably well even without native dataset supervision, matching state-of-the-art performance. When fine-tuned for motion denoising or estimation, PUMPS outperforms many respective methods without deviating from its generalist architecture.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study proposes a reconstruction-based framework for detecting medial epicondyle avulsion in elbow ultrasound images, trained exclusively on normal cases. Medial epicondyle avulsion, commonly observed in baseball players, involves bone detachment and deformity, often appearing as discontinuities in bone contour. Therefore, learning the structure and continuity of normal bone is essential for detecting such abnormalities. To achieve this, we propose a masked autoencoder-based, structure-aware reconstruction framework that learns the continuity of normal bone structures. Even in the presence of avulsion, the model attempts to reconstruct the normal structure, resulting in large reconstruction errors at the avulsion site. For evaluation, we constructed a novel dataset comprising normal and avulsion ultrasound images from 16 baseball players, with pixel-level annotations under orthopedic supervision. Our method outperformed existing approaches, achieving a pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and an image-wise AUC of 0.967. The dataset is publicly available at:this https URL.

  The introduction of the neural implicit representation has notably propelled the advancement of online dense reconstruction techniques. Compared to traditional explicit representations, such as TSDF, it improves the mapping completeness and memory efficiency. However, the lack of reconstruction details and the time-consuming learning of neural representations hinder the widespread application of neural-based methods to large-scale online reconstruction. We introduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene reconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a residual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and an implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained details to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for detail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting with the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus paving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the residual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via bundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize poses directly, we opt to optimize pose changes. Combined with a novel technique for adaptive gradient amplification, our method attains better optimization convergence and global optimality. Furthermore, we adopt a local moving volume to factorize the mixed scene representation with a divide-and-conquer design to facilitate efficient online learning in our residual-based framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses all state-of-the-art ones, including those based either on explicit or implicit representations, in terms of the accuracy of both mapping and tracking on large-scale scenes.

  The misaligned human texture across different human parts is one of the main limitations of existing 3D human reconstruction methods. Each human part, such as a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into others. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to infer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most existing 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part segmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions. In this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a key guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core components. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we propose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially reconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based on the textureless surface. Second, to incorporate part information into texture reconstruction, we introduce a part-guided texturing module (PartTexturer), which acquires prior knowledge from a pre-trained image generation network on texture alignment of human parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human reconstruction. The project page is available atthis https URL.

  Surface reconstruction and novel view rendering from sparse-view images are challenging. Signed Distance Function (SDF)-based methods struggle with fine details, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based approaches lack global geometry coherence. We propose a novel hybrid method that combines the strengths of both approaches: SDF captures coarse geometry to enhance 3DGS-based rendering, while newly rendered images from 3DGS refine the details of SDF for accurate surface reconstruction. As a result, our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis on the DTU and MobileBrick datasets. Code will be released atthis https URL.

  We introduce a novel visual tokenization framework that embeds a provable PCA-like structure into the latent token space. While existing visual tokenizers primarily optimize for reconstruction fidelity, they often neglect the structural properties of the latent space--a critical factor for both interpretability and downstream tasks. Our method generates a 1D causal token sequence for images, where each successive token contributes non-overlapping information with mathematically guaranteed decreasing explained variance, analogous to principal component analysis. This structural constraint ensures the tokenizer extracts the most salient visual features first, with each subsequent token adding diminishing yet complementary information. Additionally, we identified and resolved a semantic-spectrum coupling effect that causes the unwanted entanglement of high-level semantic content and low-level spectral details in the tokens by leveraging a diffusion decoder. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and enables better interpretability to align with the human vision system. Moreover, autoregressive models trained on our token sequences achieve performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while requiring fewer tokens for training and inference.

  The rapid advancement of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models has enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, presenting significant societal risks, such as misinformation and deception. As a result, detecting AI-generated images has emerged as a critical challenge. Existing researches emphasize extracting fine-grained features to enhance detector generalization, yet they often lack consideration for the importance and interdependencies of internal elements within local regions and are limited to a single frequency domain, hindering the capture of general forgery traces. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we first utilize a sliding window to restrict the attention mechanism to a local window, and reconstruct the features within the window to model the relationships between neighboring internal elements within the local region. Then, we design a dual frequency domain branch framework consisting of four frequency domain subbands of DWT and the phase part of FFT to enrich the extraction of local forgery features from different perspectives. Through feature enrichment of dual frequency domain branches and fine-grained feature extraction of reconstruction sliding window attention, our method achieves superior generalization detection capabilities on both GAN and diffusion model-based generative images. Evaluated on diverse datasets comprising images from 65 distinct generative models, our approach achieves a 2.13\% improvement in detection accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

  Existing approaches to drone visual geo-localization predominantly adopt the image-based setting, where a single drone-view snapshot is matched with images from other platforms. Such task formulation, however, underutilizes the inherent video output of the drone and is sensitive to occlusions and viewpoint disparity. To address these limitations, we formulate a new video-based drone geo-localization task and propose the Video2BEV paradigm. This paradigm transforms the video into a Bird's Eye View (BEV), simplifying the subsequent \textbf{inter-platform} matching process. In particular, we employ Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct a 3D scene and obtain the BEV projection. Different from the existing transform methods, \eg, polar transform, our BEVs preserve more fine-grained details without significant distortion. To facilitate the discriminative \textbf{intra-platform} representation learning, our Video2BEV paradigm also incorporates a diffusion-based module for generating hard negative samples. To validate our approach, we introduce UniV, a new video-based geo-localization dataset that extends the image-based University-1652 dataset. UniV features flight paths at $30^\circ$ and $45^\circ$ elevation angles with increased frame rates of up to 10 frames per second (FPS). Extensive experiments on the UniV dataset show that our Video2BEV paradigm achieves competitive recall rates and outperforms conventional video-based methods. Compared to other competitive methods, our proposed approach exhibits robustness at lower elevations with more occlusions.

  Recent advancements in 3D generation models have opened new possibilities for simulating dynamic 3D object movements and customizing behaviors, yet creating this content remains challenging. Current methods often require manual assignment of precise physical properties for simulations or rely on video generation models to predict them, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we rethink the usage of multi-modal large language model (MLLM) in physics-based simulation, and present Sim Anything, a physics-based approach that endows static 3D objects with interactive dynamics. We begin with detailed scene reconstruction and object-level 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, progressing to multi-view image in-painting. Inspired by human visual reasoning, we propose MLLM-based Physical Property Perception (MLLM-P3) to predict mean physical properties of objects in a zero-shot manner. Based on the mean values and the object's geometry, the Material Property Distribution Prediction model (MPDP) model then estimates the full distribution, reformulating the problem as probability distribution estimation to reduce computational costs. Finally, we simulate objects in an open-world scene with particles sampled via the Physical-Geometric Adaptive Sampling (PGAS) strategy, efficiently capturing complex deformations and significantly reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate our Sim Anything achieves more realistic motion than state-of-the-art methods within 2 minutes on a single GPU.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We aim to address sparse-view reconstruction of a 3D scene by leveraging priors from large-scale vision models. While recent advancements such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable successes in 3D reconstruction, these methods typically necessitate hundreds of input images that densely capture the underlying scene, making them time-consuming and impractical for real-world applications. However, sparse-view reconstruction is inherently ill-posed and under-constrained, often resulting in inferior and incomplete outcomes. This is due to issues such as failed initialization, overfitting on input images, and a lack of details. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce LM-Gaussian, a method capable of generating high-quality reconstructions from a limited number of images. Specifically, we propose a robust initialization module that leverages stereo priors to aid in the recovery of camera poses and the reliable point clouds. Additionally, a diffusion-based refinement is iteratively applied to incorporate image diffusion priors into the Gaussian optimization process to preserve intricate scene details. Finally, we utilize video diffusion priors to further enhance the rendered images for realistic visual effects. Overall, our approach significantly reduces the data acquisition requirements compared to previous 3DGS methods. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on various public datasets, demonstrating its potential for high-quality 360-degree scene reconstruction.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the character animation field, modern supervised keyframe interpolation models have demonstrated exceptional performance in constructing natural human motions from sparse pose definitions. As supervised models, large motion datasets are necessary to facilitate the learning process; however, since motion is represented with fixed hierarchical skeletons, such datasets are incompatible for skeletons outside the datasets' native configurations. Consequently, the expected availability of a motion dataset for desired skeletons severely hinders the feasibility of learned interpolation in practice. To combat this limitation, we propose Point Cloud-based Motion Representation Learning (PC-MRL), an unsupervised approach to enabling cross-compatibility between skeletons for motion interpolation learning. PC-MRL consists of a skeleton obfuscation strategy using temporal point cloud sampling, and an unsupervised skeleton reconstruction method from point clouds. We devise a temporal point-wise K-nearest neighbors loss for unsupervised learning. Moreover, we propose First-frame Offset Quaternion (FOQ) and Rest Pose Augmentation (RPA) strategies to overcome necessary limitations of our unsupervised point cloud-to-skeletal motion process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PC-MRL in motion interpolation for desired skeletons without supervision from native datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We show that the scaling laws which determine the performance of large language models (LLMs) severely limit their ability to improve the uncertainty of their predictions. As a result, raising their reliability to meet the standards of scientific inquiry is intractable by any reasonable measure. We argue that the very mechanism which fuels much of the learning power of LLMs, namely the ability to generate non-Gaussian output distributions from Gaussian input ones, might well be at the roots of their propensity to produce error pileup, ensuing information catastrophes and degenerative AI behaviour. This tension between learning and accuracy is a likely candidate mechanism underlying the observed low values of the scaling components. It is substantially compounded by the deluge of spurious correlations pointed out by Calude and Longo which rapidly increase in any data set merely as a function of its size, regardless of its nature. The fact that a degenerative AI pathway is a very probable feature of the LLM landscape does not mean that it must inevitably arise in all future AI research. Its avoidance, which we also discuss in this paper, necessitates putting a much higher premium on insight and understanding of the structural characteristics of the problems being investigated.
