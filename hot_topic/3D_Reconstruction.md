- **[ASHiTA: Automatic Scene-grounded HIerarchical Task Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06553)**  `arXiv:2504.06553`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  While recent work in scene reconstruction and understanding has made strides in grounding natural language to physical 3D environments, it is still challenging to ground abstract, high-level instructions to a 3D scene. High-level instructions might not explicitly invoke semantic elements in the scene, and even the process of breaking a high-level task into a set of more concrete subtasks, a process called hierarchical task analysis, is environment-dependent. In this work, we propose ASHiTA, the first framework that generates a task hierarchy grounded to a 3D scene graph by breaking down high-level tasks into grounded subtasks. ASHiTA alternates LLM-assisted hierarchical task analysis, to generate the task breakdown, with task-driven 3D scene graph construction to generate a suitable representation of the environment. Our experiments show that ASHiTA performs significantly better than LLM baselines in breaking down high-level tasks into environment-dependent subtasks and is additionally able to achieve grounding performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

- **[SuperQ-GRASP: Superquadrics-based Grasp Pose Estimation on Larger Objects for Mobile-Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04386)**  `arXiv:2411.04386`  `cs.RO`  
  _Xun Tu, Karthik Desingh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Grasp planning and estimation have been a longstanding research problem in robotics, with two main approaches to find graspable poses on the objects: 1) geometric approach, which relies on 3D models of objects and the gripper to estimate valid grasp poses, and 2) data-driven, learning-based approach, with models trained to identify grasp poses from raw sensor observations. The latter assumes comprehensive geometric coverage during the training phase. However, the data-driven approach is typically biased toward tabletop scenarios and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios with larger objects (e.g. chair). Additionally, raw sensor data (e.g. RGB-D data) from a single view of these larger objects is often incomplete and necessitates additional observations. In this paper, we take a geometric approach, leveraging advancements in object modeling (e.g. NeRF) to build an implicit model by taking RGB images from views around the target object. This model enables the extraction of explicit mesh model while also capturing the visual appearance from novel viewpoints that is useful for perception tasks like object detection and pose estimation. We further decompose the NeRF-reconstructed 3D mesh into superquadrics (SQs) -- parametric geometric primitives, each mapped to a set of precomputed grasp poses, allowing grasp composition on the target object based on these primitives. Our proposed pipeline overcomes the problems: a) noisy depth and incomplete view of the object, with a modeling step, and b) generalization to objects of any size.

- **[GOLLuM: Gaussian Process Optimized LLMs -- Reframing LLM Finetuning through Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06265)**  `arXiv:2504.06265`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Bojana Rankoviƒá, Philippe Schwaller_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) can encode complex relationships in their latent spaces, yet harnessing them for optimization under uncertainty remains challenging. We address this gap with a novel architecture that reframes LLM finetuning as Gaussian process (GP) marginal likelihood optimization via deep kernel methods. We introduce LLM-based deep kernels, jointly optimized with GPs to preserve the benefits of both - LLMs to provide a rich and flexible input space for Bayesian optimization and - GPs to model this space with predictive uncertainty for more efficient sampling. Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reaction optimization, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-performing reactions compared to static LLM embeddings (from 24% to 43% coverage of the top 5% reactions in just 50 optimization iterations). We also observe a 14% improvement over domain-specific representations without requiring specialized features. Extensive empirical evaluation across 19 benchmarks - ranging from general chemistry to reaction and molecular property optimization - demonstrates our method's robustness, generality, and consistent improvements across: (1) tasks, (2) LLM architectures (encoder, decoder, encoder-decoder), (3) pretraining domains (chemistry-related or general-purpose) and (4) hyperparameter settings (tuned once on a single dataset). Finally, we explain these improvements: joint LLM-GP optimization through marginal likelihood implicitly performs contrastive learning, aligning representations to produce (1) better-structured embedding spaces, (2) improved uncertainty calibration, and (3) more efficient sampling - without requiring any external loss. This work provides both practical advances in sample-efficient optimization and insights into what makes effective Bayesian optimization.

- **[DiffusionDrive: Truncated Diffusion Model for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15139)**  `arXiv:2411.15139`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Bencheng Liao, Shaoyu Chen, Haoran Yin, Bo Jiang, Cheng Wang, Sixu Yan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, the diffusion model has emerged as a powerful generative technique for robotic policy learning, capable of modeling multi-mode action distributions. Leveraging its capability for end-to-end autonomous driving is a promising direction. However, the numerous denoising steps in the robotic diffusion policy and the more dynamic, open-world nature of traffic scenes pose substantial challenges for generating diverse driving actions at a real-time speed. To address these challenges, we propose a novel truncated diffusion policy that incorporates prior multi-mode anchors and truncates the diffusion schedule, enabling the model to learn denoising from anchored Gaussian distribution to the multi-mode driving action distribution. Additionally, we design an efficient cascade diffusion decoder for enhanced interaction with conditional scene context. The proposed model, DiffusionDrive, demonstrates 10$\times$ reduction in denoising steps compared to vanilla diffusion policy, delivering superior diversity and quality in just 2 steps. On the planning-oriented NAVSIM dataset, with the aligned ResNet-34 backbone, DiffusionDrive achieves 88.1 PDMS without bells and whistles, setting a new record, while running at a real-time speed of 45 FPS on an NVIDIA 4090. Qualitative results on challenging scenarios further confirm that DiffusionDrive can robustly generate diverse plausible driving actions. Code and model will be available atthis https URL.

- **[Geo4D: Leveraging Video Generators for Geometric 4D Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07961)**  `arXiv:2504.07961`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zeren Jiang, Chuanxia Zheng, Iro Laina, Diane Larlus, Andrea Vedaldi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Geo4D, a method to repurpose video diffusion models for monocular 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes. By leveraging the strong dynamic prior captured by such video models, Geo4D can be trained using only synthetic data while generalizing well to real data in a zero-shot manner. Geo4D predicts several complementary geometric modalities, namely point, depth, and ray maps. It uses a new multi-modal alignment algorithm to align and fuse these modalities, as well as multiple sliding windows, at inference time, thus obtaining robust and accurate 4D reconstruction of long videos. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Geo4D significantly surpasses state-of-the-art video depth estimation methods, including recent methods such as MonST3R, which are also designed to handle dynamic scenes.

- **[InteractAvatar: Modeling Hand-Face Interaction in Photorealistic Avatars with Deformable Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07949)**  `arXiv:2504.07949`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kefan Chen, Sergiu Oprea, Justin Theiss, Sreyas Mohan, Srinath Sridhar, Aayush Prakash_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rising interest from the community in digital avatars coupled with the importance of expressions and gestures in communication, modeling natural avatar behavior remains an important challenge across many industries such as teleconferencing, gaming, and AR/VR. Human hands are the primary tool for interacting with the environment and essential for realistic human behavior modeling, yet existing 3D hand and head avatar models often overlook the crucial aspect of hand-body interactions, such as between hand and face. We present InteracttAvatar, the first model to faithfully capture the photorealistic appearance of dynamic hand and non-rigid hand-face interactions. Our novel Dynamic Gaussian Hand model, combining template model and 3D Gaussian Splatting as well as a dynamic refinement module, captures pose-dependent change, e.g. the fine wrinkles and complex shadows that occur during articulation. Importantly, our hand-face interaction module models the subtle geometry and appearance dynamics that underlie common gestures. Through experiments of novel view synthesis, self reenactment and cross-identity reenactment, we demonstrate that InteracttAvatar can reconstruct hand and hand-face interactions from monocular or multiview videos with high-fidelity details and be animated with novel poses.

- **[V2V3D: View-to-View Denoised 3D Reconstruction for Light-Field Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07853)**  `arXiv:2504.07853`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jiayin Zhao, Zhenqi Fu, Tao Yu, Hui Qiao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Light field microscopy (LFM) has gained significant attention due to its ability to capture snapshot-based, large-scale 3D fluorescence images. However, existing LFM reconstruction algorithms are highly sensitive to sensor noise or require hard-to-get ground-truth annotated data for training. To address these challenges, this paper introduces V2V3D, an unsupervised view2view-based framework that establishes a new paradigm for joint optimization of image denoising and 3D reconstruction in a unified architecture. We assume that the LF images are derived from a consistent 3D signal, with the noise in each view being independent. This enables V2V3D to incorporate the principle of noise2noise for effective denoising. To enhance the recovery of high-frequency details, we propose a novel wave-optics-based feature alignment technique, which transforms the point spread function, used for forward propagation in wave optics, into convolution kernels specifically designed for feature alignment. Moreover, we introduce an LFM dataset containing LF images and their corresponding 3D intensity volumes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves high computational efficiency and outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods. These advancements position V2V3D as a promising solution for 3D imaging under challenging conditions.

- **[S2R-HDR: A Large-Scale Rendered Dataset for HDR Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07667)**  `arXiv:2504.07667`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yujin Wang, Jiarui Wu, Yichen Bian, Fan Zhang, Tianfan Xue_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The generalization of learning-based high dynamic range (HDR) fusion is often limited by the availability of training data, as collecting large-scale HDR images from dynamic scenes is both costly and technically challenging. To address these challenges, we propose S2R-HDR, the first large-scale high-quality synthetic dataset for HDR fusion, with 24,000 HDR samples. Using Unreal Engine 5, we design a diverse set of realistic HDR scenes that encompass various dynamic elements, motion types, high dynamic range scenes, and lighting. Additionally, we develop an efficient rendering pipeline to generate realistic HDR images. To further mitigate the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, we introduce S2R-Adapter, a domain adaptation designed to bridge this gap and enhance the generalization ability of models. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art HDR reconstruction performance. Dataset and code will be available atthis https URL.

- **[STeP: A General and Scalable Framework for Solving Video Inverse Problems with Spatiotemporal Diffusion Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07549)**  `arXiv:2504.07549`  `cs.CV`  
  _Bingliang Zhang, Zihui Wu, Berthy T. Feng, Yang Song, Yisong Yue, Katherine L. Bouman_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study how to solve general Bayesian inverse problems involving videos using diffusion model priors. While it is desirable to use a video diffusion prior to effectively capture complex temporal relationships, due to the computational and data requirements of training such a model, prior work has instead relied on image diffusion priors on single frames combined with heuristics to enforce temporal consistency. However, these approaches struggle with faithfully recovering the underlying temporal relationships, particularly for tasks with high temporal uncertainty. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of practical and accessible spatiotemporal diffusion priors by fine-tuning latent video diffusion models from pretrained image diffusion models using limited videos in specific domains. Leveraging this plug-and-play spatiotemporal diffusion prior, we introduce a general and scalable framework for solving video inverse problems. We then apply our framework to two challenging scientific video inverse problems--black hole imaging and dynamic MRI. Our framework enables the generation of diverse, high-fidelity video reconstructions that not only fit observations but also recover multi-modal solutions. By incorporating a spatiotemporal diffusion prior, we significantly improve our ability to capture complex temporal relationships in the data while also enhancing spatial fidelity.

- **[Event Signal Filtering via Probability Flux Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07503)**  `arXiv:2504.07503`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jinze Chen, Wei Zhai, Yang Cao, Bin Li, Zheng-Jun Zha_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Events offer a novel paradigm for capturing scene dynamics via asynchronous sensing, but their inherent randomness often leads to degraded signal quality. Event signal filtering is thus essential for enhancing fidelity by reducing this internal randomness and ensuring consistent outputs across diverse acquisition conditions. Unlike traditional time series that rely on fixed temporal sampling to capture steady-state behaviors, events encode transient dynamics through polarity and event intervals, making signal modeling significantly more complex. To address this, the theoretical foundation of event generation is revisited through the lens of diffusion processes. The state and process information within events is modeled as continuous probability flux at threshold boundaries of the underlying irradiance diffusion. Building on this insight, a generative, online filtering framework called Event Density Flow Filter (EDFilter) is introduced. EDFilter estimates event correlation by reconstructing the continuous probability flux from discrete events using nonparametric kernel smoothing, and then resamples filtered events from this flux. To optimize fidelity over time, spatial and temporal kernels are employed in a time-varying optimization framework. A fast recursive solver with O(1) complexity is proposed, leveraging state-space models and lookup tables for efficient likelihood computation. Furthermore, a new real-world benchmark Rotary Event Dataset (RED) is released, offering microsecond-level ground truth irradiance for full-reference event filtering evaluation. Extensive experiments validate EDFilter's performance across tasks like event filtering, super-resolution, and direct event-based blob tracking. Significant gains in downstream applications such as SLAM and video reconstruction underscore its robustness and effectiveness.

- **[Model Discrepancy Learning: Synthetic Faces Detection Based on Multi-Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07382)**  `arXiv:2504.07382`  `cs.CV`  
  _Qingchao Jiang, Zhishuo Xu, Zhiying Zhu, Ning Chen, Haoyue Wang, Zhongjie Ba_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advances in image generation enable hyper-realistic synthetic faces but also pose risks, thus making synthetic face detection crucial. Previous research focuses on the general differences between generated images and real images, often overlooking the discrepancies among various generative techniques. In this paper, we explore the intrinsic relationship between synthetic images and their corresponding generation technologies. We find that specific images exhibit significant reconstruction discrepancies across different generative methods and that matching generation techniques provide more accurate reconstructions. Based on this insight, we propose a Multi-Reconstruction-based detector. By reversing and reconstructing images using multiple generative models, we analyze the reconstruction differences among real, GAN-generated, and DM-generated images to facilitate effective differentiation. Additionally, we introduce the Asian Synthetic Face Dataset (ASFD), containing synthetic Asian faces generated with various GANs and DMs. This dataset complements existing synthetic face datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our detector achieves exceptional performance, with strong generalization and robustness.

- **[View-Dependent Uncertainty Estimation of 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07370)**  `arXiv:2504.07370`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chenyu Han, Corentin Dumery_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become increasingly popular in 3D scene reconstruction for its high visual accuracy. However, uncertainty estimation of 3DGS scenes remains underexplored and is crucial to downstream tasks such as asset extraction and scene completion. Since the appearance of 3D gaussians is view-dependent, the color of a gaussian can thus be certain from an angle and uncertain from another. We thus propose to model uncertainty in 3DGS as an additional view-dependent per-gaussian feature that can be modeled with spherical harmonics. This simple yet effective modeling is easily interpretable and can be integrated into the traditional 3DGS pipeline. It is also significantly faster than ensemble methods while maintaining high accuracy, as demonstrated in our experiments.

- **[CEC-MMR: Cross-Entropy Clustering Approach to Multi-Modal Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07301)**  `arXiv:2504.07301`  `cs.CV`  
  _Krzysztof Byrski, Jacek Tabor, Przemys≈Çaw Spurek, Marcin Mazur_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In practical applications of regression analysis, it is not uncommon to encounter a multitude of values for each attribute. In such a situation, the univariate distribution, which is typically Gaussian, is suboptimal because the mean may be situated between modes, resulting in a predicted value that differs significantly from the actual data. Consequently, to address this issue, a mixture distribution with parameters learned by a neural network, known as a Mixture Density Network (MDN), is typically employed. However, this approach has an important inherent limitation, in that it is not feasible to ascertain the precise number of components with a reasonable degree of accuracy. In this paper, we introduce CEC-MMR, a novel approach based on Cross-Entropy Clustering (CEC), which allows for the automatic detection of the number of components in a regression problem. Furthermore, given an attribute and its value, our method is capable of uniquely identifying it with the underlying component. The experimental results demonstrate that CEC-MMR yields superior outcomes compared to classical MDNs.

- **[Survey on Monocular Metric Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11841)**  `arXiv:2501.11841`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a core task in computer vision that enables spatial understanding, 3D reconstruction, and autonomous navigation. Deep learning methods typically estimate relative depth from a single image, but the lack of metric scale often leads to geometric inconsistencies. This limitation severely impacts applications such as visual SLAM, detailed 3D modeling, and novel view synthesis. Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) addresses this issue by producing depth maps with absolute scale, ensuring frame-to-frame consistency and supporting direct deployment without scale calibration. This paper presents a structured survey of depth estimation methods, tracing the evolution from traditional geometry-based approaches to modern deep learning models. Recent progress in MMDE is analyzed, with a focus on two key challenges: poor generalization and blurred object boundaries. To tackle these problems, researchers have explored various strategies, including self-supervised learning with unlabeled data, patch-based training, architectural enhancements, and generative model integration. Each method is discussed in terms of technical contribution, performance improvement, and remaining limitations. The survey consolidates recent findings, identifies unresolved challenges, and outlines future directions for MMDE. By highlighting key advancements and open problems, this paper aims to support the continued development and real-world adoption of metric depth estimation in computer vision.

- **[GSDeformer: Direct, Real-time and Extensible Cage-based Deformation for 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15491)**  `arXiv:2405.15491`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jiajun Huang, Shuolin Xu, Hongchuan Yu, Tong-Yee Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present GSDeformer, a method that enables cage-based deformation on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach bridges cage-based deformation and 3DGS by using a proxy point-cloud representation. This point cloud is generated from 3D Gaussians, and deformations applied to the point cloud are translated into transformations on the 3D Gaussians. To handle potential bending caused by deformation, we incorporate a splitting process to approximate it. Our method does not modify or extend the core architecture of 3D Gaussian Splatting, making it compatible with any trained vanilla 3DGS or its variants. Additionally, we automate cage construction for 3DGS and its variants using a render-and-reconstruct approach. Experiments demonstrate that GSDeformer delivers superior deformation results compared to existing methods, is robust under extreme deformations, requires no retraining for editing, runs in real-time, and can be extended to other 3DGS variants.

- **[Rethinking Patch Dependence for Masked Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14391)**  `arXiv:2401.14391`  `cs.CV`  
  _Letian Fu, Long Lian, Renhao Wang, Baifeng Shi, Xudong Wang, Adam Yala, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we examine the impact of inter-patch dependencies in the decoder of masked autoencoders (MAE) on representation learning. We decompose the decoding mechanism for masked reconstruction into self-attention between mask tokens and cross-attention between masked and visible tokens. Our findings reveal that MAE reconstructs coherent images from visible patches not through interactions between patches in the decoder but by learning a global representation within the encoder. This discovery leads us to propose a simple visual pretraining framework: cross-attention masked autoencoders (CrossMAE). This framework employs only cross-attention in the decoder to independently read out reconstructions for a small subset of masked patches from encoder outputs. This approach achieves comparable or superior performance to traditional MAE across models ranging from ViT-S to ViT-H and significantly reduces computational requirements. By its design, CrossMAE challenges the necessity of interaction between mask tokens for effective masked pretraining. Code and models are publicly available:this https URL
