- **[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Discrete-Time Gaussian Process Mixtures for Robot Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03296)**  `arXiv:2505.03296`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  We present Mixture of Discrete-time Gaussian Processes (MiDiGap), a novel approach for flexible policy representation and imitation learning in robot manipulation. MiDiGap enables learning from as few as five demonstrations using only camera observations and generalizes across a wide range of challenging tasks. It excels at long-horizon behaviors such as making coffee, highly constrained motions such as opening doors, dynamic actions such as scooping with a spatula, and multimodal tasks such as hanging a mug. MiDiGap learns these tasks on a CPU in less than a minute and scales linearly to large datasets. We also develop a rich suite of tools for inference-time steering using evidence such as collision signals and robot kinematic constraints. This steering enables novel generalization capabilities, including obstacle avoidance and cross-embodiment policy transfer. MiDiGap achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse few-shot manipulation benchmarks. On constrained RLBench tasks, it improves policy success by 76 percentage points and reduces trajectory cost by 67%. On multimodal tasks, it improves policy success by 48 percentage points and increases sample efficiency by a factor of 20. In cross-embodiment transfer, it more than doubles policy success. We make the code publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[Task Reconstruction and Extrapolation for $œÄ_0$ using Text Latent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03500)**  `arXiv:2505.03500`  `cs.RO`

  Vision-language-action models (VLAs) often achieve high performance on demonstrated tasks but struggle significantly when required to extrapolate, combining skills learned from different tasks in novel ways. For instance, VLAs might successfully put the cream cheese in the bowl and put the bowl on top of the cabinet, yet still fail to put the cream cheese on top of the cabinet. In this work, we demonstrate that behaviors from distinct tasks can be effectively recombined by manipulating the VLA's internal representations at inference time. Concretely, we identify the text latent by averaging the text tokens' hidden states across all demonstrated trajectories for a specific base task. For executing an extrapolated task, we can temporally interpolate the text latent of the two base tasks and add it back to the text hidden states, so sub-behaviors from the two tasks will be activated sequentially. We evaluate this approach using the newly created libero-ood benchmark, featuring 20 tasks extrapolated from standard LIBERO suites. The results on libero-ood show that all SOTA VLAs achieve < 15% success rate, while $\pi0$ with text latent interpolation reaches an 83% success rate. Further qualitative analysis reveals a tendency for VLAs to exhibit spatial overfitting, mapping object names to demonstrated locations rather than achieving genuine object and goal understanding. Additionally, we find that decoding the text latent yields human-unreadable prompts that can nevertheless instruct the VLA to achieve a 70% success rate on standard LIBERO suites, enabling private instruction or backdoor attacks.

- **[AquaticVision: Benchmarking Visual SLAM in Underwater Environment with Events and Frames](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03448)**  `arXiv:2505.03448`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yifan Peng, Yuze Hong, Ziyang Hong, Apple Pui-Yi Chui, Junfeng Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many underwater applications, such as offshore asset inspections, rely on visual inspection and detailed 3D reconstruction. Recent advancements in underwater visual SLAM systems for aquatic environments have garnered significant attention in marine robotics research. However, existing underwater visual SLAM datasets often lack groundtruth trajectory data, making it difficult to objectively compare the performance of different SLAM algorithms based solely on qualitative results or COLMAP reconstruction. In this paper, we present a novel underwater dataset that includes ground truth trajectory data obtained using a motion capture system. Additionally, for the first time, we release visual data that includes both events and frames for benchmarking underwater visual positioning. By providing event camera data, we aim to facilitate the development of more robust and advanced underwater visual SLAM algorithms. The use of event cameras can help mitigate challenges posed by extremely low light or hazy underwater conditions. The webpage of our dataset isthis https URL.

- **[Towards Uncertainty Unification: A Case Study for Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19317)**  `arXiv:2503.19317`  `cs.RO`  
  _Shaoting Peng, Haonan Chen, Katherine Driggs-Campbell_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning human preferences is essential for human-robot interaction, as it enables robots to adapt their behaviors to align with human expectations and goals. However, the inherent uncertainties in both human behavior and robotic systems make preference learning a challenging task. While probabilistic robotics algorithms offer uncertainty quantification, the integration of human preference uncertainty remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce uncertainty unification and propose a novel framework, uncertainty-unified preference learning (UUPL), which enhances Gaussian Process (GP)-based preference learning by unifying human and robot uncertainties. Specifically, UUPL includes a human preference uncertainty model that improves GP posterior mean estimation, and an uncertainty-weighted Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) that enhances GP predictive variance accuracy. Additionally, we design a user-specific calibration process to align uncertainty representations across users, ensuring consistency and reliability in the model performance. Comprehensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that UUPL achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction accuracy and user rating. An ablation study further validates the effectiveness of human uncertainty model and uncertainty-weighted GMM of UUPL.

  _Shangzhe Li, Zhiao Huang, Hao Su_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imitation learning (IL) enables agents to acquire skills directly from expert demonstrations, providing a compelling alternative to reinforcement learning. However, prior online IL approaches struggle with complex tasks characterized by high-dimensional inputs and complex dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel approach to online imitation learning that leverages reward-free world models. Our method learns environmental dynamics entirely in latent spaces without reconstruction, enabling efficient and accurate modeling. We adopt the inverse soft-Q learning objective, reformulating the optimization process in the Q-policy space to mitigate the instability associated with traditional optimization in the reward-policy space. By employing a learned latent dynamics model and planning for control, our approach consistently achieves stable, expert-level performance in tasks with high-dimensional observation or action spaces and intricate dynamics. We evaluate our method on a diverse set of benchmarks, including DMControl, MyoSuite, and ManiSkill2, demonstrating superior empirical performance compared to existing approaches.

- **[Optimization of Module Transferability in Single Image Super-Resolution: Universality Assessment and Cycle Residual Blocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03522)**  `arXiv:2505.03522`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Haotong Cheng, Zhiqi Zhang, Hao Li, Xinshang Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning has substantially advanced the Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). However, existing researches have predominantly focused on raw performance gains, with little attention paid to quantifying the transferability of architectural components. In this paper, we introduce the concept of "Universality" and its associated definitions which extend the traditional notion of "Generalization" to encompass the modules' ease of transferability, thus revealing the relationships between module universality and model generalizability. Then we propose the Universality Assessment Equation (UAE), a metric for quantifying how readily a given module could be transplanted across models. Guided by the UAE results of standard residual blocks and other plug-and-play modules, we further design two optimized modules, Cycle Residual Block (CRB) and Depth-Wise Cycle Residual Block (DCRB). Through comprehensive experiments on natural-scene benchmarks, remote-sensing datasets, extreme-industrial imagery and on-device deployments, we demonstrate that networks embedded with the proposed plug-and-play modules outperform several state-of-the-arts, reaching a PSNR enhancement of up to 0.83dB or enabling a 71.3% reduction in parameters with negligible loss in reconstruction fidelity.

- **[Motion-compensated cardiac MRI using low-rank diffeomorphic flow (DMoCo)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03149)**  `arXiv:2505.03149`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Joseph William Kettelkamp, Ludovica Romanin, Sarv Priya, Mathews Jacob_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce an unsupervised motion-compensated image reconstruction algorithm for free-breathing and ungated 3D cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We express the image volume corresponding to each specific motion phase as the deformation of a single static image template. The main contribution of the work is the low-rank model for the compact joint representation of the family of diffeomorphisms, parameterized by the motion phases. The diffeomorphism at a specific motion phase is obtained by integrating a parametric velocity field along a path connecting the reference template phase to the motion phase. The velocity field at different phases is represented using a low-rank model. The static template and the low-rank motion model parameters are learned directly from the k-space data in an unsupervised fashion. The more constrained motion model is observed to offer improved recovery compared to current motion-resolved and motion-compensated algorithms for free-breathing 3D cine MRI.

- **[Lesion-Aware Generative Artificial Intelligence for Virtual Contrast-Enhanced Mammography in Breast Cancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03018)**  `arXiv:2505.03018`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) is a dual-energy mammographic technique that improves lesion visibility through the administration of an iodinated contrast agent. It acquires both a low-energy image, comparable to standard mammography, and a high-energy image, which are then combined to produce a dual-energy subtracted image highlighting lesion contrast enhancement. While CESM offers superior diagnostic accuracy compared to standard mammography, its use entails higher radiation exposure and potential side effects associated with the contrast medium. To address these limitations, we propose Seg-CycleGAN, a generative deep learning framework for Virtual Contrast Enhancement in CESM. The model synthesizes high-fidelity dual-energy subtracted images from low-energy images, leveraging lesion segmentation maps to guide the generative process and improve lesion reconstruction. Building upon the standard CycleGAN architecture, Seg-CycleGAN introduces localized loss terms focused on lesion areas, enhancing the synthesis of diagnostically relevant regions. Experiments on the CESM@UCBM dataset demonstrate that Seg-CycleGAN outperforms the baseline in terms of PSNR and SSIM, while maintaining competitive MSE and VIF. Qualitative evaluations further confirm improved lesion fidelity in the generated images. These results suggest that segmentation-aware generative models offer a viable pathway toward contrast-free CESM alternatives.

- **[Towards A Robust Group-level Emotion Recognition via Uncertainty-Aware Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04306)**  `arXiv:2310.04306`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Qing Zhu, Qirong Mao, Jialin Zhang, Xiaohua Huang, Wenming Zheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Group-level emotion recognition (GER) is an inseparable part of human behavior analysis, aiming to recognize an overall emotion in a multi-person scene. However, the existing methods are devoted to combing diverse emotion cues while ignoring the inherent uncertainties under unconstrained environments, such as congestion and occlusion occurring within a group. Additionally, since only group-level labels are available, inconsistent emotion predictions among individuals in one group can confuse the network. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware learning (UAL) method to extract more robust representations for GER. By explicitly modeling the uncertainty of each individual, we utilize stochastic embedding drawn from a Gaussian distribution instead of deterministic point embedding. This representation captures the probabilities of different emotions and generates diverse predictions through this stochasticity during the inference stage. Furthermore, uncertainty-sensitive scores are adaptively assigned as the fusion weights of individuals' face within each group. Moreover, we develop an image enhancement module to enhance the model's robustness against severe noise. The overall three-branch model, encompassing face, object, and scene component, is guided by a proportional-weighted fusion strategy and integrates the proposed uncertainty-aware method to produce the final group-level output. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method across three widely used databases.

- **[Distribution-Conditional Generation: From Class Distribution to Creative Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03667)**  `arXiv:2505.03667`  `cs.CV`  
  _Fu Feng, Yucheng Xie, Xu Yang, Jing Wang, Xin Geng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models are effective at producing semantically aligned images, but their reliance on training data distributions limits their ability to synthesize truly novel, out-of-distribution concepts. Existing methods typically enhance creativity by combining pairs of known concepts, yielding compositions that, while out-of-distribution, remain linguistically describable and bounded within the existing semantic space. Inspired by the soft probabilistic outputs of classifiers on ambiguous inputs, we propose Distribution-Conditional Generation, a novel formulation that models creativity as image synthesis conditioned on class distributions, enabling semantically unconstrained creative generation. Building on this, we propose DisTok, an encoder-decoder framework that maps class distributions into a latent space and decodes them into tokens of creative concept. DisTok maintains a dynamic concept pool and iteratively sampling and fusing concept pairs, enabling the generation of tokens aligned with increasingly complex class distributions. To enforce distributional consistency, latent vectors sampled from a Gaussian prior are decoded into tokens and rendered into images, whose class distributions-predicted by a vision-language model-supervise the alignment between input distributions and the visual semantics of generated tokens. The resulting tokens are added to the concept pool for subsequent composition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DisTok, by unifying distribution-conditioned fusion and sampling-based synthesis, enables efficient and flexible token-level generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with superior text-image alignment and human preference scores.

  Deep learning-based medical image-to-mesh reconstruction has rapidly evolved, enabling the transformation of medical imaging data into three-dimensional mesh models that are critical in computational medicine and in silico trials for advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms, and diagnostic and therapeutic techniques in modern medicine. This survey systematically categorizes existing approaches into four main categories: template models, statistical models, generative models, and implicit models. Each category is analysed in detail, examining their methodological foundations, strengths, limitations, and applicability to different anatomical structures and imaging modalities. We provide an extensive evaluation of these methods across various anatomical applications, from cardiac imaging to neurological studies, supported by quantitative comparisons using standard metrics. Additionally, we compile and analyze major public datasets available for medical mesh reconstruction tasks and discuss commonly used evaluation metrics and loss functions. The survey identifies current challenges in the field, including requirements for topological correctness, geometric accuracy, and multi-modality integration. Finally, we present promising future research directions in this domain. This systematic review aims to serve as a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners in medical image analysis and computational medicine.

  _Sun Haoxuan, Hong Yan, Zhan Jiahui, Chen Haoxing, Lan Jun, Zhu Huijia, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of generative image technology has introduced significant security concerns, particularly in the domain of face generation detection. This paper investigates the vulnerabilities of current AI-generated face detection systems. Our study reveals that while existing detection methods often achieve high accuracy under standard conditions, they exhibit limited robustness against adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that integrates adversarial training to mitigate the impact of adversarial examples. Furthermore, we utilize diffusion inversion and reconstruction to further enhance detection robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that minor adversarial perturbations can easily bypass existing detection systems, but our method significantly improves the robustness of these systems. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of adversarial and benign examples, offering insights into the intrinsic characteristics of AI-generated content. All associated code will be made publicly available in a dedicated repository to facilitate further research and verification.

- **[A Fusion-Guided Inception Network for Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03431)**  `arXiv:2505.03431`  `cs.CV`  
  _Usman Muhammad, Jorma Laaksonen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The fusion of low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HSIs) with high-spatial-resolution conventional images (e.g., panchromatic or RGB) has played a significant role in recent advancements in HSI super-resolution. However, this fusion process relies on the availability of precise alignment between image pairs, which is often challenging in real-world scenarios. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a single-image super-resolution model called the Fusion-Guided Inception Network (FGIN). Specifically, we first employ a spectral-spatial fusion module to effectively integrate spectral and spatial information at an early stage. Next, an Inception-like hierarchical feature extraction strategy is used to capture multiscale spatial dependencies, followed by a dedicated multi-scale fusion block. To further enhance reconstruction quality, we incorporate an optimized upsampling module that combines bilinear interpolation with depthwise separable convolutions. Experimental evaluations on two publicly available hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our method.

  _Haoyu Bai, Jie Wang, Gaomin Li, Xuan Li, Xiaohu Zhang, Xia Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Internal defect detection constitutes a critical process in ensuring component quality, for which anomaly detection serves as an effective solution. However, existing anomaly detection datasets predominantly focus on surface defects in visible-light images, lacking publicly available X-ray datasets targeting internal defects in components. To address this gap, we construct the first publicly accessible component X-ray anomaly detection (CXR-AD) dataset, comprising real-world X-ray images. The dataset covers five industrial component categories, including 653 normal samples and 561 defect samples with precise pixel-level mask annotations. We systematically analyze the dataset characteristics and identify three major technical challenges: (1) strong coupling between complex internal structures and defect regions, (2) inherent low contrast and high noise interference in X-ray imaging, and (3) significant variations in defect scales and morphologies. To evaluate dataset complexity, we benchmark three state-of-the-art anomaly detection frameworks (feature-based, reconstruction-based, and zero-shot learning methods). Experimental results demonstrate a 29.78% average performance degradation on CXR-AD compared to MVTec AD, highlighting the limitations of current algorithms in handling internal defect detection tasks. To the best of our knowledge, CXR-AD represents the first publicly available X-ray dataset for component anomaly detection, providing a real-world industrial benchmark to advance algorithm development and enhance precision in internal defect inspection technologies.

- **[3D Surface Reconstruction with Enhanced High-Frequency Details](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03362)**  `arXiv:2505.03362`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shikun Zhang, Yiqun Wang, Cunjian Chen, Yong Li, Qiuhong Ke_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural implicit 3D reconstruction can reproduce shapes without 3D supervision, and it learns the 3D scene through volume rendering methods and neural implicit representations. Current neural surface reconstruction methods tend to randomly sample the entire image, making it difficult to learn high-frequency details on the surface, and thus the reconstruction results tend to be too smooth. We designed a method (FreNeuS) based on high-frequency information to solve the problem of insufficient surface detail. Specifically, FreNeuS uses pixel gradient changes to easily acquire high-frequency regions in an image and uses the obtained high-frequency information to guide surface detail reconstruction. High-frequency information is first used to guide the dynamic sampling of rays, applying different sampling strategies according to variations in high-frequency regions. To further enhance the focus on surface details, we have designed a high-frequency weighting method that constrains the representation of high-frequency details during the reconstruction process. Qualitative and quantitative results show that our method can reconstruct fine surface details and obtain better surface reconstruction quality compared to existing methods. In addition, our method is more applicable and can be generalized to any NeuS-based work.

  _Dongbin Zhang, Yunfei Liu, Lijian Lin, Ye Zhu, Yang Li, Minghan Qin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing a high-quality, animatable 3D human avatar with expressive facial and hand motions from a single image has gained significant attention due to its broad application potential. 3D human avatar reconstruction typically requires multi-view or monocular videos and training on individual IDs, which is both complex and time-consuming. Furthermore, limited by SMPLX's expressiveness, these methods often focus on body motion but struggle with facial expressions. To address these challenges, we first introduce an expressive human model (EHM) to enhance facial expression capabilities and develop an accurate tracking method. Based on this template model, we propose GUAVA, the first framework for fast animatable upper-body 3D Gaussian avatar reconstruction. We leverage inverse texture mapping and projection sampling techniques to infer Ubody (upper-body) Gaussians from a single image. The rendered images are refined through a neural refiner. Experimental results demonstrate that GUAVA significantly outperforms previous methods in rendering quality and offers significant speed improvements, with reconstruction times in the sub-second range (0.1s), and supports real-time animation and rendering.

- **[3D Gaussian Splatting Data Compression with Mixture of Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03310)**  `arXiv:2505.03310`  `cs.CV`  
  _Lei Liu, Zhenghao Chen, Dong Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) data compression is crucial for enabling efficient storage and transmission in 3D scene modeling. However, its development remains limited due to inadequate entropy models and suboptimal quantization strategies for both lossless and lossy compression scenarios, where existing methods have yet to 1) fully leverage hyperprior information to construct robust conditional entropy models, and 2) apply fine-grained, element-wise quantization strategies for improved compression granularity. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture of Priors (MoP) strategy to simultaneously address these two challenges. Specifically, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, our MoP approach processes hyperprior information through multiple lightweight MLPs to generate diverse prior features, which are subsequently integrated into the MoP feature via a gating mechanism. To enhance lossless compression, the resulting MoP feature is utilized as a hyperprior to improve conditional entropy modeling. Meanwhile, for lossy compression, we employ the MoP feature as guidance information in an element-wise quantization procedure, leveraging a prior-guided Coarse-to-Fine Quantization (C2FQ) strategy with a predefined quantization step value. Specifically, we expand the quantization step value into a matrix and adaptively refine it from coarse to fine granularity, guided by the MoP feature, thereby obtaining a quantization step matrix that facilitates element-wise quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed 3DGS data compression framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including Mip-NeRF360, BungeeNeRF, DeepBlending, and Tank&Temples.

- **[Estimating the Diameter at Breast Height of Trees in a Forest With a Single 360 Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03093)**  `arXiv:2505.03093`  `cs.CV`  
  _Siming He, Zachary Osman, Fernando Cladera, Dexter Ong, Nitant Rai, Patrick Corey Green, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Forest inventories rely on accurate measurements of the diameter at breast height (DBH) for ecological monitoring, resource management, and carbon accounting. While LiDAR-based techniques can achieve centimeter-level precision, they are cost-prohibitive and operationally complex. We present a low-cost alternative that only needs a consumer-grade 360 video camera. Our semi-automated pipeline comprises of (i) a dense point cloud reconstruction using Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry software called Agisoft Metashape, (ii) semantic trunk segmentation by projecting Grounded Segment Anything (SAM) masks onto the 3D cloud, and (iii) a robust RANSAC-based technique to estimate cross section shape and DBH. We introduce an interactive visualization tool for inspecting segmented trees and their estimated DBH. On 61 acquisitions of 43 trees under a variety of conditions, our method attains median absolute relative errors of 5-9% with respect to "ground-truth" manual measurements. This is only 2-4% higher than LiDAR-based estimates, while employing a single 360 camera that costs orders of magnitude less, requires minimal setup, and is widely available.

  _Tian Qiu, Arjun Nichani, Rasta Tadayontahmasebi, Haewon Jeong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural compression methods are gaining popularity due to their superior rate-distortion performance over traditional methods, even at extremely low bitrates below 0.1 bpp. As deep learning architectures, these models are prone to bias during the training process, potentially leading to unfair outcomes for individuals in different groups. In this paper, we present a general, structured, scalable framework for evaluating bias in neural image compression models. Using this framework, we investigate racial bias in neural compression algorithms by analyzing nine popular models and their variants. Through this investigation, we first demonstrate that traditional distortion metrics are ineffective in capturing bias in neural compression models. Next, we highlight that racial bias is present in all neural compression models and can be captured by examining facial phenotype degradation in image reconstructions. We then examine the relationship between bias and realism in the decoded images and demonstrate a trade-off across models. Finally, we show that utilizing a racially balanced training set can reduce bias but is not a sufficient bias mitigation strategy. We additionally show the bias can be attributed to compression model bias and classification model bias. We believe that this work is a first step towards evaluating and eliminating bias in neural image compression models.

  _Mingcheng Li, Xiaolu Hou, Ziyang Liu, Dingkang Yang, Ziyun Qian, Jiawei Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have shown excellent performance in text-to-image generation. Nevertheless, existing methods often suffer from performance bottlenecks when handling complex prompts that involve multiple objects, characteristics, and relations. Therefore, we propose a Multi-agent Collaboration-based Compositional Diffusion (MCCD) for text-to-image generation for complex scenes. Specifically, we design a multi-agent collaboration-based scene parsing module that generates an agent system comprising multiple agents with distinct tasks, utilizing MLLMs to extract various scene elements effectively. In addition, Hierarchical Compositional diffusion utilizes a Gaussian mask and filtering to refine bounding box regions and enhance objects through region enhancement, resulting in the accurate and high-fidelity generation of complex scenes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our MCCD significantly improves the performance of the baseline models in a training-free manner, providing a substantial advantage in complex scene generation.

- **[Decoupling Fine Detail and Global Geometry for Compressed Depth Map Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03239)**  `arXiv:2411.03239`  `cs.CV`  
  _Huan Zheng, Wencheng Han, Jianbing Shen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recovering high-quality depth maps from compressed sources has gained significant attention due to the limitations of consumer-grade depth cameras and the bandwidth restrictions during data transmission. However, current methods still suffer from two challenges. First, bit-depth compression produces a uniform depth representation in regions with subtle variations, hindering the recovery of detailed information. Second, densely distributed random noise reduces the accuracy of estimating the global geometric structure of the scene. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, termed geometry-decoupled network (GDNet), for compressed depth map super-resolution that decouples the high-quality depth map reconstruction process by handling global and detailed geometric features separately. To be specific, we propose the fine geometry detail encoder (FGDE), which is designed to aggregate fine geometry details in high-resolution low-level image features while simultaneously enriching them with complementary information from low-resolution context-level image features. In addition, we develop the global geometry encoder (GGE) that aims at suppressing noise and extracting global geometric information effectively via constructing compact feature representation in a low-rank space. We conduct experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our GDNet significantly outperforms current methods in terms of geometric consistency and detail recovery. In the ECCV 2024 AIM Compressed Depth Upsampling Challenge, our solution won the 1st place award. Our codes are available at:this https URL.

  _Zeqing Xia, Bojun Xiong, Zhouhui Lian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Font design is of vital importance in the digital content design and modern printing industry. Developing algorithms capable of automatically synthesizing vector fonts can significantly facilitate the font design process. However, existing methods mainly concentrate on raster image generation, and only a few approaches can directly synthesize vector fonts. This paper proposes an end-to-end trainable method, VecFontSDF, to reconstruct and synthesize high-quality vector fonts using signed distance functions (SDFs). Specifically, based on the proposed SDF-based implicit shape representation, VecFontSDF learns to model each glyph as shape primitives enclosed by several parabolic curves, which can be precisely converted to quadratic B√©zier curves that are widely used in vector font products. In this manner, most image generation methods can be easily extended to synthesize vector fonts. Qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on a publicly-available dataset demonstrate that our method obtains high-quality results on several tasks, including vector font reconstruction, interpolation, and few-shot vector font synthesis, markedly outperforming the state of the art. Our code and trained models are available atthis https URL.

  Probing learned concepts in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding how semantic knowledge is encoded internally. Training linear classifiers on probing tasks is a principle approach to denote the vector of a certain concept in the representation space. However, the single vector identified for a concept varies with both data and training, making it less robust and weakening its effectiveness in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose an approach to approximate the subspace representing a specific concept. Built on linear probing classifiers, we extend the concept vectors into Gaussian Concept Subspace (GCS). We demonstrate GCS's effectiveness through measuring its faithfulness and plausibility across multiple LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Additionally, we use representation intervention tasks to showcase its efficacy in real-world applications such as emotion steering. Experimental results indicate that GCS concept vectors have the potential to balance steering performance and maintaining the fluency in natural language generation tasks.

  When reading, we often have specific information that interests us in a text. For example, you might be reading this paper because you are curious about LLMs for eye movements in reading, the experimental design, or perhaps you only care about the question ``but does it work?''. More broadly, in daily life, people approach texts with any number of text-specific goals that guide their reading behavior. In this work, we ask, for the first time, whether open-ended reading goals can be automatically decoded from eye movements in reading. To address this question, we introduce goal classification and goal reconstruction tasks and evaluation frameworks, and use large-scale eye tracking for reading data in English with hundreds of text-specific information seeking tasks. We develop and compare several discriminative and generative multimodal LLMs that combine eye movements and text for goal classification and goal reconstruction. Our experiments show considerable success on both tasks, suggesting that LLMs can extract valuable information about the readers' text-specific goals from eye movements.
