  With the increasing complexity of mobile device applications, these devices are evolving toward high agility. This shift imposes new demands on mobile sensing, particularly in achieving high-accuracy and low-latency. Event-based vision has emerged as a disruptive paradigm, offering high temporal resolution and low latency, making it well-suited for high-accuracy and low-latency sensing tasks on high-agility platforms. However, the presence of substantial noisy events, lack of stable, persistent semantic information, and large data volume pose challenges for event-based data processing on resource-constrained mobile devices. This paper surveys the literature from 2014 to 2025 and presents a comprehensive overview of event-based mobile sensing, encompassing its fundamental principles, event \textit{abstraction} methods, \textit{algorithm} advancements, and both hardware and software \textit{acceleration} strategies. We discuss key \textit{applications} of event cameras in mobile sensing, including visual odometry, object tracking, optical flow, and 3D reconstruction, while highlighting challenges associated with event data processing, sensor fusion, and real-time deployment. Furthermore, we outline future research directions, such as improving the event camera with advanced optics, leveraging neuromorphic computing for efficient processing, and integrating bio-inspired algorithms. To support ongoing research, we provide an open-source \textit{Online Sheet} with recent developments. We hope this survey serves as a reference, facilitating the adoption of event-based vision across diverse applications.

- **[Calib3R: A 3D Foundation Model for Multi-Camera to Robot Calibration and 3D Metric-Scaled Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08813)**  `arXiv:2509.08813`  `cs.RO`

  Robots often rely on RGB images for tasks like manipulation and navigation. However, reliable interaction typically requires a 3D scene representation that is metric-scaled and aligned with the robot reference frame. This depends on accurate camera-to-robot calibration and dense 3D reconstruction, tasks usually treated separately, despite both relying on geometric correspondences from RGB data. Traditional calibration needs patterns, while RGB-based reconstruction yields geometry with an unknown scale in an arbitrary frame. Multi-camera setups add further complexity, as data must be expressed in a shared reference frame. We present Calib3R, a patternless method that jointly performs camera-to-robot calibration and metric-scaled 3D reconstruction via unified optimization. Calib3R handles single- and multi-camera setups on robot arms or mobile robots. It builds on the 3D foundation model MASt3R to extract pointmaps from RGB images, which are combined with robot poses to reconstruct a scaled 3D scene aligned with the robot. Experiments on diverse datasets show that Calib3R achieves accurate calibration with less than 10 images, outperforming target-less and marker-based methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  PySensors is a Python package for selecting and placing a sparse set of sensors for reconstruction and classification tasks. In this major update to \texttt{PySensors}, we introduce spatially constrained sensor placement capabilities, allowing users to enforce constraints such as maximum or exact sensor counts in specific regions, incorporate predetermined sensor locations, and maintain minimum distances between sensors. We extend functionality to support custom basis inputs, enabling integration of any data-driven or spectral basis. We also propose a thermodynamic approach that goes beyond a single ``optimal'' sensor configuration and maps the complete landscape of sensor interactions induced by the training data. This comprehensive view facilitates integration with external selection criteria and enables assessment of sensor replacement impacts. The new optimization technique also accounts for over- and under-sampling of sensors, utilizing a regularized least squares approach for robust reconstruction. Additionally, we incorporate noise-induced uncertainty quantification of the estimation error and provide visual uncertainty heat maps to guide deployment decisions. To highlight these additions, we provide a brief description of the mathematical algorithms and theory underlying these new capabilities. We demonstrate the usage of new features with illustrative code examples and include practical advice for implementation across various application domains. Finally, we outline a roadmap of potential extensions to further enhance the package's functionality and applicability to emerging sensing challenges.

- **[Variational Rank Reduction Autoencoders for Generative](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08515)**  `arXiv:2509.08515`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative thermal design for complex geometries is fundamental in many areas of engineering, yet it faces two main challenges: the high computational cost of high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional generative models. Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which restricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent solutions.To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space, leading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that mitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet then exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with spatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients efficiently and accurately.This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries and the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial advantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers. Overall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent representations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining generative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader engineering applications.

- **[Moment- and Power-Spectrum-Based Gaussianity Regularization for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07027)**  `arXiv:2509.07027`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity, encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates convergence.

- **[APML: Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss for Robust 3D Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08104)**  `arXiv:2509.08104`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape completion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences, leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance (EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN, FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC) that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without additional hyperparameter search.

- **[SAFT: Shape and Appearance of Fabrics from Template via Differentiable Physical Simulations from Monocular Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08828)**  `arXiv:2509.08828`  `cs.CV`  
  _David Stotko, Reinhard Klein_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene. Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from this single monocular RGB video.

- **[EVDI++: Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation via Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08260)**  `arXiv:2509.08260`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Frame-based cameras with extended exposure times often produce perceptible visual blurring and information loss between frames, significantly degrading video quality. To address this challenge, we introduce EVDI++, a unified self-supervised framework for Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

- **[VIM-GS: Visual-Inertial Monocular Gaussian Splatting via Object-level Guidance in Large Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06685)**  `arXiv:2509.06685`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shengkai Zhang, Yuhe Liu, Guanjun Wu, Jianhua He, Xinggang Wang, Mozi Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes. Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency, inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output, we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.
