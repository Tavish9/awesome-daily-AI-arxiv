- **[Mask and Restore: Blind Backdoor Defense at Test Time with Masked Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15564)**  `arXiv:2303.15564`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Tao Sun, Lu Pang, Weimin Lyu, Chao Chen, Haibin Ling_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an adversary manipulates the model behavior through overlaying images with special triggers. Existing backdoor defense methods often require accessing a few validation data and model parameters, which is impractical in many real-world applications, e.g., when the model is provided as a cloud service. In this paper, we address the practical task of blind backdoor defense at test time, in particular for local attacks and black-box models. The true label of every test image needs to be recovered on the fly from a suspicious model regardless of image benignity. We consider test-time image purification that incapacitates local triggers while keeping semantic contents intact. Due to diverse trigger patterns and sizes, the heuristic trigger search can be unscalable. We circumvent such barrier by leveraging the strong reconstruction power of generative models, and propose Blind Defense with Masked AutoEncoder (BDMAE). BDMAE detects possible local triggers using image structural similarity and label consistency between the test image and MAE restorations. The detection results are then refined by considering trigger topology. Finally, we fuse MAE restorations adaptively into a purified image for making prediction. Extensive experiments under different backdoor settings validate its effectiveness and generalizability.

- **[Categorical Policies: Multimodal Policy Learning and Exploration in Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13922)**  `arXiv:2508.13922`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _SM Mazharul Islam, Manfred Huber_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone, limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.

- **[Robust Federated Learning under Adversarial Attacks via Loss-Based Client Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12672)**  `arXiv:2508.12672`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Emmanouil Kritharakis, Dusan Jakovetic, Antonios Makris, Konstantinos Tserpes_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing private data. We consider FL scenarios wherein FL clients are subject to adversarial (Byzantine) attacks, while the FL server is trusted (honest) and has a trustworthy side dataset. This may correspond to, e.g., cases where the server possesses trusted data prior to federation, or to the presence of a trusted client that temporarily assumes the server role. Our approach requires only two honest participants, i.e., the server and one client, to function effectively, without prior knowledge of the number of malicious clients. Theoretical analysis demonstrates bounded optimality gaps even under strong Byzantine attacks. Experimental results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms standard and robust FL baselines such as Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum under various attack strategies including label flipping, sign flipping, and Gaussian noise addition across MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 benchmarks using the Flower framework.

- **[Bidirectional Information Flow (BIF) -- A Sample Efficient Hierarchical Gaussian Process for Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11294)**  `arXiv:2505.11294`  `cs.LG`  
  _Juan D. Guerra, Thomas Garbay, Guillaume Lajoie, Marco Bonizzato_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hierarchical Gaussian Process (H-GP) models divide problems into different subtasks, allowing for different models to address each part, making them well-suited for problems with inherent hierarchical structure. However, typical H-GP models do not fully take advantage of this structure, only sending information up or down the hierarchy. This one-way coupling limits sample efficiency and slows convergence. We propose Bidirectional Information Flow (BIF), an efficient H-GP framework that establishes bidirectional information exchange between parent and child models in H-GPs for online training. BIF retains the modular structure of hierarchical models - the parent combines subtask knowledge from children GPs - while introducing top-down feedback to continually refine children models during online learning. This mutual exchange improves sample efficiency, enables robust training, and allows modular reuse of learned subtask models. BIF outperforms conventional H-GP Bayesian Optimization methods, achieving up to 4x and 3x higher $R^2$ scores for the parent and children respectively, on synthetic and real-world neurostimulation optimization tasks.

- **[A Causal Graph-Enhanced Gaussian Process Regression for Modeling Engine-out NOx](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18424)**  `arXiv:2410.18424`  `cs.LG`  
  _Shrenik Zinage, Ilias Bilionis, Peter Meckl_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The stringent regulatory requirements on nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from diesel compression ignition engines require accurate and reliable models for real-time monitoring and diagnostics. Although traditional methods such as physical sensors and virtual engine control module (ECM) sensors provide essential data, they are only used for estimation. Ubiquitous literature primarily focuses on deterministic models with little emphasis on capturing the various uncertainties. The lack of probabilistic frameworks restricts the applicability of these models for robust diagnostics. The objective of this paper is to develop and validate a probabilistic model to predict engine-out NOx emissions using Gaussian process regression. Our approach is as follows. We employ three variants of Gaussian process models: the first with a standard radial basis function kernel with input window, the second incorporating a deep kernel using convolutional neural networks to capture temporal dependencies, and the third enriching the deep kernel with a causal graph derived via graph convolutional networks. The causal graph embeds physics knowledge into the learning process. All models are compared against a virtual ECM sensor using both quantitative and qualitative metrics. We conclude that our model provides an improvement in predictive performance when using an input window and a deep kernel structure. Even more compelling is the further enhancement achieved by the incorporation of a causal graph into the deep kernel. These findings are corroborated across different verification and validation datasets.

- **[MCN-SLAM: Multi-Agent Collaborative Neural SLAM with Hybrid Implicit Neural Scene Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18678)**  `arXiv:2506.18678`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Tianchen Deng, Guole Shen, Xun Chen, Shenghai Yuan, Hongming Shen, Guohao Peng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown promising results in dense visual SLAM. However, existing implicit SLAM algorithms are constrained to single-agent scenarios, and fall difficulties in large-scale scenes and long sequences. Existing NeRF-based multi-agent SLAM frameworks cannot meet the constraints of communication bandwidth. To this end, we propose the first distributed multi-agent collaborative neural SLAM framework with hybrid scene representation, distributed camera tracking, intra-to-inter loop closure, and online distillation for multiple submap fusion. A novel triplane-grid joint scene representation method is proposed to improve scene reconstruction. A novel intra-to-inter loop closure method is designed to achieve local (single-agent) and global (multi-agent) consistency. We also design a novel online distillation method to fuse the information of different submaps to achieve global consistency. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no real-world dataset for NeRF-based/GS-based SLAM that provides both continuous-time trajectories groundtruth and high-accuracy 3D meshes groundtruth. To this end, we propose the first real-world Dense slam (DES) dataset covering both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, ranging from small rooms to large-scale outdoor scenes, with high-accuracy ground truth for both 3D mesh and continuous-time camera trajectory. This dataset can advance the development of the research in both SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and visual foundation model. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in both mapping, tracking, and communication. The dataset and code will open-source onthis https URL.

- **[Multi-view Clustering via Bi-level Decoupling and Consistency Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13499)**  `arXiv:2508.13499`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Shihao Dong, Yuhui Zheng, Huiying Xu, Xinzhong Zhu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA methods. Our code is published onthis https URL.

- **[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Using Diffusion Trend Analysis for Display Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09578)**  `arXiv:2407.09578`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Eunwoo Kim, Un Yang, Cheol Lae Roh, Stefano Ermon_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstruction-based anomaly detection via denoising diffusion model has limitations in determining appropriate noise parameters that can degrade anomalies while preserving normal characteristics. Also, normal regions can fluctuate considerably during reconstruction, resulting in false detection. In this paper, we propose a method to detect anomalies by analysis of reconstruction trend depending on the degree of degradation, effectively solving the both problems that impede practical application in display inspection.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models. We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches, from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while maintaining efficiency in training.

- **[EAvatar: Expression-Aware Head Avatar Reconstruction with Generative Geometry Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13537)**  `arXiv:2508.13537`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR, gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism, where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

- **[LongSplat: Robust Unposed 3D Gaussian Splatting for Casual Long Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14041)**  `arXiv:2508.14041`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chin-Yang Lin, Cheng Sun, Fu-En Yang, Min-Hung Chen, Yen-Yu Lin, Yu-Lun Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LongSplat addresses critical challenges in novel view synthesis (NVS) from casually captured long videos characterized by irregular camera motion, unknown camera poses, and expansive scenes. Current methods often suffer from pose drift, inaccurate geometry initialization, and severe memory limitations. To address these issues, we introduce LongSplat, a robust unposed 3D Gaussian Splatting framework featuring: (1) Incremental Joint Optimization that concurrently optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussians to avoid local minima and ensure global consistency; (2) a robust Pose Estimation Module leveraging learned 3D priors; and (3) an efficient Octree Anchor Formation mechanism that converts dense point clouds into anchors based on spatial density. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LongSplat achieves state-of-the-art results, substantially improving rendering quality, pose accuracy, and computational efficiency compared to prior approaches.

- **[Distilled-3DGS:Distilled 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14037)**  `arXiv:2508.14037`  `cs.CV`  
  _Lintao Xiang, Xinkai Chen, Jianhuang Lai, Guangcong Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians, resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS, noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles, achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **[Online 3D Gaussian Splatting Modeling with Novel View Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14014)**  `arXiv:2508.14014`  `cs.CV`  
  _Byeonggwon Lee, Junkyu Park, Khang Truong Giang, Soohwan Song_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction. However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage. However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in 3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress, current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image, enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets, annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering results. Our project page is at:this https URL

  Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights, thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original INRs under noisy conditions.

- **[Distribution-Aware Hadamard Quantization for Hardware-Efficient Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13478)**  `arXiv:2508.13478`  `cs.CV`  
  _Wenyong Zhou, Jiachen Ren, Taiqiang Wu, Yuxin Cheng, Zhengwu Liu, Ngai Wong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency. Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision counterparts.

  _Wenyong Zhou, Taiqiang Wu, Zhengwu Liu, Yuxin Cheng, Chen Zhang, Ngai Wong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to 60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

  _Rongzhen Zhao, Yi Zhao, Juho Kannala, Joni Pajarinen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning (OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors, termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities. OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally, mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Geo4D, a method to repurpose video diffusion models for monocular 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes. By leveraging the strong dynamic priors captured by large-scale pre-trained video models, Geo4D can be trained using only synthetic data while generalizing well to real data in a zero-shot manner. Geo4D predicts several complementary geometric modalities, namely point, disparity, and ray maps. We propose a new multi-modal alignment algorithm to align and fuse these modalities, as well as a sliding window approach at inference time, thus enabling robust and accurate 4D reconstruction of long videos. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Geo4D significantly surpasses state-of-the-art video depth estimation methods.

  _Rongzhen Zhao, Vivienne Wang, Juho Kannala, Joni Pajarinen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object-Centric Learning (OCL) aggregates image or video feature maps into object-level feature vectors, termed \textit{slots}. It's self-supervision of reconstructing the input from slots struggles with complex object textures, thus Vision Foundation Model (VFM) representations are used as the aggregation input and reconstruction target. Existing methods leverage VFM representations in diverse ways yet fail to fully exploit their potential. In response, we propose a unified architecture, Vector-Quantized VFMs for OCL (VQ-VFM-OCL, or VVO). The key to our unification is simply shared quantizing VFM representations in OCL aggregation and decoding. Experiments show that across different VFMs, aggregators and decoders, our VVO consistently outperforms baselines in object discovery and recognition, as well as downstream visual prediction and reasoning. We also mathematically analyze why VFM representations facilitate OCL aggregation and why their shared quantization as reconstruction targets strengthens OCL supervision.

- **[Discrete Optimization of Min-Max Violation and its Applications Across Computational Sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13437)**  `arXiv:2508.13437`  `cs.AI`  
  _Cheikh Ahmed, Mahdi Mostajabdaveh, Samin Aref, Zirui Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1) post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3) Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available atthis https URL
