- **[Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Models-based Anomaly Detection for under-constrained Cable-Driven Parallel Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07714)**  `arXiv:2507.07714`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are increasingly used for load manipulation tasks involving predefined toolpaths with intermediate stops. At each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive, unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions. Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4% average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.

- **[Topology Optimization of Leg Structures for Construction Robots Based on Variable Density Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16335)**  `arXiv:2507.16335`  `cs.RO`  
  _Xiao Liu, Xianlong Yang, Weijun Wang, Wei Feng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In complex terrain construction environments, there are high demands for robots to achieve both high payload capacity and mobility flexibility. As the key load-bearing component, the optimization of robotic leg structures is of particular importance. Therefore, this study focuses on the optimization of leg structures for construction robots, proposing a topology optimization strategy based on the SIMP (Solid Isotropic Microstructures with Penalization) variable density method along with a structural re-design approach. The design performance is comprehensively validated through finite element analysis using ANSYS. First, static and modal analyses are conducted to evaluate the rationality of the initial design. Then, topology optimization using the SIMP-based variable density method is applied to the femur section, which accounts for the largest proportion of the leg's weight. Based on iterative calculations, the femur undergoes secondary structural reconstruction. After optimization, the mass of the femur is reduced by 19.45\%, and the overall leg mass decreases by 7.92\%, achieving the goal of lightweight design. Finally, static and modal analyses are conducted on the reconstructed leg. The results demonstrate that the optimized leg still meets structural performance requirements, validating the feasibility of lightweight design. This research provides robust theoretical and technical support for lightweight construction robot design and lays a foundation for their efficient operation in complex construction environments.

- **[Scanning Bot: Efficient Scan Planning using Panoramic Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16175)**  `arXiv:2507.16175`  `cs.RO`  
  _Euijeong Lee, Kyung Min Han, Young J. Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Panoramic RGB-D cameras are known for their ability to produce high quality 3D scene reconstructions. However, operating these cameras involves manually selecting viewpoints and physically transporting the camera, making the generation of a 3D model time consuming and tedious. Additionally, the process can be challenging for novice users due to spatial constraints, such as ensuring sufficient feature overlap between viewpoint frames. To address these challenges, we propose a fully autonomous scan planning that generates an efficient tour plan for environment scanning, ensuring collision-free navigation and adequate overlap between viewpoints within the plan. Extensive experiments conducted in both synthetic and real-world environments validate the performance of our planner against state-of-the-art view planners. In particular, our method achieved an average scan coverage of 99 percent in the real-world experiment, with our approach being up to 3 times faster than state-of-the-art planners in total scan time.

- **[Beacon: A Naturalistic Driving Dataset During Blackouts for Benchmarking Traffic Reconstruction and Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14208)**  `arXiv:2412.14208`  `cs.RO`  
  _Supriya Sarker, Iftekharul Islam, Bibek Poudel, Weizi Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Extreme weather and infrastructure vulnerabilities pose significant challenges to urban mobility, particularly at intersections where signals become inoperative. To address this growing concern, we introduce Beacon, a naturalistic driving dataset capturing traffic dynamics during blackouts at two major intersections in Memphis, TN, USA. The dataset provides detailed traffic movements, including timesteps, origin, and destination lanes for each vehicle over four hours of peak periods. We analyze traffic demand, vehicle trajectories, and density across different scenarios, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction under unsignalized, signalized, and mixed traffic conditions. We find that integrating robot vehicles (RVs) into traffic flow can substantially reduce intersection delays, with wait time improvements of up to 82.6%. However, this enhanced traffic efficiency comes with varying environmental impacts, as decreased vehicle idling may lead to higher overall CO2 emissions. To the best of our knowledge, Beacon is the first publicly available traffic dataset for naturalistic driving behaviors during blackouts at intersections.

- **[COMPASS: Cooperative Multi-Agent Persistent Monitoring using Spatio-Temporal Attention Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16306)**  `arXiv:2507.16306`  `cs.MA` `cs.RO`  
  _Xingjian Zhang, Yizhuo Wang, Guillaume Sartoretti_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Persistent monitoring of dynamic targets is essential in real-world applications such as disaster response, environmental sensing, and wildlife conservation, where mobile agents must continuously gather information under uncertainty. We propose COMPASS, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables decentralized agents to persistently monitor multiple moving targets efficiently. We model the environment as a graph, where nodes represent spatial locations and edges capture topological proximity, allowing agents to reason over structured layouts and revisit informative regions as needed. Each agent independently selects actions based on a shared spatio-temporal attention network that we design to integrate historical observations and spatial context. We model target dynamics using Gaussian Processes (GPs), which support principled belief updates and enable uncertainty-aware planning. We train COMPASS using centralized value estimation and decentralized policy execution under an adaptive reward setting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that COMPASS consistently outperforms strong baselines in uncertainty reduction, target coverage, and coordination efficiency across dynamic multi-target scenarios.

- **[Semantic-Aware Gaussian Process Calibration with Structured Layerwise Kernels for Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15987)**  `arXiv:2507.15987`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Kyung-hwan Lee, Kyung-tae Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Calibrating the confidence of neural network classifiers is essential for quantifying the reliability of their predictions during inference. However, conventional Gaussian Process (GP) calibration methods often fail to capture the internal hierarchical structure of deep neural networks, limiting both interpretability and effectiveness for assessing predictive reliability. We propose a Semantic-Aware Layer-wise Gaussian Process (SAL-GP) framework that mirrors the layered architecture of the target neural network. Instead of applying a single global GP correction, SAL-GP employs a multi-layer GP model, where each layer's feature representation is mapped to a local calibration correction. These layerwise GPs are coupled through a structured multi-layer kernel, enabling joint marginalization across all layers. This design allows SAL-GP to capture both local semantic dependencies and global calibration coherence, while consistently propagating predictive uncertainty through the network. The resulting framework enhances interpretability aligned with the network architecture and enables principled evaluation of confidence consistency and uncertainty quantification in deep models.

- **[Foundation Models and Transformers for Anomaly Detection: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15905)**  `arXiv:2507.15905`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Mou√Øn Ben Ammar, Arturo Mendoza, Nacim Belkhir, Antoine Manzanera, Gianni Franchi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In line with the development of deep learning, this survey examines the transformative role of Transformers and foundation models in advancing visual anomaly detection (VAD). We explore how these architectures, with their global receptive fields and adaptability, address challenges such as long-range dependency modeling, contextual modeling and data scarcity. The survey categorizes VAD methods into reconstruction-based, feature-based and zero/few-shot approaches, highlighting the paradigm shift brought about by foundation models. By integrating attention mechanisms and leveraging large-scale pre-training, Transformers and foundation models enable more robust, interpretable, and scalable anomaly detection solutions. This work provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art techniques, their strengths, limitations, and emerging trends in leveraging these architectures for VAD.

- **[OPC: One-Point-Contraction Unlearning Toward Deep Feature Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07754)**  `arXiv:2507.07754`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Jaeheun Jung, Bosung Jung, Suhyun Bae, Donghun Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of ``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm: One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning methods.

- **[Streamlining Prediction in Bayesian Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18425)**  `arXiv:2411.18425`  `cs.LG`  
  _Rui Li, Marcus Klasson, Arno Solin, Martin Trapp_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rising interest in Bayesian deep learning (BDL) has led to a plethora of methods for estimating the posterior distribution. However, efficient computation of inferences, such as predictions, has been largely overlooked with Monte Carlo integration remaining the standard. In this work we examine streamlining prediction in BDL through a single forward pass without sampling. For this we use local linearisation on activation functions and local Gaussian approximations at linear layers. Thus allowing us to analytically compute an approximation to the posterior predictive distribution. We showcase our approach for both MLP and transformers, such as ViT and GPT-2, and assess its performance on regression and classification tasks.Open-source library:this https URL

- **[Rethinking Data Input for Point Cloud Upsampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04476)**  `arXiv:2407.04476`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Tongxu Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Point cloud upsampling is crucial for tasks like 3D reconstruction. While existing methods rely on patch-based inputs, and there is no research discussing the differences and principles between point cloud model full input and patch based input. Ergo, we propose a novel approach using whole model inputs i.e. Average Segment input. Our experiments on PU1K and ABC datasets reveal that patch-based inputs consistently outperform whole model inputs. To understand this, we will delve into factors in feature extraction, and network architecture that influence upsampling results.

- **[Dyna3DGR: 4D Cardiac Motion Tracking with Dynamic 3D Gaussian Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16608)**  `arXiv:2507.16608`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xueming Fu, Pei Wu, Yingtai Li, Xin Luo, Zihang Jiang, Junhao Mei, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate analysis of cardiac motion is crucial for evaluating cardiac function. While dynamic cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can capture detailed tissue motion throughout the cardiac cycle, the fine-grained 4D cardiac motion tracking remains challenging due to the homogeneous nature of myocardial tissue and the lack of distinctive features. Existing approaches can be broadly categorized into image based and representation-based, each with its limitations. Image-based methods, including both raditional and deep learning-based registration approaches, either struggle with topological consistency or rely heavily on extensive training data. Representation-based methods, while promising, often suffer from loss of image-level details. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic 3D Gaussian Representation (Dyna3DGR), a novel framework that combines explicit 3D Gaussian representation with implicit neural motion field modeling. Our method simultaneously optimizes cardiac structure and motion in a self-supervised manner, eliminating the need for extensive training data or point-to-point correspondences. Through differentiable volumetric rendering, Dyna3DGR efficiently bridges continuous motion representation with image-space alignment while preserving both topological and temporal consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on the ACDC dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art deep learning-based diffeomorphic registration methods in tracking accuracy. The code will be available inthis https URL.

- **[Survival Modeling from Whole Slide Images via Patch-Level Graph Clustering and Mixture Density Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16476)**  `arXiv:2507.16476`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ardhendu Sekhar, Vasu Soni, Keshav Aske, Garima Jain, Pranav Jeevan, Amit Sethi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a modular framework for predicting cancer-specific survival from whole slide pathology images (WSIs) that significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art accuracy. Our method integrating four key components. Firstly, to tackle large size of WSIs, we use dynamic patch selection via quantile-based thresholding for isolating prognostically informative tissue regions. Secondly, we use graph-guided k-means clustering to capture phenotype-level heterogeneity through spatial and morphological coherence. Thirdly, we use attention mechanisms that model both intra- and inter-cluster relationships to contextualize local features within global spatial relations between various types of tissue compartments. Finally, we use an expert-guided mixture density modeling for estimating complex survival distributions using Gaussian mixture models. The proposed model achieves a concordance index of $0.712 \pm 0.028$ and Brier score of $0.254 \pm 0.018$ on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and a concordance index of $0.645 \pm 0.017$ and Brier score of $0.281 \pm 0.031$ on TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). These results are significantly better than the state-of-art and demonstrate predictive potential of the proposed method across diverse cancer types.

- **[VGGT-Long: Chunk it, Loop it, Align it -- Pushing VGGT's Limits on Kilometer-scale Long RGB Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16443)**  `arXiv:2507.16443`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kai Deng, Zexin Ti, Jiawei Xu, Jian Yang, Jin Xie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D perception. However, extending these models to large-scale RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. In this work, we propose VGGT-Long, a simple yet effective system that pushes the limits of monocular 3D reconstruction to kilometer-scale, unbounded outdoor environments. Our approach addresses the scalability bottlenecks of existing models through a chunk-based processing strategy combined with overlapping alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without requiring camera calibration, depth supervision or model retraining, VGGT-Long achieves trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods. We evaluate our method on KITTI, Waymo, and Virtual KITTI datasets. VGGT-Long not only runs successfully on long RGB sequences where foundation models typically fail, but also produces accurate and consistent geometry across various conditions. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging foundation models for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, especially for autonomous driving scenarios.

- **[Sparse-View 3D Reconstruction: Recent Advances and Open Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16406)**  `arXiv:2507.16406`  `cs.CV`  
  _Tanveer Younis, Zhanglin Cheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is essential for applications in which dense image acquisition is impractical, such as robotics, augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), and autonomous systems. In these settings, minimal image overlap prevents reliable correspondence matching, causing traditional methods, such as structure-from-motion (SfM) and multiview stereo (MVS), to fail. This survey reviews the latest advances in neural implicit models (e.g., NeRF and its regularized versions), explicit point-cloud-based approaches (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting), and hybrid frameworks that leverage priors from diffusion and vision foundation models (VFMs).We analyze how geometric regularization, explicit shape modeling, and generative inference are used to mitigate artifacts such as floaters and pose ambiguities in sparse-view settings. Comparative results on standard benchmarks reveal key trade-offs between the reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Unlike previous reviews, our survey provides a unified perspective on geometry-based, neural implicit, and generative (diffusion-based) methods. We highlight the persistent challenges in domain generalization and pose-free reconstruction and outline future directions for developing 3D-native generative priors and achieving real-time, unconstrained sparse-view reconstruction.

- **[Dens3R: A Foundation Model for 3D Geometry Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16290)**  `arXiv:2507.16290`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xianze Fang, Jingnan Gao, Zhe Wang, Zhuo Chen, Xingyu Ren, Jiangjing Lyu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction have led to significant progress, yet achieving accurate unified geometric prediction remains a major challenge. Most existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from input images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and point maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often fails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical applicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly models the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable joint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model designed for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively build a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically invariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder backbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to maintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs. By integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling, Dens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface normals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to multi-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that supports geometrically consistent multi-view inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Dens3R across various dense 3D prediction tasks and highlight its potential for broader applications.

- **[Explicit Context Reasoning with Supervision for Visual Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16191)**  `arXiv:2507.16191`  `cs.CV`  
  _Fansheng Zeng, Bineng Zhong, Haiying Xia, Yufei Tan, Xiantao Hu, Liangtao Shi, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contextual reasoning with constraints is crucial for enhancing temporal consistency in cross-frame modeling for visual tracking. However, mainstream tracking algorithms typically associate context by merely stacking historical information without explicitly supervising the association process, making it difficult to effectively model the target's evolving dynamics. To alleviate this problem, we propose RSTrack, which explicitly models and supervises context reasoning via three core mechanisms. \textit{1) Context Reasoning Mechanism}: Constructs a target state reasoning pipeline, converting unconstrained contextual associations into a temporal reasoning process that predicts the current representation based on historical target states, thereby enhancing temporal consistency. \textit{2) Forward Supervision Strategy}: Utilizes true target features as anchors to constrain the reasoning pipeline, guiding the predicted output toward the true target distribution and suppressing drift in the context reasoning process. \textit{3) Efficient State Modeling}: Employs a compression-reconstruction mechanism to extract the core features of the target, removing redundant information across frames and preventing ineffective contextual associations. These three mechanisms collaborate to effectively alleviate the issue of contextual association divergence in traditional temporal modeling. Experimental results show that RSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets while maintaining real-time running speeds. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[CL-Polyp: A Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Network for Accurate Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07154)**  `arXiv:2507.07154`  `cs.CV`  
  _Desheng Li, Chaoliang Liu, Zhiyong Xiao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary tasks like classification to improve segmentation. However, these methods often need more labeled data and depend on task similarity, potentially limiting generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp segmentation network. Our method uses contrastive learning to enhance the encoder's extraction of discriminative features by contrasting positive and negative sample pairs from polyp images. This self-supervised strategy improves visual representation without needing additional annotations. We also introduce two efficient, lightweight modules: the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for improved multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA) module to merge low-level and upsampled features for {enhanced} boundary reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-show that CL-Polyp consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it enhances the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation.

- **[RDD: Robust Feature Detector and Descriptor using Deformable Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08013)**  `arXiv:2505.08013`  `cs.CV`  
  _Gonglin Chen, Tianwen Fu, Haiwei Chen, Wenbin Teng, Hanyuan Xiao, Yajie Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As a core step in structure-from-motion and SLAM, robust feature detection and description under challenging scenarios such as significant viewpoint changes remain unresolved despite their ubiquity. While recent works have identified the importance of local features in modeling geometric transformations, these methods fail to learn the visual cues present in long-range relationships. We present Robust Deformable Detector (RDD), a novel and robust keypoint detector/descriptor leveraging the deformable transformer, which captures global context and geometric invariance through deformable self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we observed that deformable attention focuses on key locations, effectively reducing the search space complexity and modeling the geometric invariance. Furthermore, we collected an Air-to-Ground dataset for training in addition to the standard MegaDepth dataset. Our proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art keypoint detection/description methods in sparse matching tasks and is also capable of semi-dense matching. To ensure comprehensive evaluation, we introduce two challenging benchmarks: one emphasizing large viewpoint and scale variations, and the other being an Air-to-Ground benchmark -- an evaluation setting that has recently gaining popularity for 3D reconstruction across different altitudes.

- **[Predicting the Reliability of an Image Classifier under Image Distortion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16881)**  `arXiv:2412.16881`  `cs.CV`  
  _Dang Nguyen, Sunil Gupta, Kien Do, Svetha Venkatesh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In image classification tasks, deep learning models are vulnerable to image distortions i.e. their accuracy significantly drops if the input images are distorted. An image-classifier is considered "reliable" if its accuracy on distorted images is above a user-specified threshold. For a quality control purpose, it is important to predict if the image-classifier is unreliable/reliable under a distortion level. In other words, we want to predict whether a distortion level makes the image-classifier "non-reliable" or "reliable". Our solution is to construct a training set consisting of distortion levels along with their "non-reliable" or "reliable" labels, and train a machine learning predictive model (called distortion-classifier) to classify unseen distortion levels. However, learning an effective distortion-classifier is a challenging problem as the training set is highly imbalanced. To address this problem, we propose a Gaussian process based method to rebalance the training set. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our method significantly outperforms several baselines on six popular image datasets.
