- **[Staircase Recognition and Location Based on Polarization Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19026)**  `arXiv:2505.19026`  `cs.RO`  
  _Weifeng Kong, Zhiying Tan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Staircase is one of the most common structures in artificial scenes. However, it is difficult for humanoid robots and people with lower limb disabilities or visual impairment to cross the scene without the help of sensors and intelligent algorithms. Staircase scene perception technology is a prerequisite for recognition and localization. This technology is of great significance for the mode switching of the robot and the calculation of the footprint position to adapt to the discontinuous terrain. However, there are still many problems that constrain the application of this technology, such as low recognition accuracy, high initial noise from sensors, unstable output signals and high computational requirements. In terms of scene reconstruction, the binocular and time of flight (TOF) reconstruction of the scene can be easily affected by environmental light and the surface material of the target object. In contrast, due to the special structure of the polarizer, the polarization can selectively transmit polarized light in a specific direction and this reconstruction method relies on the polarization information of the object surface. So the advantages of polarization reconstruction are reflected, which are less affected by environmental light and not dependent on the texture information of the object surface. In this paper, in order to achieve the detection of staircase, this paper proposes a contrast enhancement algorithm that integrates polarization and light intensity information, and integrates point cloud segmentation based on YOLOv11. To realize the high-quality reconstruction, we proposed a method of fusing polarized binocular and TOF depth information to realize the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the staircase. Besides, it also proposes a joint calibration algorithm of monocular camera and TOF camera based on ICP registration and improved gray wolf optimization algorithm.

- **[Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Prediction via Rule-Regularized Heteroscedastic Deep Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13111)**  `arXiv:2504.13111`  `cs.LG` `cs.RO`

  Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher. Project page:this https URL.

- **[Escaping Plato's Cave: JAM for Aligning Independently Trained Vision and Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01201)**  `arXiv:2507.01201`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Lauren Hyoseo Yoon, Yisong Yue, Been Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and architectures. The Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) suggests these models may nonetheless converge toward a shared statistical model of reality. This raises a fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc detection of such alignment and explicitly optimize for it? We argue this challenge is most critical in fine-grained contextual distinctions-where multiple descriptions share global semantics but differ in subtle compositional details. We address this with the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM), which aligns frozen unimodal models by jointly training modality-specific autoencoders with coordinated reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. We systematically evaluate JAM across three design axes: (i) alignment objectives, introducing our multimodal Spread Loss that outperforms classic contrastive methods; (ii) the layer depth at which alignment is most effective; and (iii) the role of foundation model scale in representational convergence. Our findings show that JAM reliably induces alignment even across independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight into the structure of shared semantics and practical guidance for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into specialist multimodal models.

- **[Unleashing Uncertainty: Efficient Machine Unlearning for Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20773)**  `arXiv:2508.20773`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Christoforos N. Spartalis, Theodoros Semertzidis, Petros Daras, Efstratios Gavves_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce SAFEMax, a novel method for Machine Unlearning in diffusion models. Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific information is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax and highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.

- **[EEGDM: Learning EEG Representation with Latent Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20705)**  `arXiv:2508.20705`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Shaocong Wang, Tong Liu, Ming Li, Minjing Yu, Yong-Jin Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks, particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its generalizability and practical utility.

- **[TF-TransUNet1D: Time-Frequency Guided Transformer U-Net for Robust ECG Denoising in Digital Twin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20398)**  `arXiv:2508.20398`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Shijie Wang, Lei Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database (NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins, enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

- **[GPT-FT: An Efficient Automated Feature Transformation Using GPT for Sequence Reconstruction and Performance Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20824)**  `arXiv:2508.20824`  `cs.LG`  
  _Yang Gao, Dongjie Wang, Scott Piersall, Ye Zhang, Liqiang Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem, converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps: transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and (b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

- **[Structure-aware Hypergraph Transformer for Diagnosis Prediction in Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20500)**  `arXiv:2508.20500`  `cs.LG`  
  _Haiyan Wang, Ye Yuan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR. However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

- **[Surfel-based 3D Registration with Equivariant SE(3) Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20789)**  `arXiv:2508.20789`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Xueyang Kang, Hang Zhao, Kourosh Khoshelham, Patrick Vandewalle_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations. To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss. Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **[${C}^{3}$-GS: Learning Context-aware, Cross-dimension, Cross-scale Feature for Generalizable Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20754)**  `arXiv:2508.20754`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yuxi Hu, Jun Zhang, Kuangyi Chen, Zhe Zhang, Friedrich Fraundorfer_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters, enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware, cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is available at:this https URL.

- **[POSE: Phased One-Step Adversarial Equilibrium for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21019)**  `arXiv:2508.21019`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jiaxiang Cheng, Bing Ma, Xuhua Ren, Hongyi Jin, Kai Yu, Peng Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences. Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models. To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii) conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment, temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining competitive performance.

- **[DrivingGaussian++: Towards Realistic Reconstruction and Editable Simulation for Surrounding Dynamic Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20965)**  `arXiv:2508.20965`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yajiao Xiong, Xiaoyu Zhou, Yongtao Wan, Deqing Sun, Ming-Hsuan Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present DrivingGaussian++, an efficient and effective framework for realistic reconstructing and controllable editing of surrounding dynamic autonomous driving scenes. DrivingGaussian++ models the static background using incremental 3D Gaussians and reconstructs moving objects with a composite dynamic Gaussian graph, ensuring accurate positions and occlusions. By integrating a LiDAR prior, it achieves detailed and consistent scene reconstruction, outperforming existing methods in dynamic scene reconstruction and photorealistic surround-view synthesis. DrivingGaussian++ supports training-free controllable editing for dynamic driving scenes, including texture modification, weather simulation, and object manipulation, leveraging multi-view images and depth priors. By integrating large language models (LLMs) and controllable editing, our method can automatically generate dynamic object motion trajectories and enhance their realism during the optimization process. DrivingGaussian++ demonstrates consistent and realistic editing results and generates dynamic multi-view driving scenarios, while significantly enhancing scene diversity.

- **[AvatarBack: Back-Head Generation for Complete 3D Avatars from Front-View Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20623)**  `arXiv:2508.20623`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shiqi Xin, Xiaolin Zhang, Yanbin Liu, Peng Zhang, Caifeng Shan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy (ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training, effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric, photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

- **[Optimization-Based Calibration for Intravascular Ultrasound Volume Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20605)**  `arXiv:2508.20605`  `cs.CV`  
  _Karl-Philippe Beaudet, Sidaty El Hadramy, Philippe C Cattin, Juan Verde, St√©phane Cotin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS) offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ, which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate 3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance intraoperative guidance.

- **[Adam SLAM - the last mile of camera calibration with 3DGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20526)**  `arXiv:2508.20526`  `cs.CV`  
  _Matthieu Gendrin, St√©phane Pateux, Xiaoran Jiang, Th√©o Ladune, Luce Morin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake of novel view quality is the most important.

  _En Ci, Shanyan Guan, Yanhao Ge, Yilin Zhang, Wei Li, Zhenyu Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion. Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it improves editing accuracy and consistency.

  Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous. Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects. Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

  _Ruizhe Wang, Junyan Yang, Qiao Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce GeoTexBuild, a modular generative framework for creating 3D building models from footprints derived from site planning or map designs. The system is designed for architects and city planners, offering a seamless solution that directly converts map features into 3D buildings. The proposed framework employs a three-stage process comprising height map generation, geometry reconstruction, and appearance stylization, culminating in building models with detailed geometry and appearance attributes. By integrating customized ControlNet, Neural style field (NSF), and Multi-view diffusion model, we explore effective methods for controlling both geometric and visual attributes during the generation process. Our approach eliminates the problem of structural variations in a single facade image in existing 3D generation techniques for buildings. Experimental results at each stage validate the capability of GeoTexBuild to generate detailed and accurate building models from footprints.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent segmentation foundation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), exhibits strong zero-shot segmentation capabilities, but it falls short in generating fine-grained precise masks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel zero-shot image matting model, called ZIM, with two key contributions: First, we develop a label converter that transforms segmentation labels into detailed matte labels, constructing the new SA1B-Matte dataset without costly manual annotations. Training SAM with this dataset enables it to generate precise matte masks while maintaining its zero-shot capability. Second, we design the zero-shot matting model equipped with a hierarchical pixel decoder to enhance mask representation, along with a prompt-aware masked attention mechanism to improve performance by enabling the model to focus on regions specified by visual prompts. We evaluate ZIM using the newly introduced MicroMat-3K test set, which contains high-quality micro-level matte labels. Experimental results show that ZIM outperforms existing methods in fine-grained mask generation and zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of ZIM in various downstream tasks requiring precise masks, such as image inpainting and 3D NeRF. Our contributions provide a robust foundation for advancing zero-shot matting and its downstream applications across a wide range of computer vision tasks. The code is available atthis https URL.
