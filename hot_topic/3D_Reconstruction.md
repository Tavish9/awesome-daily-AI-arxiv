- **[ActiveGS: Active Scene Reconstruction Using Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17769)**  `arXiv:2412.17769`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  Robotics applications often rely on scene reconstructions to enable downstream tasks. In this work, we tackle the challenge of actively building an accurate map of an unknown scene using an RGB-D camera on a mobile platform. We propose a hybrid map representation that combines a Gaussian splatting map with a coarse voxel map, leveraging the strengths of both representations: the high-fidelity scene reconstruction capabilities of Gaussian splatting and the spatial modelling strengths of the voxel map. At the core of our framework is an effective confidence modelling technique for the Gaussian splatting map to identify under-reconstructed areas, while utilising spatial information from the voxel map to target unexplored areas and assist in collision-free path planning. By actively collecting scene information in under-reconstructed and unexplored areas for map updates, our approach achieves superior Gaussian splatting reconstruction results compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, we demonstrate the real-world applicability of our framework using an unmanned aerial vehicle.

  With the increasing demand for human-computer interaction (HCI), flexible wearable gloves have emerged as a promising solution in virtual reality, medical rehabilitation, and industrial automation. However, the current technology still has problems like insufficient sensitivity and limited durability, which hinder its wide application. This paper presents a highly sensitive, modular, and flexible capacitive sensor based on line-shaped electrodes and liquid metal (EGaIn), integrated into a sensor module tailored to the human hand's anatomy. The proposed system independently captures bending information from each finger joint, while additional measurements between adjacent fingers enable the recording of subtle variations in inter-finger spacing. This design enables accurate gesture recognition and dynamic hand morphological reconstruction of complex movements using point clouds. Experimental results demonstrate that our classifier based on Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) achieves an accuracy of 99.15% across 30 gestures. Meanwhile, a transformer-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) accurately reconstructs dynamic hand shapes with an Average Distance (AD) of 2.076\pm3.231 mm, with the reconstruction accuracy at individual key points surpassing SOTA benchmarks by 9.7% to 64.9%. The proposed glove shows excellent accuracy, robustness and scalability in gesture recognition and hand reconstruction, making it a promising solution for next-generation HCI systems.

- **[SR-LIO++: Efficient LiDAR-Inertial Odometry and Quantized Mapping with Sweep Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22926)**  `arXiv:2503.22926`  `cs.RO`

  Addressing the inherent low acquisition frequency limitation of 3D LiDAR to achieve high-frequency output has become a critical research focus in the LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) domain. To ensure real-time performance, frequency-enhanced LIO systems must process each sweep within significantly reduced timeframe, which presents substantial challenges for deployment on low-computational-power platforms. To address these limitations, we introduce SR-LIO++, an innovative LIO system capable of achieving doubled output frequency relative to input frequency on resource-constrained hardware platforms, including the Raspberry Pi 4B. Our system employs a sweep reconstruction methodology to enhance LiDAR sweep frequency, generating high-frequency reconstructed sweeps. Building upon this foundation, we propose a caching mechanism for intermediate results (i.e., surface parameters) of the most recent segments, effectively minimizing redundant processing of common segments in adjacent reconstructed sweeps. This method decouples processing time from the traditionally linear dependence on reconstructed sweep frequency. Furthermore, we present a quantized map point management based on index table mapping, significantly reducing memory usage by converting global 3D point storage from 64-bit double precision to 8-bit char representation. This method also converts the computationally intensive Euclidean distance calculations in nearest neighbor searches from 64-bit double precision to 16-bit short and 32-bit integer formats, significantly reducing both memory and computational cost. Extensive experimental evaluations across three distinct computing platforms and four public datasets demonstrate that SR-LIO++ maintains state-of-the-art accuracy while substantially enhancing efficiency. Notably, our system successfully achieves 20Hz state output on Raspberry Pi 4B hardware.

- **[GOLLuM: Gaussian Process Optimized LLMs -- Reframing LLM Finetuning through Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06265)**  `arXiv:2504.06265`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Bojana Rankoviƒá, Philippe Schwaller_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) can encode complex relationships in their latent spaces, yet harnessing them for optimization under uncertainty remains challenging. We address this gap with a novel architecture that reframes LLM finetuning as Gaussian process (GP) marginal likelihood optimization via deep kernel methods. We introduce LLM-based deep kernels, jointly optimized with GPs to preserve the benefits of both - LLMs to provide a rich and flexible input space for Bayesian optimization and - GPs to model this space with predictive uncertainty for more efficient sampling. Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reaction optimization, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-performing reactions compared to static LLM embeddings (from 24% to 43% coverage of the top 5% reactions in just 50 optimization iterations). We also observe a 14% improvement over domain-specific representations without requiring specialized features. Extensive empirical evaluation across 19 benchmarks - ranging from general chemistry to reaction and molecular property optimization - demonstrates our method's robustness, generality, and consistent improvements across: (1) tasks, (2) LLM architectures (encoder, decoder, encoder-decoder), (3) pretraining domains (chemistry-related or general-purpose) and (4) hyperparameter settings (tuned once on a single dataset). Finally, we explain these improvements: joint LLM-GP optimization through marginal likelihood implicitly performs contrastive learning, aligning representations to produce (1) better-structured embedding spaces, (2) improved uncertainty calibration, and (3) more efficient sampling - without requiring any external loss. This work provides both practical advances in sample-efficient optimization and insights into what makes effective Bayesian optimization.

- **[Hall Effect Thruster Forecasting using a Topological Approach for Data Assimilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06157)**  `arXiv:2504.06157`  `cs.LG`  
  _Max M. Chumley, Firas A. Khasawneh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hall Effect Thrusters (HETs) are electric thrusters that eject heavy ionized gas particles from the spacecraft to generate thrust. Although traditionally they were used for station keeping, recently They have been used for interplanetary space missions due to their high delta-V potential and their operational longevity in contrast to other thrusters, e.g., chemical. However, the operation of HETs involves complex processes such as ionization of gases, strong magnetic fields, and complicated solar panel power supply interactions. Therefore, their operation is extremely difficult to model thus necessitating Data Assimilation (DA) approaches for estimating and predicting their operational states. Because HET's operating environment is often noisy with non-Gaussian sources, this significantly limits applicable DA tools. We describe a topological approach for data assimilation that bypasses these limitations that does not depend on the noise model, and utilize it to forecast spatiotemporal plume field states of HETs. Our approach is a generalization of the Topological Approach for Data Assimilation (TADA) method that allows including different forecast functions. We show how TADA can be combined with the Long Short-Term Memory network for accurate forecasting. We then apply our approach to high-fidelity Hall Effect Thruster (HET) simulation data from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) rocket propulsion division where we demonstrate the forecast resiliency of TADA on noise contaminated, high-dimensional data.

  Adverse weather conditions, particularly convective phenomena, pose significant challenges to Air Traffic Management, often requiring real-time rerouting decisions that impact efficiency and safety. This study introduces a 3-D Gaussian Mixture Model to predict long lead-time flight trajectory changes, incorporating comprehensive weather and traffic data. Utilizing high-resolution meteorological datasets, including convective weather maps and wind data, alongside traffic records, the model demonstrates robust performance in forecasting reroutes up to 60 minutes. The novel 3-D Gaussian Mixture Model framework employs a probabilistic approach to capture uncertainty while providing accurate forecasts of altitude, latitude, and longitude. Extensive evaluation revealed a Mean Absolute Percentage Error below 0.02 across varying lead times, highlighting the model's accuracy and scalability. By integrating explainability techniques such as the Vanilla Gradient algorithm, the study provides insights into feature contributions, showing that they contribute to improving Air Traffic Management strategies to mitigate weather-induced disruptions.

- **[Estimating the Probability of Sampling a Trained Neural Network at Random](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18812)**  `arXiv:2501.18812`  `cs.LG`  
  _Adam Scherlis, Nora Belrose_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present and analyze an algorithm for estimating the size, under a Gaussian or uniform measure, of a localized neighborhood in neural network parameter space with behavior similar to an ``anchor'' point. We refer to this as the "local volume" of the anchor. We adapt an existing basin-volume estimator, which is very fast but in many cases only provides a lower bound. We show that this lower bound can be improved with an importance-sampling method using gradient information that is already provided by popular optimizers. The negative logarithm of local volume can also be interpreted as a measure of the anchor network's information content. As expected for a measure of complexity, this quantity increases during language model training. We find that overfit, badly-generalizing neighborhoods are smaller, indicating a more complex learned behavior. This smaller volume can also be interpreted in an MDL sense as suboptimal compression. Our results are consistent with a picture of generalization we call the "volume hypothesis": that neural net training produces good generalization primarily because the architecture gives simple functions more volume in parameter space, and the optimizer samples from the low-loss manifold in a volume-sensitive way. We believe that fast local-volume estimators are a promising practical metric of network complexity and architectural inductive bias for interpretability purposes.

- **[Scalable Dynamic Mixture Model with Full Covariance for Probabilistic Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06653)**  `arXiv:2212.06653`  `cs.LG`  
  _Seongjin Choi, Nicolas Saunier, Vincent Zhihao Zheng, Martin Trepanier, Lijun Sun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning-based multivariate and multistep-ahead traffic forecasting models are typically trained with the mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE) as the loss function in a sequence-to-sequence setting, simply assuming that the errors follow an independent and isotropic Gaussian or Laplacian distributions. However, such assumptions are often unrealistic for real-world traffic forecasting tasks, where the probabilistic distribution of spatiotemporal forecasting is very complex with strong concurrent correlations across both sensors and forecasting horizons in a time-varying manner. In this paper, we model the time-varying distribution for the matrix-variate error process as a dynamic mixture of zero-mean Gaussian distributions. To achieve efficiency, flexibility, and scalability, we parameterize each mixture component using a matrix normal distribution and allow the mixture weight to change and be predictable over time. The proposed method can be seamlessly integrated into existing deep-learning frameworks with only a few additional parameters to be learned. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on a traffic speed forecasting task and find that our method not only improves model performance but also provides interpretable spatiotemporal correlation structures.

- **[ProtoGS: Efficient and High-Quality Rendering with 3D Gaussian Prototypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17486)**  `arXiv:2503.17486`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made significant strides in novel view synthesis but is limited by the substantial number of Gaussian primitives required, posing challenges for deployment on lightweight devices. Recent methods address this issue by compressing the storage size of densified Gaussians, yet fail to preserve rendering quality and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose ProtoGS to learn Gaussian prototypes to represent Gaussian primitives, significantly reducing the total Gaussian amount without sacrificing visual quality. Our method directly uses Gaussian prototypes to enable efficient rendering and leverage the resulting reconstruction loss to guide prototype learning. To further optimize memory efficiency during training, we incorporate structure-from-motion (SfM) points as anchor points to group Gaussian primitives. Gaussian prototypes are derived within each group by clustering of K-means, and both the anchor points and the prototypes are optimized jointly. Our experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets prove that we outperform existing methods, achieving a substantial reduction in the number of Gaussians, and enabling high rendering speed while maintaining or even enhancing rendering fidelity.

  Neural implicit reconstruction via volume rendering has demonstrated its effectiveness in recovering dense 3D surfaces. However, it is non-trivial to simultaneously recover meticulous geometry and preserve smoothness across regions with differing characteristics. To address this issue, previous methods typically employ geometric priors, which are often constrained by the performance of the prior models. In this paper, we propose ND-SDF, which learns a Normal Deflection field to represent the angular deviation between the scene normal and the prior normal. Unlike previous methods that uniformly apply geometric priors on all samples, introducing significant bias in accuracy, our proposed normal deflection field dynamically learns and adapts the utilization of samples based on their specific characteristics, thereby improving both the accuracy and effectiveness of the model. Our method not only obtains smooth weakly textured regions such as walls and floors but also preserves the geometric details of complex structures. In addition, we introduce a novel ray sampling strategy based on the deflection angle to facilitate the unbiased rendering process, which significantly improves the quality and accuracy of intricate surfaces, especially on thin structures. Consistent improvements on various challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.

- **[D^2USt3R: Enhancing 3D Reconstruction with 4D Pointmaps for Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06264)**  `arXiv:2504.06264`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jisang Han, Honggyu An, Jaewoo Jung, Takuya Narihira, Junyoung Seo, Kazumi Fukuda, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We address the task of 3D reconstruction in dynamic scenes, where object motions degrade the quality of previous 3D pointmap regression methods, such as DUSt3R, originally designed for static 3D scene reconstruction. Although these methods provide an elegant and powerful solution in static settings, they struggle in the presence of dynamic motions that disrupt alignment based solely on camera poses. To overcome this, we propose D^2USt3R that regresses 4D pointmaps that simultaneiously capture both static and dynamic 3D scene geometry in a feed-forward manner. By explicitly incorporating both spatial and temporal aspects, our approach successfully encapsulates spatio-temporal dense correspondence to the proposed 4D pointmaps, enhancing downstream tasks. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently achieves superior reconstruction performance across various datasets featuring complex motions.

- **[HiMoR: Monocular Deformable Gaussian Reconstruction with Hierarchical Motion Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06210)**  `arXiv:2504.06210`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yiming Liang, Tianhan Xu, Yuta Kikuchi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Hierarchical Motion Representation (HiMoR), a novel deformation representation for 3D Gaussian primitives capable of achieving high-quality monocular dynamic 3D reconstruction. The insight behind HiMoR is that motions in everyday scenes can be decomposed into coarser motions that serve as the foundation for finer details. Using a tree structure, HiMoR's nodes represent different levels of motion detail, with shallower nodes modeling coarse motion for temporal smoothness and deeper nodes capturing finer motion. Additionally, our model uses a few shared motion bases to represent motions of different sets of nodes, aligning with the assumption that motion tends to be smooth and simple. This motion representation design provides Gaussians with a more structured deformation, maximizing the use of temporal relationships to tackle the challenging task of monocular dynamic 3D reconstruction. We also propose using a more reliable perceptual metric as an alternative, given that pixel-level metrics for evaluating monocular dynamic 3D reconstruction can sometimes fail to accurately reflect the true quality of reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's efficacy in achieving superior novel view synthesis from challenging monocular videos with complex motions.

- **[Under-Sampled High-Dimensional Data Recovery via Symbiotic Multi-Prior Tensor Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05992)**  `arXiv:2504.05992`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jie Yang, Chang Su, Yuhan Zhang, Jianjun Zhu, Jianli Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advancement of sensing technology has driven the widespread application of high-dimensional data. However, issues such as missing entries during acquisition and transmission negatively impact the accuracy of subsequent tasks. Tensor reconstruction aims to recover the underlying complete data from under-sampled observed data by exploring prior information in high-dimensional data. However, due to insufficient exploration, reconstruction methods still face challenges when sampling rate is extremely low. This work proposes a tensor reconstruction method integrating multiple priors to comprehensively exploit the inherent structure of the data. Specifically, the method combines learnable tensor decomposition to enforce low-rank constraints of the reconstructed data, a pre-trained convolutional neural network for smoothing and denoising, and block-matching and 3D filtering regularization to enhance the non-local similarity in the reconstructed data. An alternating direction method of the multipliers algorithm is designed to decompose the resulting optimization problem into three subproblems for efficient resolution. Extensive experiments on color images, hyperspectral images, and grayscale videos datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in extreme cases as compared with state-of-the-art methods.

- **[Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection with Diffusion Models via Direct Latent Likelihood Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05662)**  `arXiv:2504.05662`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shunsuke Sakai, Tatsuhito Hasegawa_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models, with their robust distribution approximation capabilities, have demonstrated excellent performance in anomaly detection. However, conventional reconstruction-based approaches rely on computing the reconstruction error between the original and denoised images, which requires careful noise-strength tuning and over ten network evaluations per input-leading to significantly slower detection speeds. To address these limitations, we propose a novel diffusion-based anomaly detection method that circumvents the need for resource-intensive reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing the input image, we directly infer its corresponding latent variables and measure their density under the Gaussian prior distribution. Remarkably, the prior density proves effective as an anomaly score even when using a short partial diffusion process of only 2-5 steps. We evaluate our method on the MVTecAD dataset, achieving an AUC of 0.991 at 15 FPS, thereby setting a new state-of-the-art speed-AUC anomaly detection trade-off.

- **[Neural Pruning for 3D Scene Reconstruction: Efficient NeRF Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00950)**  `arXiv:2504.00950`  `cs.CV`  
  _Tianqi Ding, Dawei Xiang, Pablo Rivas, Liang Dong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have become a popular 3D reconstruction approach in recent years. While they produce high-quality results, they also demand lengthy training times, often spanning days. This paper studies neural pruning as a strategy to address these concerns. We compare pruning approaches, including uniform sampling, importance-based methods, and coreset-based techniques, to reduce the model size and speed up training. Our findings show that coreset-driven pruning can achieve a 50% reduction in model size and a 35% speedup in training, with only a slight decrease in accuracy. These results suggest that pruning can be an effective method for improving the efficiency of NeRF models in resource-limited settings.

- **[PBR-NeRF: Inverse Rendering with Physics-Based Neural Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09680)**  `arXiv:2412.09680`  `cs.CV`  
  _Sean Wu, Shamik Basu, Tim Broedermann, Luc Van Gool, Christos Sakaridis_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We tackle the ill-posed inverse rendering problem in 3D reconstruction with a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) approach informed by Physics-Based Rendering (PBR) theory, named PBR-NeRF. Our method addresses a key limitation in most NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches: they estimate view-dependent appearance without modeling scene materials and illumination. To address this limitation, we present an inverse rendering (IR) model capable of jointly estimating scene geometry, materials, and illumination. Our model builds upon recent NeRF-based IR approaches, but crucially introduces two novel physics-based priors that better constrain the IR estimation. Our priors are rigorously formulated as intuitive loss terms and achieve state-of-the-art material estimation without compromising novel view synthesis quality. Our method is easily adaptable to other inverse rendering and 3D reconstruction frameworks that require material estimation. We demonstrate the importance of extending current neural rendering approaches to fully model scene properties beyond geometry and view-dependent appearance.
