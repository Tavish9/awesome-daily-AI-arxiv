- **[Learning human-to-robot handovers through 3D scene reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08726)**  `arXiv:2507.08726`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation. Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes. We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects and {\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective representation for the human-to-robot handover task.

- **[An Enhanced Privacy-preserving Federated Few-shot Learning Framework for Respiratory Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08050)**  `arXiv:2507.08050`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover, patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

- **[Distributional Soft Actor-Critic with Diffusion Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01381)**  `arXiv:2507.01381`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D (Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all 9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total average return improvement of over 10% compared to existing mainstream algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.

- **[Downscaling Extreme Precipitation with Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00381)**  `arXiv:2410.00381`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yuhao Liu, James Doss-Gollin, Qiushi Dai, Ashok Veeraraghavan, Guha Balakrishnan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the risks posed by extreme rainfall events necessitates both high-resolution products (to assess localized hazards) and extensive historical records (to capture rare occurrences). Radar and mesonet networks provide kilometer-scale precipitation fields, but with limited historical records and geographical coverage. Conversely, global gauge and blended products span decades, yet their coarse 30-50 km grids obscure local extremes. This work introduces Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion (WassDiff), a generative downscaling framework that integrates diffusion modeling with a distribution-matching (Wasserstein) regularizer, suppressing bias throughout the entire generative denoising process. Conditioned on 55 km CPC gauge-based precipitation and the 31 km ERA5 reanalysis, WassDiff generates 1 km precipitation estimates that remain well-calibrated to targets across the full intensity range, including the extremes. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that WassDiff outperforms existing state-of-the-art downscaling methods, delivering lower reconstruction error and reduced bias. Case studies further demonstrate its ability to reproduce realistic fine-scale structures and accurate peak intensities from extreme weather phenomena, such as tropical storms and cold fronts. By unlocking decades of high-resolution rainfall information from globally available coarse records, WassDiff offers a practical pathway toward more accurate flood-risk assessments and climate-adaptation planning.

- **[Modeling Partially Observed Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Efficient Data Assimilation via Discrete-Time Conditional Gaussian Koopman Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08749)**  `arXiv:2507.08749`  `cs.LG`  
  _Chuanqi Chen, Zhongrui Wang, Nan Chen, Jin-Long Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A discrete-time conditional Gaussian Koopman network (CGKN) is developed in this work to learn surrogate models that can perform efficient state forecast and data assimilation (DA) for high-dimensional complex dynamical systems, e.g., systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Focusing on nonlinear partially observed systems that are common in many engineering and earth science applications, this work exploits Koopman embedding to discover a proper latent representation of the unobserved system states, such that the dynamics of the latent states are conditional linear, i.e., linear with the given observed system states. The modeled system of the observed and latent states then becomes a conditional Gaussian system, for which the posterior distribution of the latent states is Gaussian and can be efficiently evaluated via analytical formulae. The analytical formulae of DA facilitate the incorporation of DA performance into the learning process of the modeled system, which leads to a framework that unifies scientific machine learning (SciML) and data assimilation. The performance of discrete-time CGKN is demonstrated on several canonical problems governed by nonlinear PDEs with intermittency and turbulent features, including the viscous Burgers' equation, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations, with which we show that the discrete-time CGKN framework achieves comparable performance as the state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and provides efficient and accurate DA results. The discrete-time CGKN framework also serves as an example to illustrate unifying the development of SciML models and their other outer-loop applications such as design optimization, inverse problems, and optimal control.

- **[RTNinja: a generalized machine learning framework for analyzing random telegraph noise signals in nanoelectronic devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08424)**  `arXiv:2507.08424`  `cs.LG`  
  _Anirudh Varanasi, Robin Degraeve, Philippe Roussel, Clement Merckling_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here, we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal; and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking, reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.

- **[Leveraging Machine Learning and Enhanced Parallelism Detection for BPMN Model Generation from Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08362)**  `arXiv:2507.08362`  `cs.LG`  
  _Phuong Nam L√™, Charlotte Schneider-Depr√©, Alexandre Goossens, Alexander Stevens, Aur√©lie Leribaux, Johannes De Smedt_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient planning, resource management, and consistent operations often rely on converting textual process documents into formal Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) models. However, this conversion process remains time-intensive and costly. Existing approaches, whether rule-based or machine-learning-based, still struggle with writing styles and often fail to identify parallel structures in process descriptions.This paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting BPMN models from text, leveraging the use of machine learning and large language models. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of a newly annotated dataset, which significantly enhances the training process. Specifically, we augment the PET dataset with 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways for model training, a critical feature often overlooked in existing datasets. This addition enables models to better capture parallel structures, a common but complex aspect of process descriptions. The proposed approach demonstrates adequate performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a promising foundation for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.

- **[Amortized Posterior Sampling with Diffusion Prior Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17907)**  `arXiv:2407.17907`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Abbas Mammadov, Hyungjin Chung, Jong Chul Ye_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Amortized Posterior Sampling (APS), a novel variational inference approach for efficient posterior sampling in inverse problems. Our method trains a conditional flow model to minimize the divergence between the variational distribution and the posterior distribution implicitly defined by the diffusion model. This results in a powerful, amortized sampler capable of generating diverse posterior samples with a single neural function evaluation, generalizing across various measurements. Unlike existing methods, our approach is unsupervised, requires no paired training data, and is applicable to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of tasks, including image restoration, manifold signal reconstruction, and climate data imputation. APS significantly outperforms existing approaches in computational efficiency while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality, enabling real-time, high-quality solutions to inverse problems across diverse domains.

- **[Review of Feed-forward 3D Reconstruction: From DUSt3R to VGGT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08448)**  `arXiv:2507.08448`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Wei Zhang, Yihang Wu, Songhua Li, Wenjie Ma, Xin Ma, Qiang Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications, including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models, exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

- **[Temporally Consistent Amodal Completion for 3D Human-Object Interaction Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08137)**  `arXiv:2507.08137`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

- **[Objectomaly: Objectness-Aware Refinement for OoD Segmentation with Structural Consistency and Boundary Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07460)**  `arXiv:2507.07460`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose \textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1) Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2) Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to 0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon publication.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology, which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing \textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty. SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly available.

- **[An Efficient Approach for Muscle Segmentation and 3D Reconstruction Using Keypoint Tracking in MRI Scan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08690)**  `arXiv:2507.08690`  `cs.CV`  
  _Mengyuan Liu, Jeongkyu Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability. This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

- **[BayesTTA: Continual-Temporal Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models via Gaussian Discriminant Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08607)**  `arXiv:2507.08607`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shuang Cui, Jinglin Xu, Yi Li, Xiongxin Tang, Jiangmeng Li, Jiahuan Zhou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting; entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data, adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment. We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets. Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining efficiency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work presents a unified, fully differentiable model for multi-people tracking that learns to associate detections into trajectories without relying on pre-computed tracklets. The model builds a dynamic spatiotemporal graph that aggregates spatial, contextual, and temporal information, enabling seamless information propagation across entire sequences. To improve occlusion handling, the graph can also encode scene-specific information. We also introduce a new large-scale dataset with 25 partially overlapping views, detailed scene reconstructions, and extensive occlusions. Experiments show the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks and the new dataset, with flexibility across diverse conditions. Both the dataset and approach will be publicly released to advance research in multi-people tracking.

- **[RePaintGS: Reference-Guided Gaussian Splatting for Realistic and View-Consistent 3D Scene Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08434)**  `arXiv:2507.08434`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ji Hyun Seo, Byounhyun Yoo, Gerard Jounghyun Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

  _Zesong Yang, Bangbang Yang, Wenqi Dong, Chenxuan Cao, Liyuan Cui, Yuewen Ma, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques, which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal: decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world. Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually intact objects.

  _Ravi Shankar Prasad, Dinesh Singh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning. In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40 volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

- **[RegGS: Unposed Sparse Views Gaussian Splatting with 3DGS Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08136)**  `arXiv:2507.08136`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chong Cheng, Yu Hu, Sicheng Yu, Beizhen Zhao, Zijian Wang, Hao Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a 3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space. Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the $\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view synthesis.

  Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields, often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs. Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

  Building state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong captioning capabilities typically necessitates training on billions of high-quality image-text pairs, requiring millions of GPU hours. This paper introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models (image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure under $1,000 USD.

  Novel view synthesis (NVS) boosts immersive experiences in computer vision and graphics. Existing techniques, though progressed, rely on dense multi-view observations, restricting their application. This work takes on the challenge of reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes from sparse or single-view inputs. We introduce SpatialCrafter, a framework that leverages the rich knowledge in video diffusion models to generate plausible additional observations, thereby alleviating reconstruction ambiguity. Through a trainable camera encoder and an epipolar attention mechanism for explicit geometric constraints, we achieve precise camera control and 3D consistency, further reinforced by a unified scale estimation strategy to handle scale discrepancies across datasets. Furthermore, by integrating monocular depth priors with semantic features in the video latent space, our framework directly regresses 3D Gaussian primitives and efficiently processes long-sequence features using a hybrid network structure. Extensive experiments show our method enhances sparse view reconstruction and restores the realistic appearance of 3D scenes.

  While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves photorealistic novel view synthesis, its performance degrades with motion blur. In scenarios with rapid motion or low-light conditions, existing RGB-based deblurring methods struggle to model camera pose and radiance changes during exposure, reducing reconstruction accuracy. Event cameras, capturing continuous brightness changes during exposure, can effectively assist in modeling motion blur and improving reconstruction quality. Therefore, we propose Event-driven Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting (EBAD-Gaussian), which reconstructs sharp 3D Gaussians from event streams and severely blurred images. This method jointly learns the parameters of these Gaussians while recovering camera motion trajectories during exposure time. Specifically, we first construct a blur loss function by synthesizing multiple latent sharp images during the exposure time, minimizing the difference between real and synthesized blurred images. Then we use event stream to supervise the light intensity changes between latent sharp images at any time within the exposure period, supplementing the light intensity dynamic changes lost in RGB images. Furthermore, we optimize the latent sharp images at intermediate exposure times based on the event-based double integral (EDI) prior, applying consistency constraints to enhance the details and texture information of the reconstructed images. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that EBAD-Gaussian can achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction under the condition of blurred images and event stream inputs.

  Remote sensing spatiotemporal fusion (STF) addresses the fundamental trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution by combining high temporal-low spatial and high spatial-low temporal imagery. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of deep learning advances in remote sensing STF over the past decade. We establish a systematic taxonomy of deep learning architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and sequence models, revealing significant growth in deep learning adoption for STF tasks. Our analysis reveals that CNN-based methods dominate spatial feature extraction, while Transformer architectures show superior performance in capturing long-range temporal dependencies. GAN and diffusion models demonstrate exceptional capability in detail reconstruction, substantially outperforming traditional methods in structural similarity and spectral fidelity. Through comprehensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets comparing ten representative methods, we validate these findings and quantify the performance trade-offs between different approaches. We identify five critical challenges: time-space conflicts, limited generalization across datasets, computational efficiency for large-scale processing, multi-source heterogeneous fusion, and insufficient benchmark diversity. The survey highlights promising opportunities in foundation models, hybrid architectures, and self-supervised learning approaches that could address current limitations and enable multimodal applications.

  Hyperspectral images (HSIs) often suffer from diverse and unknown degradations during imaging, leading to severe spectral and spatial distortions. Existing HSI restoration methods typically rely on specific degradation assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose \textbf{MP-HSIR}, a novel multi-prompt framework that effectively integrates spectral, textual, and visual prompts to achieve universal HSI restoration across diverse degradation types and intensities. Specifically, we develop a prompt-guided spatial-spectral transformer, which incorporates spatial self-attention and a prompt-guided dual-branch spectral self-attention. Since degradations affect spectral features differently, we introduce spectral prompts in the local spectral branch to provide universal low-rank spectral patterns as prior knowledge for enhancing spectral reconstruction. Furthermore, the text-visual synergistic prompt fuses high-level semantic representations with fine-grained visual features to encode degradation information, thereby guiding the restoration process. Extensive experiments on 9 HSI restoration tasks, including all-in-one scenarios, generalization tests, and real-world cases, demonstrate that MP-HSIR not only consistently outperforms existing all-in-one methods but also surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific approaches across multiple tasks. The code and models are available atthis https URL.

  Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations have demonstrated remarkable performance in novel view synthesis; further, material-lighting disentanglement on 3DGS warrants relighting capabilities and its adaptability to broader applications. While the general approach to the latter operation lies in integrating differentiable physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques to jointly recover BRDF materials and environment lighting, achieving a precise disentanglement remains an inherently difficult task due to the challenge of accurately modeling light transport. Existing approaches typically approximate Gaussian points' normals, which constitute an implicit geometric constraint. However, they usually suffer from inaccuracies in normal estimation that subsequently degrade light transport, resulting in noisy material decomposition and flawed relighting results. To address this, we propose GeoSplatting, a novel approach that augments 3DGS with explicit geometry guidance for precise light transport modeling. By differentiably constructing a surface-grounded 3DGS from an optimizable mesh, our approach leverages well-defined mesh normals and the opaque mesh surface, and additionally facilitates the use of mesh-based ray tracing techniques for efficient, occlusion-aware light transport calculations. This enhancement ensures precise material decomposition while preserving the efficiency and high-quality rendering capabilities of 3DGS. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoSplatting, highlighting its superior efficiency and state-of-the-art inverse rendering performance.
