- **[Synthetic Dataset Generation for Autonomous Mobile Robots Using 3D Gaussian Splatting for Vision Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05092)**  `arXiv:2506.05092`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  Annotated datasets are critical for training neural networks for object detection, yet their manual creation is time- and labour-intensive, subjective to human error, and often limited in diversity. This challenge is particularly pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data. Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training data.

- **[AquaticVision: Benchmarking Visual SLAM in Underwater Environment with Events and Frames](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03448)**  `arXiv:2505.03448`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many underwater applications, such as offshore asset inspections, rely on visual inspection and detailed 3D reconstruction. Recent advancements in underwater visual SLAM systems for aquatic environments have garnered significant attention in marine robotics research. However, existing underwater visual SLAM datasets often lack groundtruth trajectory data, making it difficult to objectively compare the performance of different SLAM algorithms based solely on qualitative results or COLMAP reconstruction. In this paper, we present a novel underwater dataset that includes ground truth trajectory data obtained using a motion capture system. Additionally, for the first time, we release visual data that includes both events and frames for benchmarking underwater visual positioning. By providing event camera data, we aim to facilitate the development of more robust and advanced underwater visual SLAM algorithms. The use of event cameras can help mitigate challenges posed by extremely low light or hazy underwater conditions. The webpage of our dataset isthis https URL.

- **[Psi-Sampler: Initial Particle Sampling for SMC-Based Inference-Time Reward Alignment in Score Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01320)**  `arXiv:2506.01320`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Taehoon Yoon, Yunhong Min, Kyeongmin Yeo, Minhyuk Sung_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce $\Psi$-Sampler, an SMC-based framework incorporating pCNL-based initial particle sampling for effective inference-time reward alignment with a score-based generative model. Inference-time reward alignment with score-based generative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader paradigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of this trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising process. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the Gaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results in reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the reward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable posterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines dimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach enables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves performance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image generation, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as demonstrated in our experiments.

- **[Can Large Language Models Understand Intermediate Representations in Compilers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06854)**  `arXiv:2502.06854`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Hailong Jiang, Jianfeng Zhu, Yao Wan, Bo Fang, Hongyu Zhang, Ruoming Jin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Intermediate Representations (IRs) play a critical role in compiler design and program analysis, yet their comprehension by Large Language Models (LLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we present an explorative empirical study evaluating the capabilities of six state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-4, GPT-3, DeepSeek, Gemma 2, Llama 3, and Code Llama, in understanding IRs. Specifically, we assess model performance across four core tasks: control flow graph reconstruction, decompilation, code summarization, and execution reasoning. While LLMs exhibit competence in parsing IR syntax and identifying high-level structures, they consistently struggle with instruction-level reasoning, especially in control flow reasoning, loop handling, and dynamic execution. Common failure modes include misinterpreting branching instructions, omitting critical operations, and relying on heuristic reasoning rather than precise instruction-level logic. Our findings highlight the need for IR-specific enhancements in LLM design. We recommend fine-tuning on structured IR datasets and integrating control-flow-sensitive architectures to improve model effectiveness. All experimental data and source code are publicly available at

- **[Sparse Autoencoders, Again?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04859)**  `arXiv:2506.04859`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yin Lu, Tong He, Xuening Zhu, David Wipf_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)? Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

- **[Train One Sparse Autoencoder Across Multiple Sparsity Budgets to Preserve Interpretability and Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24473)**  `arXiv:2505.24473`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Nikita Balagansky, Yaroslav Aksenov, Daniil Laptev, Vadim Kurochkin, Gleb Gerasimov, Nikita Koryagin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven to be powerful tools for interpreting neural networks by decomposing hidden representations into disentangled, interpretable features via sparsity constraints. However, conventional SAEs are constrained by the fixed sparsity level chosen during training; meeting different sparsity requirements therefore demands separate models and increases the computational footprint during both training and evaluation. We introduce a novel training objective, \emph{HierarchicalTopK}, which trains a single SAE to optimise reconstructions across multiple sparsity levels simultaneously. Experiments with Gemma-2 2B demonstrate that our approach achieves Pareto-optimal trade-offs between sparsity and explained variance, outperforming traditional SAEs trained at individual sparsity levels. Further analysis shows that HierarchicalTopK preserves high interpretability scores even at higher sparsity. The proposed objective thus closes an important gap between flexibility and interpretability in SAE design.

- **[CurvGAD: Leveraging Curvature for Enhanced Graph Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08605)**  `arXiv:2502.08605`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Karish Grover, Geoffrey J. Gordon, Christos Faloutsos_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Does the intrinsic curvature of complex networks hold the key to unveiling graph anomalies that conventional approaches overlook? Reconstruction-based graph anomaly detection (GAD) methods overlook such geometric outliers, focusing only on structural and attribute-level anomalies. To this end, we propose CurvGAD - a mixed-curvature graph autoencoder that introduces the notion of curvature-based geometric anomalies. CurvGAD introduces two parallel pipelines for enhanced anomaly interpretability: (1) Curvature-equivariant geometry reconstruction, which focuses exclusively on reconstructing the edge curvatures using a mixed-curvature, Riemannian encoder and Gaussian kernel-based decoder; and (2) Curvature-invariant structure and attribute reconstruction, which decouples structural and attribute anomalies from geometric irregularities by regularizing graph curvature under discrete Ollivier-Ricci flow, thereby isolating the non-geometric anomalies. By leveraging curvature, CurvGAD refines the existing anomaly classifications and identifies new curvature-driven anomalies. Extensive experimentation over 10 real-world datasets (both homophilic and heterophilic) demonstrates an improvement of up to 6.5% over state-of-the-art GAD methods.

- **[Evaluating Sparse Autoencoders: From Shallow Design to Matching Pursuit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05239)**  `arXiv:2506.05239`  `cs.LG`  
  _Val√©rie Costa, Thomas Fel, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Bahareh Tolooshams, Demba Ba_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse, interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction as more atoms are selected.

- **[Enhanced Drought Analysis in Bangladesh: A Machine Learning Approach for Severity Classification Using Satellite Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04696)**  `arXiv:2506.04696`  `cs.LG`  
  _Tonmoy Paul, Mrittika Devi Mati, Md. Mahmudul Islam_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature, limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh, lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data (humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and predicting drought conditions.

- **[Noise-Resistant Label Reconstruction Feature Selection for Partial Multi-Label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04669)**  `arXiv:2506.04669`  `cs.LG`  
  _Wanfu Gao, Hanlin Pan, Qingqi Han, Kunpeng Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns, which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However, low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally, representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability to these labels. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

- **[Connecting Thompson Sampling and UCB: Towards More Efficient Trade-offs Between Privacy and Regret](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02383)**  `arXiv:2505.02383`  `cs.LG`  
  _Bingshan Hu, Zhiming Huang, Tianyue H. Zhang, Mathias L√©cuyer, Nidhi Hegde_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We address differentially private stochastic bandit problems from the angles of exploring the deep connections among Thompson Sampling with Gaussian priors, Gaussian mechanisms, and Gaussian differential privacy (GDP). We propose DP-TS-UCB, a novel parametrized private bandit algorithm that enables to trade off privacy and regret. DP-TS-UCB satisfies $ \tilde{O} \left(T^{0.25(1-\alpha)}\right)$-GDP and enjoys an $O \left(K\ln^{\alpha+1}(T)/\Delta \right)$ regret bound, where $\alpha \in [0,1]$ controls the trade-off between privacy and regret. Theoretically, our DP-TS-UCB relies on anti-concentration bounds of Gaussian distributions and links exploration mechanisms in Thompson Sampling-based algorithms and Upper Confidence Bound-based algorithms, which may be of independent interest.

- **[Blink of an eye: a simple theory for feature localization in generative models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00921)**  `arXiv:2502.00921`  `cs.LG`  
  _Marvin Li, Aayush Karan, Sitan Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models can exhibit unexpected behavior in the blink of an eye. In a recent computer use demo, a language model switched from coding to Googling pictures of Yellowstone, and these sudden shifts in behavior have also been observed in reasoning patterns and jailbreaks. This phenomenon is not unique to autoregressive models: in diffusion models, key features of the final output are decided in narrow ``critical windows'' of the generation process. In this work we develop a simple, unifying theory to explain this phenomenon using the formalism of stochastic localization samplers. We show that it emerges generically as the generation process localizes to a sub-population of the distribution it models.While critical windows have been studied at length in diffusion models, existing theory heavily relies on strong distributional assumptions and the particulars of Gaussian diffusion. In contrast to existing work our theory (1) applies to autoregressive and diffusion models; (2) makes no distributional assumptions; (3) quantitatively improves previous bounds even when specialized to diffusions; and (4) requires basic tools and no stochastic calculus or statistical-physics-based machinery. We also identify an intriguing connection to the all-or-nothing phenomenon from statistical inference. Finally, we validate our predictions empirically for LLMs and find that critical windows often coincide with failures in problem solving for various math and reasoning benchmarks.

- **[A Compressive-Expressive Communication Framework for Compositional Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19182)**  `arXiv:2501.19182`  `cs.LG`  
  _Rafael Elberg, Felipe del Rio, Mircea Petrache, Denis Parra_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Compositional generalization--the ability to interpret novel combinations of familiar elements--is a hallmark of human cognition and language. Despite recent advances, deep neural networks still struggle to acquire this property reliably. In this work, we introduce CELEBI (Compressive-Expressive Language Emergence through a discrete Bottleneck and Iterated learning), a novel self-supervised framework for inducing compositionality in learned representations from pre-trained models, through a reconstruction-based communication game between a sender and a receiver. Building on theories of language emergence, we integrate three mechanisms that jointly promote compressibility, expressivity, and efficiency in the emergent language. First, interactive decoding incentivizes intermediate reasoning by requiring the receiver to produce partial reconstructions after each symbol. Second, a reconstruction-based imitation phase, inspired by iterated learning, trains successive generations of agents to imitate reconstructions rather than messages, enforcing a tighter communication bottleneck. Third, pairwise distance maximization regularizes message diversity by encouraging high distances between messages, with formal links to entropy maximization. Our method significantly improves both the efficiency and compositionality of the learned messages on the Shapes3D and MPI3D datasets, surpassing prior discrete communication frameworks in both reconstruction accuracy and topographic similarity. This work provides new theoretical and empirical evidence for the emergence of structured, generalizable communication protocols from simplicity-based inductive biases.

- **[ViewFusion: Learning Composable Diffusion Models for Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02906)**  `arXiv:2402.02906`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Bernard Spiegl, Andrea Perin, St√©phane Deny, Alexander Ilin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning is providing a wealth of new approaches to the problem of novel view synthesis, from Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) based approaches to end-to-end style architectures. Each approach offers specific strengths but also comes with limitations in their applicability. This work introduces ViewFusion, an end-to-end generative approach to novel view synthesis with unparalleled flexibility. ViewFusion consists in simultaneously applying a diffusion denoising step to any number of input views of a scene, then combining the noise gradients obtained for each view with an (inferred) pixel-weighting mask, ensuring that for each region of the target view only the most informative input views are taken into account. Our approach resolves several limitations of previous approaches by (1) being trainable and generalizing across multiple scenes and object classes, (2) adaptively taking in a variable number of pose-free views at both train and test time, (3) generating plausible views even in severely underdetermined conditions (thanks to its generative nature) -- all while generating views of quality on par or even better than comparable methods. Limitations include not generating a 3D embedding of the scene, resulting in a relatively slow inference speed, and our method only being tested on the relatively small Neural 3D Mesh Renderer dataset.

- **[FreeTimeGS: Free Gaussians at Anytime and Anywhere for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05348)**  `arXiv:2506.05348`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yifan Wang, Peishan Yang, Zhen Xu, Jiaming Sun, Zhanhua Zhang, Yong Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin.

  _Anagh Malik, Benjamin Attal, Andrew Xie, Matthew O'Toole, David B. Lindell_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering from multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light. Our approach relies on a time-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that accelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at any point from any direction. The resulting model accurately accounts for direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel capabilities such as multi-view time-resolved relighting of captured scenes.

- **[Revisiting Depth Representations for Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05327)**  `arXiv:2506.05327`  `cs.CV`  
  _Duochao Shi, Weijie Wang, Donny Y. Chen, Zeyu Zhang, Jia-Wang Bian, Bohan Zhuang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Depth maps are widely used in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) pipelines by unprojecting them into 3D point clouds for novel view synthesis. This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map, our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results.

  _Daniel Rho, Jun Myeong Choi, Biswadip Dey, Roni Sengupta_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural rendering has made significant strides in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. With the integration with physics, it opens up new applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data, however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable, real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization, directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We propose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually increases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity, leading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state, and material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show that ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding.

- **[AliTok: Towards Sequence Modeling Alignment between Tokenizer and Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05289)**  `arXiv:2506.05289`  `cs.CV`  
  _Pingyu Wu, Kai Zhu, Yu Liu, Longxiang Tang, Jian Yang, Yansong Peng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on previous ones. However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore, by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35, surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling speed.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D shape completion has broad applications in robotics, digital twin reconstruction, and extended reality (XR). Although recent advances in 3D object and scene completion have achieved impressive results, existing methods lack 3D consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle to capture sharp object boundaries. Our work (RaySt3R) addresses these limitations by recasting 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem. Specifically, given a single RGB-D image and a novel viewpoint (encoded as a collection of query rays), we train a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object masks, and per-pixel confidence scores for those query rays. RaySt3R fuses these predictions across multiple query views to reconstruct complete 3D shapes. We evaluate RaySt3R on synthetic and real-world datasets, and observe it achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baselines on all datasets by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance.

- **[Unifying Appearance Codes and Bilateral Grids for Driving Scene Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05280)**  `arXiv:2506.05280`  `cs.CV`  
  _Nan Wang, Yuantao Chen, Lixing Xiao, Weiqing Xiao, Bohan Li, Zhaoxi Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric inconsistency.

- **[DSG-World: Learning a 3D Gaussian World Model from Dual State Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05217)**  `arXiv:2506.05217`  `cs.CV`  
  _Wenhao Hu, Xuexiang Wen, Xi Li, Gaoang Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Building an efficient and physically consistent world model from limited observations is a long standing challenge in vision and robotics. Many existing world modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are hard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand, explicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage processing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to occlusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same scene under different object configurations. These dual states offer complementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions and enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present DSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D Gaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual segmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and semantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for symmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine geometric completeness. DSG-World enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer purely in the explicit Gaussian representation space, supporting high-fidelity rendering and object-level scene manipulation without relying on dense observations or multi-stage pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization to novel views and scene states, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

- **[OGGSplat: Open Gaussian Growing for Generalizable Reconstruction with Expanded Field-of-View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05204)**  `arXiv:2506.05204`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yanbo Wang, Ziyi Wang, Wenzhao Zheng, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes.

  Despite significant advancements in dynamic neural rendering, existing methods fail to address the unique challenges posed by UAV-captured scenarios, particularly those involving monocular camera setups, top-down perspective, and multiple small, moving humans, which are not adequately represented in existing datasets. In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling photorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs. Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans. We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel view synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual sharpness.

  Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of 91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.

  In this paper, we introduce a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for stereo dataset generation, offering an efficient alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods. To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost, high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models. Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.

  We present a new viewpoint on a reconstructing multidimensional geological fields from sparse observations. Drawing inspiration from deterministic image inpainting techniques, we model a partially observed spatial field as a multidimensional tensor and recover missing values by enforcing a global low-rank structure. Our approach combines ideas from tensor completion and geostatistics, providing a robust optimization framework. Experiments on synthetic geological fields demonstrate that used tensor completion method significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy over ordinary kriging for various percent of observed data.

  Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings (e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image 3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization. Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches, establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for multi-modal 3D scene representation.

  Image matching, which establishes correspondences between two-view images to recover 3D structure and camera geometry, serves as a cornerstone in computer vision and underpins a wide range of applications, including visual localization, 3D reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the classical image matching pipeline. Our taxonomy highly aligns with the traditional pipeline in two key aspects: i) the replacement of individual steps in the traditional pipeline with learnable alternatives, including learnable detector-descriptor, outlier filter, and geometric estimator; and ii) the merging of multiple steps into end-to-end learnable modules, encompassing middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, and pose regressor. We first examine the design principles, advantages, and limitations of both aspects, and then benchmark representative methods on relative pose recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks. Finally, we discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research. By systematically categorizing and evaluating deep learning-driven strategies, this survey offers a clear overview of the evolving image matching landscape and highlights key avenues for further innovation.

  3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail, accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality. We will make the code and dataset available.

  Most existing vision encoders map images into a fixed-length sequence of tokens, overlooking the fact that different images contain varying amounts of information. For example, a visually complex image (e.g., a cluttered room) inherently carries more information and thus deserves more tokens than a simple image (e.g., a blank wall). To address this inefficiency, we propose DOVE, a dynamic vision encoder that produces a variable number of visual tokens (i.e., continuous representation vectors) to reconstruct each image. Our results show that DOVE significantly reduces the average number of tokens while maintaining high reconstruction quality. In several linear probing and downstream multimodal tasks, it outperforms existing autoencoder-based tokenization methods when using far fewer tokens, capturing more expressive semantic features compared to fixed-length encoding. We further extend DOVE with query-conditioned tokenization. By guiding the model to focus on query-relevant regions, it achieves more efficient and targeted semantic extraction. Our code and checkpoints are available atthis https URL.

  In Omnimatte, one aims to decompose a given video into semantically meaningful layers, including the background and individual objects along with their associated effects, such as shadows and reflections. Existing methods often require extensive training or costly self-supervised optimization. In this paper, we present OmnimatteZero, a training-free approach that leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained video diffusion models for omnimatte. It can remove objects from videos, extract individual object layers along with their effects, and composite those objects onto new videos. These are accomplished by adapting zero-shot image inpainting techniques for video object removal, a task they fail to handle effectively out-of-the-box. To overcome this, we introduce temporal and spatial attention guidance modules that steer the diffusion process for accurate object removal and temporally consistent background reconstruction. We further show that self-attention maps capture information about the object and its footprints and use them to inpaint the object's effects, leaving a clean background. Additionally, through simple latent arithmetic, object layers can be isolated and recombined seamlessly with new video layers to produce new videos. Evaluations show that OmnimatteZero not only achieves superior performance in terms of background reconstruction but also sets a new record for the fastest Omnimatte approach, achieving real-time performance with minimal frame runtime.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses the problem of weakly supervised cross-view localization, where the goal is to estimate the pose of a ground camera relative to a satellite image with noisy ground truth annotations. A common approach to bridge the cross-view domain gap for pose estimation is Bird's-Eye View (BEV) synthesis. However, existing methods struggle with height ambiguity due to the lack of depth information in ground images and satellite height maps. Previous solutions either assume a flat ground plane or rely on complex models, such as cross-view transformers. We propose BevSplat, a novel method that resolves height ambiguity by using feature-based Gaussian primitives. Each pixel in the ground image is represented by a 3D Gaussian with semantic and spatial features, which are synthesized into a BEV feature map for relative pose estimation. Additionally, to address challenges with panoramic query images, we introduce an icosphere-based supervision strategy for the Gaussian primitives. We validate our method on the widely used KITTI and VIGOR datasets, which include both pinhole and panoramic query images. Experimental results show that BevSplat significantly improves localization accuracy over prior approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of mining patterns among data features in the form of logical rules, with applications across a myriad of domains. However, high-dimensional datasets often result in an excessive number of rules, increasing execution time and negatively impacting downstream task performance. Managing this rule explosion remains a central challenge in ARM research. To address this, we introduce Aerial+, a novel neurosymbolic ARM method. Aerial+ leverages an under-complete autoencoder to create a neural representation of the data, capturing associations between features. It extracts rules from this neural representation by exploiting the model's reconstruction mechanism. Extensive evaluations on five datasets against seven baselines demonstrate that Aerial+ achieves state-of-the-art results by learning more concise, high-quality rule sets with full data coverage. When integrated into rule-based interpretable machine learning models, Aerial+ significantly reduces execution time while maintaining or improving accuracy.
