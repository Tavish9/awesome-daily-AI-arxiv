- **[MobileUse: A GUI Agent with Hierarchical Reflection for Autonomous Mobile Operation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16853)**  `arXiv:2507.16853`  `cs.RO` `cs.MA`  
  _Ning Li, Xiangmou Qu, Jiamu Zhou, Jun Wang, Muning Wen, Kounianhua Du, et al._

  Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled the development of mobile agents that can understand visual inputs and follow user instructions, unlocking new possibilities for automating complex tasks on mobile devices. However, applying these models to real-world mobile scenarios remains a significant challenge due to the long-horizon task execution, difficulty in error recovery, and the cold-start problem in unfamiliar environments. To address these challenges, we propose MobileUse, a GUI agent designed for robust and adaptive mobile task execution. To improve resilience in long-horizon tasks and dynamic environments, we introduce a hierarchical reflection architecture that enables the agent to self-monitor, detect, and recover from errors across multiple temporal scales-ranging from individual actions to overall task completion-while maintaining efficiency through a reflection-on-demand strategy. To tackle cold-start issues, we further introduce a proactive exploration module, which enriches the agent's understanding of the environment through self-planned exploration. Evaluations on AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks demonstrate that MobileUse establishes new state-of-the-art performance, achieving success rates of 62.9% and 44.2%, respectively. To facilitate real-world applications, we release an out-of-the-box toolkit for automated task execution on physical mobile devices, which is available atthis https URL.

- **[InstructVLA: Vision-Language-Action Instruction Tuning from Understanding to Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17520)**  `arXiv:2507.17520`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To operate effectively in the real world, robots must integrate multimodal reasoning with precise action generation. However, existing vision-language-action (VLA) models often sacrifice one for the other, narrow their abilities to task-specific manipulation data, and suffer catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained vision-language capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce InstructVLA, an end-to-end VLA model that preserves the flexible reasoning of large vision-language models (VLMs) while delivering leading manipulation performance. InstructVLA introduces a novel training paradigm, Vision-Language-Action Instruction Tuning (VLA-IT), which employs multimodal training with mixture-of-experts adaptation to jointly optimize textual reasoning and action generation on both standard VLM corpora and a curated 650K-sample VLA-IT dataset. On in-domain SimplerEnv tasks, InstructVLA achieves 30.5% improvement over SpatialVLA. To evaluate generalization, we introduce SimplerEnv-Instruct, an 80-task benchmark requiring closed-loop control and high-level instruction understanding, where it outperforms a fine-tuned OpenVLA by 92% and an action expert aided by GPT-4o by 29%. Additionally, InstructVLA surpasses baseline VLMs on multimodal tasks and exhibits inference-time scaling by leveraging textual reasoning to boost manipulation performance in both simulated and real-world settings. These results demonstrate InstructVLA's potential for bridging intuitive and steerable human-robot interaction with efficient policy learning.

- **[ICCO: Learning an Instruction-conditioned Coordinator for Language-guided Task-aligned Multi-robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12122)**  `arXiv:2503.12122`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Yoshiki Yano, Kazuki Shibata, Maarten Kokshoorn, Takamitsu Matsubara_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have permitted the development of language-guided multi-robot systems, which allow robots to execute tasks based on natural language instructions. However, achieving effective coordination in distributed multi-agent environments remains challenging due to (1) misalignment between instructions and task requirements and (2) inconsistency in robot behaviors when they independently interpret ambiguous instructions. To address these challenges, we propose Instruction-Conditioned Coordinator (ICCO), a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework designed to enhance coordination in language-guided multi-robot systems. ICCO consists of a Coordinator agent and multiple Local Agents, where the Coordinator generates Task-Aligned and Consistent Instructions (TACI) by integrating language instructions with environmental states, ensuring task alignment and behavioral consistency. The Coordinator and Local Agents are jointly trained to optimize a reward function that balances task efficiency and instruction following. A Consistency Enhancement Term is added to the learning objective to maximize mutual information between instructions and robot behaviors, further improving coordination. Simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of ICCO in achieving language-guided task-aligned multi-robot control. The demonstration can be found atthis https URL.

- **[Onto-LLM-TAMP: Knowledge-oriented Task and Motion Planning using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07493)**  `arXiv:2412.07493`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Muhayy Ud Din, Jan Rosell, Waseem Akram, Isiah Zaplana, Maximo A Roa, Irfan Hussain_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Performing complex manipulation tasks in dynamic environments requires efficient Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approaches that combine high-level symbolic plans with low-level motion control. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, are transforming task planning by offering natural language as an intuitive and flexible way to describe tasks, generate symbolic plans, and reason. However, the effectiveness of LLM-based TAMP approaches is limited due to static and template-based prompting, which limits adaptability to dynamic environments and complex task contexts. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel Onto-LLM-TAMP framework that employs knowledge-based reasoning to refine and expand user prompts with task-contextual reasoning and knowledge-based environment state descriptions. Integrating domain-specific knowledge into the prompt ensures semantically accurate and context-aware task plans. The proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness by resolving semantic errors in symbolic plan generation, such as maintaining logical temporal goal ordering in scenarios involving hierarchical object placement. The proposed framework is validated through both simulation and real-world scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements over the baseline approach in terms of adaptability to dynamic environments and the generation of semantically correct task plans.

- **[Language-Conditioned Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation with Pretrained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17379)**  `arXiv:2507.17379`  `cs.RO`  
  _Shen Tan, Dong Zhou, Xiangyu Shao, Junqiao Wang, Guanghui Sun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-vocabulary mobile manipulation (OVMM) that involves the handling of novel and unseen objects across different workspaces remains a significant challenge for real-world robotic applications. In this paper, we propose a novel Language-conditioned Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation framework, named LOVMM, incorporating the large language model (LLM) and vision-language model (VLM) to tackle various mobile manipulation tasks in household environments. Our approach is capable of solving various OVMM tasks with free-form natural language instructions (e.g. "toss the food boxes on the office room desk to the trash bin in the corner", and "pack the bottles from the bed to the box in the guestroom"). Extensive experiments simulated in complex household environments show strong zero-shot generalization and multi-task learning abilities of LOVMM. Moreover, our approach can also generalize to multiple tabletop manipulation tasks and achieve better success rates compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

- **[AquaChat: An LLM-Guided ROV Framework for Adaptive Inspection of Aquaculture Net Pens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16841)**  `arXiv:2507.16841`  `cs.RO`  
  _Waseem Akram, Muhayy Ud Din, Abdelhaleem Saad, Irfan Hussain_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inspection of aquaculture net pens is essential for maintaining the structural integrity, biosecurity, and operational efficiency of fish farming systems. Traditional inspection approaches rely on pre-programmed missions or manual control, offering limited adaptability to dynamic underwater conditions and user-specific demands. In this study, we propose AquaChat, a novel Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent and adaptive net pen inspection. The system features a multi-layered architecture: (1) a high-level planning layer that interprets natural language user commands using an LLM to generate symbolic task plans; (2) a mid-level task manager that translates plans into ROV control sequences; and (3) a low-level motion control layer that executes navigation and inspection tasks with precision. Real-time feedback and event-triggered replanning enhance robustness in challenging aquaculture environments. The framework is validated through experiments in both simulated and controlled aquatic environments representative of aquaculture net pens. Results demonstrate improved task flexibility, inspection accuracy, and operational efficiency. AquaChat illustrates the potential of integrating language-based AI with marine robotics to enable intelligent, user-interactive inspection systems for sustainable aquaculture operations.

- **[Resilient Multi-Agent Negotiation for Medical Supply Chains:Integrating LLMs and Blockchain for Transparent Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17134)**  `arXiv:2507.17134`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI`  
  _Mariam ALMutairi, Hyungmin Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Global health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have exposed critical weaknesses in traditional medical supply chains, including inefficiencies in resource allocation, lack of transparency, and poor adaptability to dynamic disruptions. This paper presents a novel hybrid framework that integrates blockchain technology with a decentralized, large language model (LLM) powered multi-agent negotiation system to enhance the resilience and accountability of medical supply chains during crises. In this system, autonomous agents-representing manufacturers, distributors, and healthcare institutions-engage in structured, context-aware negotiation and decision-making processes facilitated by LLMs, enabling rapid and ethical allocation of scarce medical resources. The off-chain agent layer supports adaptive reasoning and local decision-making, while the on-chain blockchain layer ensures immutable, transparent, and auditable enforcement of decisions via smart contracts. The framework also incorporates a formal cross-layer communication protocol to bridge decentralized negotiation with institutional enforcement. A simulation environment emulating pandemic scenarios evaluates the system's performance, demonstrating improvements in negotiation efficiency, fairness of allocation, supply chain responsiveness, and auditability. This research contributes an innovative approach that synergizes blockchain trust guarantees with the adaptive intelligence of LLM-driven agents, providing a robust and scalable solution for critical supply chain coordination under uncertainty.

- **[DNT: a Deeply Normalized Transformer that can be trained by Momentum SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17501)**  `arXiv:2507.17501`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL` `cs.CV`  
  _Xianbiao Qi, Marco Chen, Wenjie Xiao, Jiaquan Ye, Yelin He, Chun-Guang Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformers have become the de facto backbone of modern deep learning, yet their training typically demands an advanced optimizer with adaptive learning rate like AdamW, rather than a momentum SGDW (mSGDW). Previous works show that it is mainly due to a heavy-tailed distribution of the gradients. In this paper, we introduce a Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT), which is meticulously engineered to overcome this limitation enabling seamless training with vanilla mSGDW while yielding comparable performance to the Transformers trained via AdamW. To be specific, in DNT, we strategically integrate normalization techniques at proper positions in the Transformers to effectively modulate the Jacobian matrices of each layer, balance the influence of weights, activations, and their interactions, and thus enable the distributions of gradients concentrated. We provide both theoretical justifications of the normalization technique used in our DNT and extensive empirical evaluation on two popular Transformer architectures to validate that: a) DNT outperforms its counterparts (\ie, ViT and GPT), and b) DNT can be effectively trained with vanilla mSGDW.

- **[SiLQ: Simple Large Language Model Quantization-Aware Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16933)**  `arXiv:2507.16933`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Steven K. Esser, Jeffrey L. McKinstry, Deepika Bablani, Rathinakumar Appuswamy, Dharmendra S. Modha_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models can be quantized to reduce inference time latency, model size, and energy consumption, thereby delivering a better user experience at lower cost. A challenge exists to deliver quantized models with minimal loss of accuracy in reasonable time, and in particular to do so without requiring mechanisms incompatible with specialized inference accelerators. Here, we demonstrate a simple, end-to-end quantization-aware training approach that, with an increase in total model training budget of less than 0.1%, outperforms the leading published quantization methods by large margins on several modern benchmarks, with both base and instruct model variants. The approach easily generalizes across different model architectures, can be applied to activations, cache, and weights, and requires the introduction of no additional operations to the model other than the quantization itself.

  _Gabriel J. Perin, Runjin Chen, Xuxi Chen, Nina S. T. Hirata, Zhangyang Wang, Junyuan Hong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available atthis http URL.

- **[How Should We Meta-Learn Reinforcement Learning Algorithms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17668)**  `arXiv:2507.17668`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Alexander David Goldie, Zilin Wang, Jakob Nicolaus Foerster, Shimon Whiteson_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The process of meta-learning algorithms from data, instead of relying on manual design, is growing in popularity as a paradigm for improving the performance of machine learning systems. Meta-learning shows particular promise for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are often adapted from supervised or unsupervised learning despite their suboptimality for RL. However, until now there has been a severe lack of comparison between different meta-learning algorithms, such as using evolution to optimise over black-box functions or LLMs to propose code. In this paper, we carry out this empirical comparison of the different approaches when applied to a range of meta-learned algorithms which target different parts of the RL pipeline. In addition to meta-train and meta-test performance, we also investigate factors including the interpretability, sample cost and train time for each meta-learning algorithm. Based on these findings, we propose several guidelines for meta-learning new RL algorithms which will help ensure that future learned algorithms are as performant as possible.

- **[HOTA: Hamiltonian framework for Optimal Transport Advection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17513)**  `arXiv:2507.17513`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Nazar Buzun, Daniil Shlenskii, Maxim Bobrin, Dmitry V. Dylov_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Optimal transport (OT) has become a natural framework for guiding the probability flows. Yet, the majority of recent generative models assume trivial geometry (e.g., Euclidean) and rely on strong density-estimation assumptions, yielding trajectories that do not respect the true principles of optimality in the underlying manifold. We present Hamiltonian Optimal Transport Advection (HOTA), a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman based method that tackles the dual dynamical OT problem explicitly through Kantorovich potentials, enabling efficient and scalable trajectory optimization. Our approach effectively evades the need for explicit density modeling, performing even when the cost functionals are non-smooth. Empirically, HOTA outperforms all baselines in standard benchmarks, as well as in custom datasets with non-differentiable costs, both in terms of feasibility and optimality.

- **[DynaSearcher: Dynamic Knowledge Graph Augmented Search Agent via Multi-Reward Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17365)**  `arXiv:2507.17365`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Chuzhan Hao, Wenfeng Feng, Yuewei Zhang, Hao Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-step agentic retrieval systems based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex information search tasks. However, these systems still face significant challenges in practical applications, particularly in generating factually inconsistent intermediate queries and inefficient search trajectories, which can lead to reasoning deviations or redundant computations. To address these issues, we propose DynaSearcher, an innovative search agent enhanced by dynamic knowledge graphs and multi-reward reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our system leverages knowledge graphs as external structured knowledge to guide the search process by explicitly modeling entity relationships, thereby ensuring factual consistency in intermediate queries and mitigating biases from irrelevant information. Furthermore, we employ a multi-reward RL framework for fine-grained control over training objectives such as retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and response quality. This framework promotes the generation of high-quality intermediate queries and comprehensive final answers, while discouraging unnecessary exploration and minimizing information omissions or redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art answer accuracy on six multi-hop question answering datasets, matching frontier LLMs while using only small-scale models and limited computational resources. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong generalization and robustness across diverse retrieval environments and larger-scale models, highlighting its broad applicability.

  _Rishi Parekh, Saisubramaniam Gopalakrishnan, Zishan Ahmad, Anirudh Deodhar_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Analyzing large, complex output datasets from Discrete Event Simulations (DES) of warehouse operations to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies is a critical yet challenging task, often demanding significant manual effort or specialized analytical tools. Our framework integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to analyze complex Discrete Event Simulation (DES) output data from warehouse operations. It transforms raw DES data into a semantically rich KG, capturing relationships between simulation events and entities. An LLM-based agent uses iterative reasoning, generating interdependent sub-questions. For each sub-question, it creates Cypher queries for KG interaction, extracts information, and self-reflects to correct errors. This adaptive, iterative, and self-correcting process identifies operational issues mimicking human analysis. Our DES approach for warehouse bottleneck identification, tested with equipment breakdowns and process irregularities, outperforms baseline methods. For operational questions, it achieves near-perfect pass rates in pinpointing inefficiencies. For complex investigative questions, we demonstrate its superior diagnostic ability to uncover subtle, interconnected issues. This work bridges simulation modeling and AI (KG+LLM), offering a more intuitive method for actionable insights, reducing time-to-insight, and enabling automated warehouse inefficiency evaluation and diagnosis.

- **[Enabling Self-Improving Agents to Learn at Test Time With Human-In-The-Loop Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17131)**  `arXiv:2507.17131`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yufei He, Ruoyu Li, Alex Chen, Yue Liu, Yulin Chen, Yuan Sui, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language model (LLM) agents often struggle in environments where rules and required domain knowledge frequently change, such as regulatory compliance and user risk screening. Current approaches, like offline fine-tuning and standard prompting, are insufficient because they cannot effectively adapt to new knowledge during actual operation. To address this limitation, we propose the Adaptive Reflective Interactive Agent (ARIA), an LLM agent framework designed specifically to continuously learn updated domain knowledge at test time. ARIA assesses its own uncertainty through structured self-dialogue, proactively identifying knowledge gaps and requesting targeted explanations or corrections from human experts. It then systematically updates an internal, timestamped knowledge repository with provided human guidance, detecting and resolving conflicting or outdated knowledge through comparisons and clarification queries. We evaluate ARIA on the realistic customer due diligence name screening task on TikTok Pay, alongside publicly available dynamic knowledge tasks. Results demonstrate significant improvements in adaptability and accuracy compared to baselines using standard offline fine-tuning and existing self-improving agents. ARIA is deployed within TikTok Pay serving over 150 million monthly active users, confirming its practicality and effectiveness for operational use in rapidly evolving environments.

  _Andrii Balashov_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) is a key post-pretraining step for aligning large language models (LLMs) with complex tasks and human preferences. While it is often assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's parameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL fine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of weights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced parameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity constraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI, Meta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show substantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far exceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the pretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers full model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully fine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL operates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted changes. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited effect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts models: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small, consistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods and reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to time series forecasting (TSF) has garnered significant attention among researchers. This study presents a new frame of LLMs named CGF-LLM using GPT-2 combined with fuzzy time series (FTS) and causal graph to predict multivariate time series, marking the first such architecture in the literature. The key objective is to convert numerical time series into interpretable forms through the parallel application of fuzzification and causal analysis, enabling both semantic understanding and structural insight as input for the pretrained GPT-2 model. The resulting textual representation offers a more interpretable view of the complex dynamics underlying the original time series. The reported results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed LLM-based time series forecasting model, as demonstrated across four different multivariate time series datasets. This initiative paves promising future directions in the domain of TSF using LLMs based on FTS.

- **[HydraOpt: Navigating the Efficiency-Performance Trade-off of Adapter Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17706)**  `arXiv:2507.17706`  `cs.LG`  
  _Taha Ceritli, Ondrej Bohdal, Mete Ozay, Jijoong Moon, Kyeng-Hun Lee, Hyeonmok Ko, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often leverage adapters, such as low-rank-based adapters, to achieve strong performance on downstream tasks. However, storing a separate adapter for each task significantly increases memory requirements, posing a challenge for resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices. Although model merging techniques can reduce storage costs, they typically result in substantial performance degradation. In this work, we introduce HydraOpt, a new model merging technique that capitalizes on the inherent similarities between the matrices of low-rank adapters. Unlike existing methods that produce a fixed trade-off between storage size and performance, HydraOpt allows us to navigate this spectrum of efficiency and performance. Our experiments show that HydraOpt significantly reduces storage size (48% reduction) compared to storing all adapters, while achieving competitive performance (0.2-1.8% drop). Furthermore, it outperforms existing merging techniques in terms of performance at the same or slightly worse storage efficiency.

- **[A Comprehensive Evaluation on Quantization Techniques for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17417)**  `arXiv:2507.17417`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For large language models (LLMs), post-training quantization (PTQ) can significantly reduce memory footprint and computational overhead. Model quantization is a rapidly evolving research field. Though many papers have reported breakthrough performance, they may not conduct experiments on the same ground since one quantization method usually contains multiple components. In addition, analyzing the theoretical connections among existing methods is crucial for in-depth understanding. To bridge these gaps, we conduct an extensive review of state-of-the-art methods and perform comprehensive evaluations on the same ground to ensure fair comparisons. To our knowledge, this fair and extensive investigation remains critically important yet underexplored. To better understand the theoretical connections, we decouple the published quantization methods into two steps: pre-quantization transformation and quantization error mitigation. We define the former as a preprocessing step applied before quantization to reduce the impact of outliers, making the data distribution flatter and more suitable for quantization. Quantization error mitigation involves techniques that offset the errors introduced during quantization, thereby enhancing model performance. We evaluate and analyze the impact of different components of quantization methods. Additionally, we analyze and evaluate the latest MXFP4 data format and its performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that optimized rotation and scaling yield the best performance for pre-quantization transformation, and combining low-rank compensation with GPTQ occasionally outperforms using GPTQ alone for quantization error mitigation. Furthermore, we explore the potential of the latest MXFP4 quantization and reveal that the optimal pre-quantization transformation strategy for INT4 does not generalize well to MXFP4, inspiring further investigation.

  Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective content moderation is essential for video platforms to safeguard user experience and uphold community standards. While traditional video classification models effectively handle well-defined moderation tasks, they struggle with complicated scenarios such as implicit harmful content and contextual ambiguity. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a promising solution to these limitations with their superior cross-modal reasoning and contextual understanding. However, two key challenges hinder their industrial adoption. First, the high computational cost of MLLMs makes full-scale deployment impractical. Second, adapting generative models for discriminative classification remains an open research problem. In this paper, we first introduce an efficient method to transform a generative MLLM into a multimodal classifier using minimal discriminative training data. To enable industry-scale deployment, we then propose a router-ranking cascade system that integrates MLLMs with a lightweight router model. Offline experiments demonstrate that our MLLM-based approach improves F1 score by 66.50% over traditional classifiers while requiring only 2% of the fine-tuning data.

  We introduce TD-Interpreter, a specialized ML tool that assists engineers in understanding complex timing diagrams (TDs), originating from a third party, during their design and verification process. TD-Interpreter is a visual question-answer environment which allows engineers to input a set of TDs and ask design and verification queries regarding these TDs. We implemented TD-Interpreter with multimodal learning by fine-tuning LLaVA, a lightweight 7B Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). To address limited training data availability, we developed a synthetic data generation workflow that aligns visual information with its textual interpretation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the usefulness of TD-Interpreter which outperformed untuned GPT-4o by a large margin on the evaluated benchmarks.

  The synergy between symbolic knowledge, often represented by Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and the generative capabilities of neural networks is central to advancing neurosymbolic AI. A primary bottleneck in realizing this potential is the difficulty of automating KG construction, which faces challenges related to output reliability, consistency, and verifiability. These issues can manifest as structural inconsistencies within the generated graphs, such as the formation of disconnected $\textit{isolated islands}$ of data or the inaccurate conflation of abstract classes with specific instances. To address these challenges, we propose HyDRA, a $\textbf{Hy}$brid-$\textbf{D}$riven $\textbf{R}$easoning $\textbf{A}$rchitecture designed for verifiable KG automation. Given a domain or an initial set of documents, HyDRA first constructs an ontology via a panel of collaborative neurosymbolic agents. These agents collaboratively agree on a set of competency questions (CQs) that define the scope and requirements the ontology must be able to answer. Given these CQs, we build an ontology graph that subsequently guides the automated extraction of triplets for KG generation from arbitrary documents. Inspired by design-by-contracts (DbC) principles, our method leverages verifiable contracts as the primary control mechanism to steer the generative process of Large Language Models (LLMs). To verify the output of our approach, we extend beyond standard benchmarks and propose an evaluation framework that assesses the functional correctness of the resulting KG by leveraging symbolic verifications as described by the neurosymbolic AI framework, $\textit{SymbolicAI}$. This work contributes a hybrid-driven architecture for improving the reliability of automated KG construction and the exploration of evaluation methods for measuring the functional integrity of its output. The code is publicly available.

  With the rise of smart mobility and shared e-mobility services, numerous advanced technologies have been applied to this field. Cloud-based traffic simulation solutions have flourished, offering increasingly realistic representations of the evolving mobility landscape. LLMs have emerged as pioneering tools, providing robust support for various applications, including intelligent decision-making, user interaction, and real-time traffic analysis. As user demand for e-mobility continues to grow, delivering comprehensive end-to-end solutions has become crucial. In this paper, we present a cloud-based, LLM-powered shared e-mobility platform, integrated with a mobile application for personalized route recommendations. The optimization module is evaluated based on travel time and cost across different traffic scenarios. Additionally, the LLM-powered RAG framework is evaluated at the schema level for different users, using various evaluation methods. Schema-level RAG with XiYanSQL achieves an average execution accuracy of 0.81 on system operator queries and 0.98 on user queries.

  Drug discovery is a complex process that involves multiple stages and tasks. However, existing molecular generative models can only tackle some of these tasks. We present Generalist Molecular generative model (GenMol), a versatile framework that uses only a single discrete diffusion model to handle diverse drug discovery scenarios. GenMol generates Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) sequences through non-autoregressive bidirectional parallel decoding, thereby allowing the utilization of a molecular context that does not rely on the specific token ordering while having better sampling efficiency. GenMol uses fragments as basic building blocks for molecules and introduces fragment remasking, a strategy that optimizes molecules by regenerating masked fragments, enabling effective exploration of chemical space. We further propose molecular context guidance (MCG), a guidance method tailored for masked discrete diffusion of GenMol. GenMol significantly outperforms the previous GPT-based model in de novo generation and fragment-constrained generation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in goal-directed hit generation and lead optimization. These results demonstrate that GenMol can tackle a wide range of drug discovery tasks, providing a unified and versatile approach for molecular design. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  With Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly approaching and potentially surpassing human-level performance, it has become imperative to develop approaches capable of effectively supervising and enhancing these powerful models using smaller, human-level models exposed to only human-level data. We address this critical weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization challenge by proposing a novel method aimed at improving weak experts, by training on the same limited human-level data, enabling them to generalize to complex, super-human-level tasks. Our approach, called **EnsemW2S**, employs a token-level ensemble strategy that iteratively combines multiple weak experts, systematically addressing the shortcomings identified in preceding iterations. By continuously refining these weak models, we significantly enhance their collective ability to supervise stronger student models. We extensively evaluate the generalization performance of both the ensemble of weak experts and the subsequent strong student model across in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. For OOD, we specifically introduce question difficulty as an additional dimension for defining distributional shifts. Our empirical results demonstrate notable improvements, achieving 4%, and 3.2% improvements on ID datasets and, upto 6% and 2.28% on OOD datasets for experts and student models respectively, underscoring the effectiveness of our proposed method in advancing W2S generalization.

  Real-world 3D scene-level scans offer realism and can enable better real-world generalizability for downstream applications. However, challenges such as data volume, diverse annotation formats, and tool compatibility limit their use. This paper demonstrates a methodology to effectively leverage these scans and their annotations. We propose a unified annotation integration using USD, with application-specific USD flavors. We identify challenges in utilizing holistic real-world scan datasets and present mitigation strategies. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through two downstream applications: LLM-based scene editing, enabling effective LLM understanding and adaptation of the data (80% success), and robotic simulation, achieving an 87% success rate in policy learning.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed a paradigm shift from static prediction systems to agentic AI agents capable of reasoning, interacting with tools, and adapting to complex tasks. While LLM-based agentic systems have shown promise across many domains, their application to medical imaging remains in its infancy. In this work, we introduce AURA, the first visual linguistic explainability agent designed specifically for comprehensive analysis, explanation, and evaluation of medical images. By enabling dynamic interactions, contextual explanations, and hypothesis testing, AURA represents a significant advancement toward more transparent, adaptable, and clinically aligned AI systems. We highlight the promise of agentic AI in transforming medical image analysis from static predictions to interactive decision support. Leveraging Qwen-32B, an LLM-based architecture, AURA integrates a modular toolbox comprising: (i) a segmentation suite with phase grounding, pathology segmentation, and anatomy segmentation to localize clinically meaningful regions; (ii) a counterfactual image-generation module that supports reasoning through image-level explanations; and (iii) a set of evaluation tools including pixel-wise difference-map analysis, classification, and advanced state-of-the-art components to assess diagnostic relevance and visual interpretability.

  Large-scale alignment pipelines typically pair a policy model with a separately trained reward model whose parameters remain frozen during reinforcement learning (RL). This separation creates a complex, resource-intensive pipeline and suffers from a performance ceiling due to a static reward signal. We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy Optimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following ("player") and reward modeling ("referee") within a single model and a single training phase. Our method recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable reasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format optimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This enables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic while simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks. Experiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified model significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative reward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24 to 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66. Furthermore, URPO cultivates a superior internal evaluator as a byproduct of training, achieving a RewardBench score of 85.15 and surpassing the dedicated reward model it replaces (83.55). By eliminating the need for a separate reward model and fostering a co-evolutionary dynamic between generation and evaluation, URPO presents a simpler, more efficient, and more effective path towards robustly aligned language models.

  Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc).The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework.We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.

  Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) aims to localize specified entities or regions in an image based on natural language descriptions. While existing methods handle single-entity localization, they often ignore complex inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, limiting their accuracy and reliability. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets with fine-grained, paired image-text-relation annotations hinders further progress. To address this challenge, we first construct a relation-aware, multi-entity REC dataset called ReMeX, which includes detailed relationship and textual annotations. We then propose ReMeREC, a novel framework that jointly leverages visual and textual cues to localize multiple entities while modeling their inter-relations. To address the semantic ambiguity caused by implicit entity boundaries in language, we introduce the Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron (TMP), which dynamically infers both the quantity and span of entities from fine-grained textual cues, producing distinctive representations. Additionally, our Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) enhances relational reasoning and global scene understanding. To further improve language comprehension for fine-grained prompts, we also construct a small-scale auxiliary dataset, EntityText, generated using large language models. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that ReMeREC achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-entity grounding and relation prediction, outperforming existing approaches by a large margin.

  Achieving human-like perception and reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence. While recent research has primarily focused on enhancing reasoning capabilities in MLLMs, a fundamental question persists: Can Multimodal Large Language Models truly perceive the world as humans do? This paper shifts focus from reasoning to perception. Rather than constructing benchmarks specifically for reasoning, we introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented benchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on synthetic images that humans process intuitively. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on our perceptual tasks trivial for humans. Both in-context learning and training on language backbone-effective for previous benchmarks-fail to improve performance on our tasks, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, suggesting that our benchmark poses challenges for vision tower generalization rather than for the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone-a key gap between current MLLMs and human perception. We release a representative subset of TET tasks in this version, and will introduce more diverse tasks and methods to enhance visual generalization in future work.

  Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset. Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided, yielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form video understanding tasks.

  Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify and locate deviations from normal patterns in video sequences. Traditional methods often struggle with substantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets, thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these constraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring fine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of MLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity and linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To capitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP) mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative hidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning. Then a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently detects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate explanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model generalization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the way for more practical and scalable solutions.

  Designing high-quality presentation slides can be challenging for non-experts due to the complexity involved in navigating various design choices. Numerous automated tools can suggest layouts and color schemes, yet often lack the ability to refine their own output, which is a key aspect in real-world workflows. We propose DesignLab, which separates the design process into two roles, the design reviewer, who identifies design-related issues, and the design contributor who corrects them. This decomposition enables an iterative loop where the reviewer continuously detects issues and the contributor corrects them, allowing a draft to be further polished with each iteration, reaching qualities that were unattainable. We fine-tune large language models for these roles and simulate intermediate drafts by introducing controlled perturbations, enabling the design reviewer learn design errors and the contributor learn how to fix them. Our experiments show that DesignLab outperforms existing design-generation methods, including a commercial tool, by embracing the iterative nature of designing which can result in polished, professional slides.

  Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved reasoning in text and image domains, yet achieving robust video reasoning remains a significant challenge. Existing video benchmarks mainly assess shallow understanding and reasoning and allow models to exploit global context, failing to rigorously evaluate true causal and stepwise reasoning. We present CausalStep, a benchmark designed for explicit stepwise causal reasoning in videos. CausalStep segments videos into causally linked units and enforces a strict stepwise question-answer (QA) protocol, requiring sequential answers and preventing shortcut solutions. Each question includes carefully constructed distractors based on error type taxonomy to ensure diagnostic value. The benchmark features 100 videos across six categories and 1,852 multiple-choice QA pairs. We introduce seven diagnostic metrics for comprehensive evaluation, enabling precise diagnosis of causal reasoning capabilities. Experiments with leading proprietary and open-source models, as well as human baselines, reveal a significant gap between current models and human-level stepwise reasoning. CausalStep provides a rigorous benchmark to drive progress in robust and interpretable video reasoning.

  The exponential growth of video content has made personalized video highlighting an essential task, as user preferences are highly variable and complex. Existing video datasets, however, often lack personalization, relying on isolated videos or simple text queries that fail to capture the intricacies of user behavior. In this work, we introduce HIPPO-Video, a novel dataset for personalized video highlighting, created using an LLM-based user simulator to generate realistic watch histories reflecting diverse user preferences. The dataset includes 2,040 (watch history, saliency score) pairs, covering 20,400 videos across 170 semantic categories. To validate our dataset, we propose HiPHer, a method that leverages these personalized watch histories to predict preference-conditioned segment-wise saliency scores. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing generic and query-based approaches, showcasing its potential for highly user-centric video highlighting in real-world scenarios.

  Large language models (LLMs) are growingly extended to process multimodal data such as text and video simultaneously. Their remarkable performance in understanding what is shown in images is surpassing specialized neural networks (NNs) such as Yolo that is supporting only a well-formed but very limited vocabulary, ie., objects that they are able to detect. When being non-restricted, LLMs and in particular state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs) show impressive performance to describe even complex traffic situations. This is making them potentially suitable components for automotive perception systems to support the understanding of complex traffic situations or edge case situation. However, LLMs and VLMs are prone to hallucination, which mean to either potentially not seeing traffic agents such as vulnerable road users who are present in a situation, or to seeing traffic agents who are not there in reality. While the latter is unwanted making an ADAS or autonomous driving systems (ADS) to unnecessarily slow down, the former could lead to disastrous decisions from an ADS. In our work, we are systematically assessing the performance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic situations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for capturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe that both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding capabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult to spot for us humans. However, they are also still prone to making up elements in their descriptions to date requiring hallucination detection strategies such as BetterCheck that we propose in our work.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have pushed the frontiers of Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA), yet their reasoning is fundamentally bottlenecked by a reliance on uni-dimensional evidence. This "seeing only the trees, but not the forest" approach prevents robust, multi-faceted understanding. Inspired by the principle of seeing both the forest and trees, we propose Synergos-VQA, a novel synergistic reasoning framework. At its core, Synergos-VQA concurrently generates and fuses three complementary evidence streams at inference time: (1) Holistic Evidence to perceive the entire scene (the "forest"), (2) Structural Evidence from a prototype-driven module to identify key objects (the "trees"), and (3) Causal Evidence from a counterfactual probe to ensure the reasoning is robustly grounded. By synergistically fusing this multi-faceted evidence, our framework achieves a more comprehensive and reliable reasoning process. Extensive experiments show that Synergos-VQA decisively establishes a new state-of-the-art on three challenging benchmarks, including OK-VQA and A-OKVQA. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong plug-and-play capabilities, significantly boosting various open-source MLLMs and proving that superior methodological design can outperform sheer model scale.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robot imitation learning relies on 4D multi-view sequential images. However, the high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely constrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful strategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view sequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we propose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation framework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on single-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core challenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic views and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low computational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical objects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of innovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we introduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that learns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints. Second, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse Spatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views and remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the views to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation, we incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted expert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of VLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.

  In this paper, we introduce VideoNarrator, a novel training-free pipeline designed to generate dense video captions that offer a structured snapshot of video content. These captions offer detailed narrations with precise timestamps, capturing the nuances present in each segment of the video. Despite advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for video comprehension, these models often struggle with temporally aligned narrations and tend to hallucinate, particularly in unfamiliar scenarios. VideoNarrator addresses these challenges by leveraging a flexible pipeline where off-the-shelf MLLMs and visual-language models (VLMs) can function as caption generators, context providers, or caption verifiers. Our experimental results demonstrate that the synergistic interaction of these components significantly enhances the quality and accuracy of video narrations, effectively reducing hallucinations and improving temporal alignment. This structured approach not only enhances video understanding but also facilitates downstream tasks such as video summarization and video question answering, and can be potentially extended for advertising and marketing applications.

  The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data, AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

  Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual grounding in single-image scenarios with textual references. However, their performance degrades when handling real-world applications that involve complex multi-image compositions and multi-modal instructions, revealing limitations in cross-image reasoning and generalization. To address these challenges, we adopt a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based post-training strategy to improve the reasoning of MLLMs in multi-image grounding tasks. Our approach begins with synthesizing high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data for cold-start initialization, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The cold-start training stage enables the model to identify correct solutions. Subsequently, we perform rejection sampling using the merged SFT model to curate high-quality RL data and leverage rule-based RL to guide the model toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, yielding improvements of +9.04% on MIG-Bench, +6.37% on MC-Bench, and +4.98% on several out-of-domain reasoning grounding benchmarks compared to the SFT baseline. Furthermore, our method exhibits strong generalization in multi-image perception, with gains of +3.1% and +2.4% over the base model on BLINK and MMIU benchmarks, respectively.

  Large Language Model (LLM) based multi-agent systems have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, especially when enhanced through collaborative communication. However, current methods often rely on a fixed number of agents and static communication structures, limiting their ability to adapt to varying task complexities. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Graph Pruning (AGP), a novel task-adaptive multi-agent collaboration framework that jointly optimizes agent quantity (hard-pruning) and communication topology (soft-pruning). Specifically, our method employs a two-stage training strategy: firstly, independently training soft-pruning networks for different agent quantities to determine optimal agent-quantity-specific complete graphs and positional masks across specific tasks; and then jointly optimizing hard-pruning and soft-pruning within a maximum complete graph to dynamically configure the number of agents and their communication topologies per task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is: (1) High-performing, achieving state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks and consistently generalizes across multiple mainstream LLM architectures, with a increase in performance of $2.58\%\sim 9.84\%$; (2) Task-adaptive, dynamically constructing optimized communication topologies tailored to specific tasks, with an extremely high performance in all three task categories (general reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation); (3) Token-economical, having fewer training steps and token consumption at the same time, with a decrease in token consumption of $90\%+$; and (4) Training-efficient, achieving high performance with very few training steps compared with other methods. The performance will surpass the existing baselines after about ten steps of training under six benchmarks.

  Recent advances in learning rate (LR) scheduling have demonstrated the effectiveness of decay-free approaches that eliminate the traditional decay phase while maintaining competitive performance. Model merging techniques have emerged as particularly promising solutions in this domain. We present Warmup-Stable and Merge (WSM), a general framework that establishes a formal connection between learning rate decay and model merging. WSM provides a unified theoretical foundation for emulating various decay strategies-including cosine decay, linear decay and inverse square root decay-as principled model averaging schemes, while remaining fully compatible with diverse optimization methods. Through extensive experiments, we identify merge duration-the training window for checkpoint aggregation-as the most critical factor influencing model performance, surpassing the importance of both checkpoint interval and merge quantity. Our framework consistently outperforms the widely-adopted Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) approach across multiple benchmarks, achieving significant improvements of +3.5% on MATH, +2.9% on HumanEval, and +5.5% on MMLU-Pro. The performance advantages extend to supervised fine-tuning scenarios, highlighting WSM's potential for long-term model refinement.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit considerable promise in financial applications; however, prevailing models frequently demonstrate limitations when confronted with scenarios that necessitate sophisticated reasoning capabilities, stringent trustworthiness criteria, and efficient adaptation to domain-specific requirements. We introduce the Agentar-Fin-R1 series of financial large language models (8B and 32B parameters), specifically engineered based on the Qwen3 foundation model to enhance reasoning capabilities, reliability, and domain specialization for financial applications. Our optimization approach integrates a high-quality, systematic financial task label system with a comprehensive multi-layered trustworthiness assurance framework. This framework encompasses high-quality trustworthy knowledge engineering, multi-agent trustworthy data synthesis, and rigorous data validation governance. Through label-guided automated difficulty-aware optimization, tow-stage training pipeline, and dynamic attribution systems, we achieve substantial improvements in training efficiency. Our models undergo comprehensive evaluation on mainstream financial benchmarks including Fineva, FinEval, and FinanceIQ, as well as general reasoning datasets such as MATH-500 and GPQA-diamond. To thoroughly assess real-world deployment capabilities, we innovatively propose the Finova evaluation benchmark, which focuses on agent-level financial reasoning and compliance verification. Experimental results demonstrate that Agentar-Fin-R1 not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on financial tasks but also exhibits exceptional general reasoning capabilities, validating its effectiveness as a trustworthy solution for high-stakes financial applications.

  Large language models (LLMs) turn writing into a live exchange between humans and software. We characterize this new medium as a discursive network that treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements circulate. We define the generation of erroneous information as invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external detection. We develop a general mathematical model of discursive networks that shows that a network governed only by drift and self-repair stabilizes at a modest error rate. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer review with the open-source Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm: a configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a harmonizer merges their verdicts. We identify an ethical transgression, epithesis, that occurs when humans fail to engage in the discursive network. The takeaway is practical and cultural: reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from connecting imperfect ones into networks that enforce mutual accountability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Next token prediction paradigm has been prevailing for autoregressive models in the era of LLMs. The current default sampling choice for popular LLMs is temperature scaling together with nucleus sampling to balance diversity and coherence. Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end, we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident, one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further improve over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the potential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In modern large language models (LLMs), LLM alignment is of crucial importance and is typically achieved through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities, with reinforcement learning (RL) playing a crucial role in this progress. While "aha moment" patterns--where models exhibit self-correction through reflection--are often attributed to emergent properties from RL, we first demonstrate that these patterns exist in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) prior to RL training but may not necessarily correlate with improved reasoning performance. Building on these insights, we present a comprehensive study on enhancing multimodal reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start with structured chain-of-thought reasoning patterns, followed by (2) reinforcement learning via GRPO to further refine these capabilities. Our extensive experiments show that this combined approach consistently outperforms both SFT-only and RL-only methods across challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks. The resulting models achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs at both 3B and 7B scales, with our 7B model showing substantial improvements over base models (e.g., 66.3 %$\rightarrow$73.4 % on MathVista, 62.9 %$\rightarrow$70.4 % on We-Math) and our 3B model achieving performance competitive with several 7B models. Overall, this work provides practical guidance for building advanced multimodal reasoning models. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  AI-generated clinical notes are increasingly used in healthcare, but evaluating their quality remains a challenge due to high subjectivity and limited scalability of expert review. Existing automated metrics often fail to align with real-world physician preferences. To address this, we propose a pipeline that systematically distills real user feedback into structured checklists for note evaluation. These checklists are designed to be interpretable, grounded in human feedback, and enforceable by LLM-based evaluators. Using deidentified data from over 21,000 clinical encounters, prepared in accordance with the HIPAA safe harbor standard, from a deployed AI medical scribe system, we show that our feedback-derived checklist outperforms baseline approaches in our offline evaluations in coverage, diversity, and predictive power for human ratings. Extensive experiments confirm the checklist's robustness to quality-degrading perturbations, significant alignment with clinician preferences, and practical value as an evaluation methodology. In offline research settings, the checklist can help identify notes likely to fall below our chosen quality thresholds.

  Although recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown rapid improvement on reasoning benchmarks in English, the evaluation of such LLMs' multilingual reasoning capability across diverse languages and cultural contexts remains limited. Existing multilingual reasoning benchmarks are typically constructed by translating existing English reasoning benchmarks, biasing these benchmarks towards reasoning problems with context in English language/cultures. In this work, we introduce the Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC), a benchmark designed to assess LLMs on more than 1,000 native, linguistic and culturally grounded reasoning questions written by native speakers in French, Spanish, and Chinese. MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories: language-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition reasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition reasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English equivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation from native speakers fluent in English. This set of English equivalents can provide a direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity in other languages vs. English on the same reasoning questions. We systematically evaluate current 14 leading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent set. The results show that (1) current LLMs are still not good at native multilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC; (2) LLMs exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses in handling linguistic, cultural, and logical reasoning tasks; (3) Most models perform substantially better in math reasoning in English compared to in original languages (+10%), indicating persistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge.

  Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various fields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or adding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered wide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity; however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG, respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various domains. We will release our code upon publication.

  People increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for moral advice, which may influence humans' decisions. Yet, little is known about how closely LLMs align with human moral judgments. To address this, we introduce the Moral Dilemma Dataset, a benchmark of 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with a distribution of human moral judgments consisting of a binary evaluation and a free-text rationale. We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional alignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across dilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high consensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In parallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions extracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral values than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch in both the distribution and diversity of values expressed. To close this gap, we introduce Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), a Dirichlet-based sampling method that conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles. DMP improves alignment by 64.3% and enhances value diversity, offering a step toward more pluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs.

  Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in understanding Structured Knowledge (SK) like KG and Table, existing evaluations for SK understanding are non-rigorous (i.e., lacking evaluations of specific capabilities) and focus on a single type of SK. Therefore, we aim to propose a more comprehensive and rigorous structured knowledge understanding benchmark to diagnose the shortcomings of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce SKA-Bench, a Structured Knowledge Augmented QA Benchmark that encompasses four widely used structured knowledge forms: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. We utilize a three-stage pipeline to construct SKA-Bench instances, which includes a question, an answer, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. To evaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we expand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness, Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical evaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1, indicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding structured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as the amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination phenomenon.

  Pairwise preferences over model responses are widely collected to evaluate and provide feedback to large language models (LLMs). Given two alternative model responses to the same input, a human or AI annotator selects the "better" response. This approach can provide feedback for domains where other hard-coded metrics are difficult to obtain (e.g., chat response quality), thereby helping model evaluation or training. However, for some domains high-quality pairwise comparisons can be tricky to obtain - from AI and humans. For example, for responses with many factual statements, annotators may disproportionately weigh writing quality rather than underlying facts. In this work, we explore augmenting standard AI annotator systems with additional tools to improve performance on three challenging response domains: long-form factual, math and code tasks. We propose a tool-using agentic system to provide higher quality feedback on these domains. Our system uses web-search and code execution to ground itself based on external validation, independent of the LLM's internal knowledge and biases. We provide extensive experimental results evaluating our method across the three targeted response domains as well as general annotation tasks, using RewardBench (incl. AlpacaEval and LLMBar), RewardMath, as well as three new datasets for domains with saturated pre-existing datasets. Our results indicate that external tools can indeed improve performance in many, but not all, cases. More generally, our experiments highlight the sensitivity of performance to simple parameters (e.g., prompt) and the need for improved (non-saturated) annotator benchmarks.

  Enabling farmers to access accurate agriculture-related information in their native languages in a timely manner is crucial for the success of the agriculture field. Although large language models (LLMs) can be used to implement Question Answering (QA) systems, simply using publicly available general-purpose LLMs in agriculture typically offer generic advisories, lacking precision in local and multilingual contexts due to insufficient domain-specific training and scarcity of high-quality, region-specific datasets. Our study addresses these limitations by generating multilingual synthetic agricultural datasets (English, Hindi, Punjabi) from agriculture-specific documents and fine-tuning language-specific LLMs. Our evaluation on curated multilingual datasets demonstrates significant improvements in factual accuracy, relevance, and agricultural consensus for the fine-tuned models compared to their baseline counterparts. These results highlight the efficacy of synthetic data-driven, language-specific fine-tuning as an effective strategy to improve the performance of LLMs in agriculture, especially in multilingual and low-resource settings. By enabling more accurate and localized agricultural advisory services, this study provides a meaningful step toward bridging the knowledge gap in AI-driven agricultural solutions for diverse linguistic communities.

  Attention mechanisms underpin the success of large language models (LLMs), yet their substantial computational and memory overhead poses challenges for optimizing efficiency and performance. A critical bottleneck arises as KV cache and attention computations scale rapidly with text length, challenging deployment on hardware with limited computational and memory resources. We observe that attention mechanisms exhibit substantial redundancy, since the KV cache can be significantly compressed and attention maps across heads display high similarity, revealing that much of the computation and storage is unnecessary. Leveraging these insights, we propose \textbf{G}rouped-Head Laten\textbf{T} \textbf{A}ttention (GTA), a novel attention mechanism that reduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining performance. GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism that reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache size; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that compresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs. GTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \emph{62.5\%} versus Grouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \emph{70\%}, all while avoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM deployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \emph{2x} increase in end-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational cost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint.

  Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is of great scientific and practical significance. Researchers typically employ process-supervised reward models (PRMs) to guide the reasoning process, effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However, existing methods for constructing process supervision training data, such as manual annotation and per-step Monte Carlo estimation, are often costly or suffer from poor quality. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a framework called EpicPRM, which annotates each intermediate reasoning step based on its quantified contribution and uses an adaptive binary search algorithm to enhance both annotation precision and efficiency. Using this approach, we efficiently construct a high-quality process supervision training dataset named Epic50k, consisting of 50k annotated intermediate steps. Compared to other publicly available datasets, the PRM trained on Epic50k demonstrates significantly superior performance. Getting Epic50k atthis https URL.

  Event Causality Identification (ECI) has emerged as a pivotal task in natural language processing (NLP), aimed at automatically detecting causal relationships between events in text. In this comprehensive survey, we systematically elucidate the foundational principles and technical frameworks of ECI, proposing a novel classification framework to categorize and clarify existing methods. {We discuss associated challenges, provide quantitative evaluations, and outline future directions for this dynamic and rapidly evolving field. We first delineate key definitions, problem formalization, and evaluation protocols of ECI. Our classification framework organizes ECI methods based on two primary tasks: Sentence-level Event Causality Identification (SECI) and Document-level Event Causality Identification (DECI). For SECI, we review methods including feature pattern-based matching, machine learning-based classification, deep semantic encoding, prompt-based fine-tuning, and causal knowledge pre-training, alongside common data augmentation strategies. For DECI, we focus on techniques such as deep semantic encoding, event graph reasoning, and prompt-based fine-tuning. We dedicate specific discussions to advancements in multi-lingual and cross-lingual ECI as well as zero-shot ECI leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, we analyze the strengths, limitations, and unresolved challenges of each method. Extensive quantitative evaluations are conducted on four benchmark datasets to assess various ECI methods. Finally, we explore future research directions.

  Stickers are increasingly used in social media to express sentiment and intent. Despite their significant impact on sentiment analysis and intent recognition, little research has been conducted in this area. To address this gap, we propose a new task: \textbf{M}ultimodal chat \textbf{S}entiment \textbf{A}nalysis and \textbf{I}ntent \textbf{R}ecognition involving \textbf{S}tickers (MSAIRS). Additionally, we introduce a novel multimodal dataset containing Chinese chat records and stickers excerpted from several mainstream social media platforms. Our dataset includes paired data with the same text but different stickers, the same sticker but different contexts, and various stickers consisting of the same images with different texts, allowing us to better understand the impact of stickers on chat sentiment and intent. We also propose an effective multimodal joint model, MMSAIR, featuring differential vector construction and cascaded attention mechanisms for enhanced multimodal fusion. Our experiments demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of jointly modeling sentiment and intent, as they mutually reinforce each other's recognition accuracy. MMSAIR significantly outperforms traditional models and advanced MLLMs, demonstrating the challenge and uniqueness of sticker interpretation in social media.

  Despite the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) for context-grounded tasks like summarization and question-answering, understanding what makes an LLM produce a certain response is challenging. We propose Multi-Level Explanations for Generative Language Models (MExGen), a technique to provide explanations for context-grounded text generation. MExGen assigns scores to parts of the context to quantify their influence on the model's output. It extends attribution methods like LIME and SHAP to LLMs used in context-grounded tasks where (1) inference cost is high, (2) input text is long, and (3) the output is text. We conduct a systematic evaluation, both automated and human, of perturbation-based attribution methods for summarization and question answering. The results show that our framework can provide more faithful explanations of generated output than available alternatives, including LLM self-explanations. We open-source code for MExGen as part of the ICX360 toolkit: https://github$.$com/IBM/ICX360.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently by decoupling total parameters from computational cost. However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge: predicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert activation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address this gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the computational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a large-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to systematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural configurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the expert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following predictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator with a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified scaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its configuration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained Ling-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active parameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an identical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance of the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources, thereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws. This work provides a principled and empirically-grounded foundation for the scaling of efficient MoE models.

  _Victor Hartman, Petter T√∂rnberg_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Negative campaigning is a central feature of political competition, yet empirical research has been limited by the high cost and limited scalability of existing classification methods. This study makes two key contributions. First, it introduces zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel approach for cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning. Using benchmark datasets in ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with native-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine learning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the largest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18 million tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017 and 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing parties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme and populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in significantly higher levels of negativity. These findings advance our understanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication in multiparty systems. More broadly, the study demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, transparent, and replicable research in political communication across linguistic and cultural contexts.

  Speech technology remains out of reach for most of the over 2300 languages in Africa. We present the first systematic assessment of large-scale synthetic voice corpora for African ASR. We apply a three-step process: LLM-driven text creation, TTS voice synthesis, and ASR fine-tuning. Eight out of ten languages for which we create synthetic text achieved readability scores above 5 out of 7. We evaluated ASR improvement for three (Hausa, Dholuo, Chichewa) and created more than 2,500 hours of synthetic voice data at below 1% of the cost of real data. Fine-tuned Wav2Vec-BERT-2.0 models trained on 250h real and 250h synthetic Hausa matched a 500h real-data-only baseline, while 579h real and 450h to 993h synthetic data created the best performance. We also present gender-disaggregated ASR performance evaluation. For very low-resource languages, gains varied: Chichewa WER improved about 6.5% relative with a 1:2 real-to-synthetic ratio; a 1:1 ratio for Dholuo showed similar improvements on some evaluation data, but not on others. Investigating intercoder reliability, ASR errors and evaluation datasets revealed the need for more robust reviewer protocols and more accurate evaluation data. All data and models are publicly released to invite further work to improve synthetic data for African languages.

  The booming development of AI agents presents unprecedented opportunities for automating complex tasks across various domains. However, their multi-step, multi-tool collaboration capabilities in the financial sector remain underexplored. This paper introduces FinGAIA, an end-to-end benchmark designed to evaluate the practical abilities of AI agents in the financial domain. FinGAIA comprises 407 meticulously crafted tasks, spanning seven major financial sub-domains: securities, funds, banking, insurance, futures, trusts, and asset management. These tasks are organized into three hierarchical levels of scenario depth: basic business analysis, asset decision support, and strategic risk management. We evaluated 10 mainstream AI agents in a zero-shot setting. The best-performing agent, ChatGPT, achieved an overall accuracy of 48.9\%, which, while superior to non-professionals, still lags financial experts by over 35 percentage points. Error analysis has revealed five recurring failure patterns: Cross-modal Alignment Deficiency, Financial Terminological Bias, Operational Process Awareness Barrier, among others. These patterns point to crucial directions for future research. Our work provides the first agent benchmark closely related to the financial domain, aiming to objectively assess and promote the development of agents in this crucial field.

  Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs) have emerged as a significant application direction for Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically rely on prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning to enable models to imitate character behaviors in specific scenarios, but often neglect the underlying \emph{cognitive} mechanisms driving these behaviors. Inspired by cognitive psychology, we introduce \textbf{CogDual}, a novel RPLA adopting a \textit{cognize-then-respond } reasoning paradigm. By jointly modeling external situational awareness and internal self-awareness, CogDual generates responses with improved character consistency and contextual alignment. To further optimize the performance, we employ reinforcement learning with two general-purpose reward schemes designed for open-domain text generation. Extensive experiments on the CoSER benchmark, as well as Cross-MR and LifeChoice, demonstrate that CogDual consistently outperforms existing baselines and generalizes effectively across diverse role-playing tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) can exhibit latent biases towards specific nationalities even when explicit demographic markers are not present. In this work, we introduce a novel name-based benchmarking approach derived from the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) dataset to investigate the impact of substituting explicit nationality labels with culturally indicative names, a scenario more reflective of real-world LLM applications. Our novel approach examines how this substitution affects both bias magnitude and accuracy across a spectrum of LLMs from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Our experiments show that small models are less accurate and exhibit more bias compared to their larger counterparts. For instance, on our name-based dataset and in the ambiguous context (where the correct choice is not revealed), Claude Haiku exhibited the worst stereotypical bias scores of 9%, compared to only 3.5% for its larger counterpart, Claude Sonnet, where the latter also outperformed it by 117.7% in accuracy. Additionally, we find that small models retain a larger portion of existing errors in these ambiguous contexts. For example, after substituting names for explicit nationality references, GPT-4o retains 68% of the error rate versus 76% for GPT-4o-mini, with similar findings for other model providers, in the ambiguous context. Our research highlights the stubborn resilience of biases in LLMs, underscoring their profound implications for the development and deployment of AI systems in diverse, global contexts.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conversational Information Retrieval (CIR) systems, while offering intuitive access to information, face a significant challenge: reliably handling unanswerable questions to prevent the generation of misleading or hallucinated content. Traditional approaches often rely on external classifiers, which can introduce inconsistencies with the core generative Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces Self-Aware LLM for Unanswerability (SALU), a novel approach that deeply integrates unanswerability detection directly within the LLM's generative process. SALU is trained using a multi-task learning framework for both standard Question Answering (QA) and explicit abstention generation for unanswerable queries. Crucially, it incorporates a confidence-score-guided reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase, which explicitly penalizes hallucinated responses and rewards appropriate abstentions, fostering intrinsic self-awareness of knowledge boundaries. Through extensive experiments on our custom-built C-IR_Answerability dataset, SALU consistently outperforms strong baselines, including hybrid LLM-classifier systems, in overall accuracy for correctly answering or abstaining from questions. Human evaluation further confirms SALU's superior reliability, achieving high scores in factuality, appropriate abstention, and, most importantly, a dramatic reduction in hallucination, demonstrating its ability to robustly "know when to say 'I don't know'."

  We evaluate the impact of large language model-based clinical decision support in live care. In partnership with Penda Health, a network of primary care clinics in Nairobi, Kenya, we studied AI Consult, a tool that serves as a safety net for clinicians by identifying potential documentation and clinical decision-making errors. AI Consult integrates into clinician workflows, activating only when needed and preserving clinician autonomy. We conducted a quality improvement study, comparing outcomes for 39,849 patient visits performed by clinicians with or without access to AI Consult across 15 clinics. Visits were rated by independent physicians to identify clinical errors. Clinicians with access to AI Consult made relatively fewer errors: 16% fewer diagnostic errors and 13% fewer treatment errors. In absolute terms, the introduction of AI Consult would avert diagnostic errors in 22,000 visits and treatment errors in 29,000 visits annually at Penda alone. In a survey of clinicians with AI Consult, all clinicians said that AI Consult improved the quality of care they delivered, with 75% saying the effect was "substantial". These results required a clinical workflow-aligned AI Consult implementation and active deployment to encourage clinician uptake. We hope this study demonstrates the potential for LLM-based clinical decision support tools to reduce errors in real-world settings and provides a practical framework for advancing responsible adoption.

  A broad range of NLP tasks involve selecting relevant text spans from given source texts. Despite this shared objective, such \textit{content selection} tasks have traditionally been studied in isolation, each with its own modeling approaches, datasets, and evaluation metrics. In this work, we propose \textit{instruction-guided content selection (IGCS)} as a beneficial unified framework for such settings, where the task definition and any instance-specific request are encapsulated as instructions to a language model. To promote this framework, we introduce \igcsbench{}, the first unified benchmark covering diverse content selection tasks. Further, we create a large generic synthetic dataset that can be leveraged for diverse content selection tasks, and show that transfer learning with these datasets often boosts performance, whether dedicated training for the targeted task is available or not. Finally, we address generic inference time issues that arise in LLM-based modeling of content selection, assess a generic evaluation metric, and overall propose the utility of our resources and methods for future content selection models.

  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled role-playing language agents to demonstrate significant potential in various applications. However, relying solely on prompts and contextual inputs often proves insufficient for achieving deep immersion in specific roles, particularly well-known fictional or public figures. On the other hand, fine-tuning-based approaches face limitations due to the challenges associated with data collection and the computational resources required for training, thereby restricting their broader applicability. To address these issues, we propose Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free role-playing framework through test-time scaling and context engineering. TTM uses LLM agents to automatically decouple a character's features into personality, memory, and linguistic style. Our framework involves a structured, three-stage generation pipeline that utilizes these features for controlled role-playing. It achieves high-fidelity role-playing performance, also enables seamless combinations across diverse linguistic styles and even variations in personality and memory. We evaluate our framework through human assessment, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves the outstanding performance in generating expressive and stylistically consistent character dialogues.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently output the label Unknown, yet current evaluations focus almost exclusively on whether such answers are honest rather than why they arise. This blurs two distinct cases: (i) an input that is genuinely indeterminate and (ii) a solvable problem that the model fails to resolve. We call this phenomenon Vague Perception. And thus we introduce a framework that quantifies the proportion of Unknown responses attributable to model incapacity and tests whether guided stimulation can convert them into either correct Known or correct Unknown with valid reasoning. By separating these sources of uncertainty, our method provides a clearer picture of LLM reasoning limits and their potential for improvement. As we get a theoretical accuracy of reasoning task on different LLMs, we apply different methods to test whether the model can reach the accuracy given a baseline framework. Our work is meaningful in exploring the potential reasoning ability of LLMs and providing a new perspective on solving the Vague Perception phenomenon.

  Arabic is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, yet efforts to develop and evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for Arabic remain relatively limited. Most existing Arabic benchmarks focus on linguistic, cultural, or religious content, leaving a significant gap in domains like STEM and code which are increasingly relevant for real-world LLM applications. To help bridge this gap, we present 3LM, a suite of three benchmarks designed specifically for Arabic. The first is a set of STEM-related question-answer pairs, naturally sourced from Arabic textbooks and educational worksheets. The second consists of synthetically generated STEM questions, created using the same sources. The third benchmark focuses on code generation, built through a careful translation of two widely used code benchmarks, incorporating a human-in-the-loop process with several rounds of review to ensure high-quality and faithful translations. We release all three benchmarks publicly to support the growth of Arabic LLM research in these essential but underrepresented areas.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively improves the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, retrieval noises significantly impact the quality of LLMs' generation, necessitating the development of denoising mechanisms. Previous methods extract evidence straightforwardly without explicit thinking, which risks filtering out key clues and struggles with generalization. To this end, we propose LEAR, which learns to extract rational evidence by (1) explicitly reasoning to identify potential cues within retrieval contents first, and then (2) consciously extracting to avoid omitting any key cues helpful for answering questions. Specifically, we frame evidence reasoning and evidence extraction into one unified response for end-to-end training; apply knowledge token masks for disentanglement to derive reasoning-based and extraction-based answers; and devise three types of verifiable reward functions, including answer, length, and format, to update the model via the policy optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of LEAR, providing compact and high-quality evidence, improving the accuracy of downstream tasks, and promoting effective application in online RAG systems.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multilingual capabilities, however, how to evaluate cross-lingual alignment remains underexplored. Existing alignment benchmarks primarily focus on sentence embeddings, but prior research has shown that neural models tend to induce a non-smooth representation space, which impact of semantic alignment evaluation on low-resource languages. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that similar information activates overlapping neuronal regions, we propose a novel Neuron State-Based Cross-Lingual Alignment (NeuronXA) to assess the cross-lingual a lignment capabilities of LLMs, which offers a more semantically grounded approach to assess cross-lingual alignment. We evaluate NeuronXA on several prominent multilingual LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, GLM, and OLMo) across two transfer tasks and three multilingual benchmarks. The results demonstrate that with only 100 parallel sentence pairs, NeuronXA achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.9556 with downstream tasks performance and 0.8514 with transferability. These findings demonstrate NeuronXA's effectiveness in assessing both cross-lingual alignment and transferability, even with a small dataset. This highlights its potential to advance cross-lingual alignment research and to improve the semantic understanding of multilingual LLMs.

  A prominent achievement of natural language processing (NLP) is its ability to understand and generate meaningful human language. This capability relies on complex feedforward transformer block architectures pre-trained on large language models (LLMs). However, LLM pre-training is currently feasible only for a few dominant companies due to the immense computational resources required, limiting broader research participation. This creates a critical need for more accessible alternatives. In this study, we explore whether tiny language models (TLMs) exhibit the same key qualitative features of LLMs. We demonstrate that TLMs exhibit a clear performance gap between pre-trained and non-pre-trained models across classification tasks, indicating the effectiveness of pre-training, even at a tiny scale. The performance gap increases with the size of the pre-training dataset and with greater overlap between tokens in the pre-training and classification datasets. Furthermore, the classification accuracy achieved by a pre-trained deep TLM architecture can be replicated through a soft committee of multiple, independently pre-trained shallow architectures, enabling low-latency TLMs without affecting classification accuracy. Our results are based on pre-training BERT-6 and variants of BERT-1 on subsets of the Wikipedia dataset and evaluating their performance on FewRel, AGNews, and DBPedia classification tasks. Future research on TLM is expected to further illuminate the mechanisms underlying NLP, especially given that its biologically inspired models suggest that TLMs may be sufficient for children or adolescents to develop language.

  Large language models have achieved remarkable progress across many languages. However, Tibetan, as a representative low-resource language, is particularly underrepresented in existing models due to the scarcity of high-quality training corpora. To address this gap, we curate the largest Tibetan pre-training corpus to date, aggregating data from diverse sources and applying a dedicated data cleaning and processing pipeline tailored for Tibetan. With the curated data, we continue pre/post-training a multilingual base model to enhance its generative capabilities in Tibetan. To evaluate the Tibetan capabilities of the model, we create new high-quality Tibetan benchmarks, and complement them with existing public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently and significantly outperforms both open-source models of similar scale and Tibetan-tailored models across a wide range of tasks.

  Argument Mining (AM), a critical subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP), focuses on extracting argumentative structures from text. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed AM, enabling advanced in-context learning, prompt-based generation, and robust cross-domain adaptability. This survey systematically synthesizes recent advancements in LLM-driven AM. We provide a concise review of foundational theories and annotation frameworks, alongside a meticulously curated catalog of datasets. A key contribution is our comprehensive taxonomy of AM subtasks, elucidating how contemporary LLM techniques -- such as prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and retrieval augmentation -- have reconfigured their execution. We further detail current LLM architectures and methodologies, critically assess evaluation practices, and delineate pivotal challenges including long-context reasoning, interpretability, and annotation bottlenecks. Conclusively, we highlight emerging trends and propose a forward-looking research agenda for LLM-based computational argumentation, aiming to strategically guide researchers in this rapidly evolving domain.

  In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants. Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque. Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque, which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g., Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly available.

  Recent advancements in adversarial jailbreak attacks have exposed critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling the circumvention of alignment safeguards through increasingly sophisticated prompt manipulations. Based on our experiments, we found that the effectiveness of jailbreak strategies is influenced by the comprehension ability of the attacked LLM. Building on this insight, we propose a capability-aware Multi-Encryption Framework (MEF) for evaluating vulnerabilities in black-box LLMs. Specifically, MEF first categorizes the comprehension ability level of the LLM, then applies different strategies accordingly: For models with limited comprehension ability, MEF adopts the Fu+En1 strategy, which integrates layered semantic mutations with an encryption technique, more effectively contributing to evasion of the LLM's defenses at the input and inference stages. For models with strong comprehension ability, MEF uses a more complex Fu+En1+En2 strategy, in which additional dual-ended encryption techniques are applied to the LLM's responses, further contributing to evasion of the LLM's defenses at the output stage. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving attack success rates of 98.9% on GPT-4o (29 May 2025 release) and 99.8% on GPT-4.1 (8 July 2025 release). Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the vulnerabilities in current LLM alignment mechanisms.

  Recent shifts in the space of large language model (LLM) research have shown an increasing focus on novel architectures to compete with prototypical Transformer-based models that have long dominated this space. Linear recurrent models have proven to be a viable competitor due to their computational efficiency. However, such models still demonstrate a sizable gap compared to Transformers in terms of in-context learning among other tasks that require recalling information from a context. In this work, we introduce Resona, a simple and scalable framework for augmenting linear recurrent models with retrieval. Resona augments models with the ability to integrate retrieved information from the provided input context, enabling tailored behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments on a variety of linear recurrent models demonstrate that Resona-augmented models observe significant performance gains on a variety of synthetic as well as real-world natural language tasks, highlighting its ability to act as a general purpose method to improve the in-context learning and language modeling abilities of linear recurrent LLMs.

  Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with first-order methods like back-propagation is computationally intensive. Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimisation uses function evaluations instead of gradients, reducing memory usage, but suffers from slow convergence in high-dimensional models. As a result, ZO research in LLMs has mostly focused on classification, overlooking more complex generative tasks. In this paper, we introduce ZOPrO, a novel ZO algorithm designed for Preference Optimisation in LLMs. We begin by analysing the interplay between policy and reward models during traditional (first-order) Preference Optimisation, uncovering patterns in their relative updates. Guided by these insights, we adapt Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) with a targeted sampling strategy to accelerate convergence. Through experiments on summarisation, machine translation, and conversational assistants, we demonstrate that our method consistently enhances reward signals while achieving convergence times comparable to first-order methods. While it falls short of some state-of-the-art methods, our work is the first to apply Zeroth-Order methods to Preference Optimisation in LLMs, going beyond classification tasks and paving the way for a largely unexplored research direction.

  Generative models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive datasets can lead them to memorize and inadvertently reveal sensitive information, raising ethical and privacy concerns. While some prior works have explored this issue in the context of LLMs, it presents a unique challenge for MLLMs due to the entangled nature of knowledge across modalities, making comprehensive unlearning more difficult. To address this challenge, we propose Modality Aware Neuron Unlearning (MANU), a novel unlearning framework for MLLMs designed to selectively clip neurons based on their relative importance to the targeted forget data, curated for different modalities. Specifically, MANU consists of two stages: important neuron selection and selective pruning. The first stage identifies and collects the most influential neurons across modalities relative to the targeted forget knowledge, while the second stage is dedicated to pruning those selected neurons. MANU effectively isolates and removes the neurons that contribute most to the forget data within each modality, while preserving the integrity of retained knowledge. Our experiments conducted across various MLLM architectures illustrate that MANU can achieve a more balanced and comprehensive unlearning in each modality without largely affecting the overall model utility.

  Previous approaches to persona simulation large language models (LLMs) have typically relied on learning basic biographical information, or using limited role-play dialogue datasets to capture a character's responses. However, a holistic representation of an individual goes beyond surface-level facts or conversations to deeper thoughts and thinking. In this work, we introduce CharacterBot, a model designed to replicate both the linguistic patterns and distinctive thought processes of a character. Using Lu Xun, a renowned Chinese writer, as a case study, we propose four training tasks derived from his 17 essay collections. These include a pre-training task focused on mastering external linguistic structures and knowledge, as well as three fine-tuning tasks: multiple-choice question answering, generative question answering, and style transfer, each aligning the LLM with Lu Xun's internal ideation and writing style. To optimize learning across these tasks, we introduce a CharLoRA parameter updating mechanism, where a general linguistic style expert collaborates with other task-specific experts to better study both the language style and the understanding of deeper thoughts. We evaluate CharacterBot on three tasks for linguistic accuracy and opinion comprehension, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms the baselines on our adapted metrics. We hope that this work inspires future research on deep character persona simulation LLM.

  Central to agentic capability and trustworthiness of language model agents (LMAs) is the extent they maintain stable, reliable, identity over time. However, LMAs inherit pathologies from large language models (LLMs) (statelessness, stochasticity, sensitivity to prompts and linguistically-intermediation) which can undermine their identifiability, continuity, persistence and consistency. This attrition of identity can erode their reliability, trustworthiness and utility by interfering with their agentic capabilities such as reasoning, planning and action. To address these challenges, we introduce \textit{agent identity evals} (AIE), a rigorous, statistically-driven, empirical framework for measuring the degree to which an LMA system exhibit and maintain their agentic identity over time, including their capabilities, properties and ability to recover from state perturbations. AIE comprises a set of novel metrics which can integrate with other measures of performance, capability and agentic robustness to assist in the design of optimal LMA infrastructure and scaffolding such as memory and tools. We set out formal definitions and methods that can be applied at each stage of the LMA life-cycle, and worked examples of how to apply them.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing research has predominantly concentrated on isolated reasoning domains such as mathematical problem-solving, coding tasks, or logical reasoning. However, real world reasoning scenarios inherently demand an integrated application of multiple cognitive skills. Despite this, the interplay among these reasoning skills under reinforcement learning remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic investigation of multi-domain reasoning within the RLVR framework, explicitly focusing on three primary domains: mathematical reasoning, code generation, and logical puzzle solving. We conduct a comprehensive study comprising four key components: (1) Leveraging the GRPO algorithm and the Qwen-2.5-7B model family, our study thoroughly evaluates the models' in-domain improvements and cross-domain generalization capabilities when trained on single-domain datasets. (2) Additionally, we examine the intricate interactions including mutual enhancements and conflicts that emerge during combined cross-domain training. (3) To further understand the influence of SFT on RL, we also analyze and compare performance differences between base and instruct models under identical RL configurations. (4) Furthermore, we delve into critical RL training details, systematically exploring the impacts of curriculum learning strategies, variations in reward design, and language-specific factors. Through extensive experiments, our results offer significant insights into the dynamics governing domain interactions, revealing key factors influencing both specialized and generalizable reasoning performance. These findings provide valuable guidance for optimizing RL methodologies to foster comprehensive, multi-domain reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) are facing the challenges of understanding and following multimodal assembly instructions, particularly when fine-grained spatial reasoning and precise object state detection are required. In this work, we explore LEGO Co-builder, a hybrid benchmark combining real-world LEGO assembly logic with programmatically generated multimodal scenes. The dataset captures stepwise visual states and procedural instructions, allowing controlled evaluation of instruction-following, object detection, and state detection. We introduce a unified framework and assess leading VLMs such as GPT-4o, Gemini, and Qwen-VL, under zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. Our results reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, with a maximum F1 score of just 40.54\% on state detection, highlighting gaps in fine-grained visual understanding. We release the benchmark, codebase, and generation pipeline to support future research on multimodal assembly assistants grounded in real-world workflows.

  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become a central focus in today's large language model (LLM) research, where models are designed to output a step-by-step thinking process before arriving at a final answer to handle complex reasoning tasks. Despite their promise, recent empirical studies (e.g., [Shojaee et al., 2025] from Apple) suggest that this thinking process may not actually enhance reasoning ability, where LLMs without explicit reasoning actually outperform LRMs on tasks with low or high complexity. In this work, we revisit these findings and investigate whether the limitations of LRMs persist when tool augmentations are introduced. We incorporate two types of tools, Python interpreters and scratchpads, and evaluate three representative LLMs and their LRM counterparts on Apple's benchmark reasoning puzzles. Our results show that, with proper tool use, LRMs consistently outperform their non-reasoning counterparts across all levels of task complexity. These findings challenge the recent narrative that reasoning is an illusion and highlight the potential of tool-augmented LRMs for solving complex problems.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in instruction following and general-purpose reasoning. However, achieving high-quality alignment with human intent and safety norms without human annotations remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we propose an Uncertainty-Driven Adaptive Self-Alignment (UDASA) framework designed to improve LLM alignment in a fully automated manner. UDASA first generates multiple responses for each input and quantifies output uncertainty across three dimensions: semantics, factuality, and value alignment. Based on these uncertainty scores, the framework constructs preference pairs and categorizes training samples into three stages, conservative, moderate, and exploratory, according to their uncertainty difference. The model is then optimized progressively across these stages. In addition, we conduct a series of preliminary studies to validate the core design assumptions and provide strong empirical motivation for the proposed framework. Experimental results show that UDASA outperforms existing alignment methods across multiple tasks, including harmlessness, helpfulness, truthfulness, and controlled sentiment generation, significantly improving model performance.

  This paper presents Compliance Brain Assistant (CBA), a conversational, agentic AI assistant designed to boost the efficiency of daily compliance tasks for personnel in enterprise environments. To strike a good balance between response quality and latency, we design a user query router that can intelligently choose between (i) FastTrack mode: to handle simple requests that only need additional relevant context retrieved from knowledge corpora; and (ii) FullAgentic mode: to handle complicated requests that need composite actions and tool invocations to proactively discover context across various compliance artifacts, and/or involving other APIs/models for accommodating requests. A typical example would be to start with a user query, use its description to find a specific entity and then use the entity's information to query other APIs for curating and enriching the final AI response.Our experimental evaluations compared CBA against an out-of-the-box LLM on various real-world privacy/compliance-related queries targeting various personas. We found that CBA substantially improved upon the vanilla LLM's performance on metrics such as average keyword match rate (83.7% vs. 41.7%) and LLM-judge pass rate (82.0% vs. 20.0%). We also compared metrics for the full routing-based design against the `fast-track only` and `full-agentic` modes and found that it had a better average match-rate and pass-rate while keeping the run-time approximately the same. This finding validated our hypothesis that the routing mechanism leads to a good trade-off between the two worlds.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Building on prior research on Generative AI (GenAI) and related tools for programming education, we developed SCRIPT, a chatbot based on ChatGPT-4o-mini, to support novice learners. SCRIPT allows for open-ended interactions and structured guidance through predefined prompts. We evaluated the tool via an experiment with 136 students from an introductory programming course at a large German university and analyzed how students interacted with SCRIPT while solving programming tasks with a focus on their feedback preferences. The results reveal that students' feedback requests seem to follow a specific sequence. Moreover, the chatbot responses aligned well with students' requested feedback types (in 75%), and it adhered to the system prompt constraints. These insights inform the design of GenAI-based learning support systems and highlight challenges in balancing guidance and flexibility in AI-assisted tools.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in reasoning tasks, yet their performance often falters on novel and complex problems. Domain-specific continued pretraining (CPT) methods, such as those tailored for mathematical reasoning, have shown promise but lack transferability to broader reasoning tasks. In this work, we pioneer the use of Graph Problem Reasoning (GPR) to enhance the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs. GPR tasks, spanning pathfinding, network analysis, numerical computation, and topological reasoning, require sophisticated logical and relational reasoning, making them ideal for teaching diverse reasoning patterns. To achieve this, we introduce GraphPile, the first large-scale corpus specifically designed for CPT using GPR data. Spanning 10.9 billion tokens across 23 graph tasks, the dataset includes chain-of-thought, program-of-thought, trace of execution, and real-world graph data. Using GraphPile, we train GraphMind on popular base models Llama 3 and 3.1, as well as Gemma 2, achieving up to 4.9 percent higher accuracy in mathematical reasoning and up to 21.2 percent improvement in non-mathematical reasoning tasks such as logical and commonsense reasoning. By being the first to harness GPR for enhancing reasoning patterns and introducing the first dataset of its kind, our work bridges the gap between domain-specific pretraining and universal reasoning capabilities, advancing the adaptability and robustness of LLMs.

  AI has become integral to safety-critical areas like autonomous driving systems (ADS) and robotics. The architecture of recent autonomous systems are trending toward end-to-end (E2E) monolithic architectures such as large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). In this paper, we review different architectural solutions and then evaluate the efficacy of common safety analyses such as failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA) and fault tree analysis (FTA). We show how these techniques can be improved for the intricate nature of the foundational models, particularly in how they form and utilize latent representations. We introduce HySAFE-AI, Hybrid Safety Architectural Analysis Framework for AI Systems, a hybrid framework that adapts traditional methods to evaluate the safety of AI systems. Lastly, we offer hints of future work and suggestions to guide the evolution of future AI safety standards.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning LLMs have demonstrated remarkable breakthroughs in solving complex problems that were previously out of reach. To ensure LLMs do not assist with harmful requests, safety alignment fine-tuning is necessary in the post-training phase. However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been shown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the "Safety Tax". In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets effectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning capabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a low-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our extensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding show that this approach produces highly safe LLMs -- with safety levels comparable to full-model fine-tuning -- without compromising their reasoning abilities. Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with smaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. We also explore methods that further reduce such overlap -- via regularization or during weight merging -- and observe some improvement on certain tasks. We hope this result motivates designing approaches that yield more consistent improvements in the reasoning-safety trade-off.

  Improving the reliability of large language models (LLMs) is critical for deploying them in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Deliberative Searcher}, the first framework to integrate certainty calibration with retrieval-based search for open-domain question answering. The agent performs multi-step reflection and verification over Wikipedia data and is trained with a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes for accuracy under a soft reliability constraint. Empirical results show that proposed method improves alignment between model confidence and correctness, leading to more trustworthy outputs. This paper will be continuously updated.

  The long-standing goal of creating a comprehensive, multi-purpose knowledge resource, reminiscent of the 1984 Cyc project, still persists in AI. Despite the success of knowledge resources like WordNet, ConceptNet, Wolfram|Alpha and other commercial knowledge graphs, verifiable, general-purpose widely available sources of knowledge remain a critical deficiency in AI infrastructure. Large language models struggle due to knowledge gaps; robotic planning lacks necessary world knowledge; and the detection of factually false information relies heavily on human expertise. What kind of knowledge resource is most needed in AI today? How can modern technology shape its development and evaluation? A recent AAAI workshop gathered over 50 researchers to explore these questions. This paper synthesizes our findings and outlines a community-driven vision for a new knowledge infrastructure. In addition to leveraging contemporary advances in knowledge representation and reasoning, one promising idea is to build an open engineering framework to exploit knowledge modules effectively within the context of practical applications. Such a framework should include sets of conventions and social structures that are adopted by contributors.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rise of artificial intelligence (A.I.) and large language models like ChatGPT, a new race for achieving artificial general intelligence (A.G.I) has started. While many speculate how and when A.I. will achieve A.G.I., there is no clear agreement on how A.G.I. can be detected in A.I. models, even when popular tools like the Turing test (and its modern variations) are used to measure their intelligence. In this work, we discuss why traditional methods like the Turing test do not suffice for measuring or detecting A.G.I. and provide a new, practical method that can be used to decide if a system (computer or any other) has reached or surpassed A.G.I. To achieve this, we make two new contributions. First, we present a clear definition for general intelligence (G.I.) and set a G.I. Threshold (G.I.T.) that can be used to distinguish between systems that achieve A.G.I. and systems that do not. Second, we present a new framework on how to construct tests that can detect if a system has achieved G.I. in a simple, comprehensive, and clear-cut fail/pass way. We call this novel framework the Turing test 2.0. We then demonstrate real-life examples of applying tests that follow our Turing test 2.0 framework on modern A.I. models.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks requiring precise, verifiable computation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is an increasingly critical step in post-training. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple, yet effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Synthetic preference data with its low cost and high quality enable effective alignment through single- or multi-model generated preference data. Our study reveals a striking, safety-specific phenomenon associated with DPO alignment: Although multi-model generated data enhances performance on general tasks (ARC, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, Winogrande) by providing diverse responses, it also tends to facilitate reward hacking during training. This can lead to a high attack success rate (ASR) when models encounter jailbreaking prompts. The issue is particularly pronounced when employing stronger models like GPT-4o or larger models in the same family to generate chosen responses paired with target model self-generated rejected responses, resulting in dramatically poorer safety outcomes. Furthermore, with respect to safety, using solely self-generated responses (single-model generation) for both chosen and rejected pairs significantly outperforms configurations that incorporate responses from stronger models, whether used directly as chosen data or as part of a multi-model response pool. We demonstrate that multi-model preference data exhibits high linear separability between chosen and rejected responses, which allows models to exploit superficial cues rather than internalizing robust safety constraints. Our experiments, conducted on models from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families, consistently validate these findings.
