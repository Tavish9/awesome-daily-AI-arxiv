  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding, reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making. Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid but practicallythis http URLaddress these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks, including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile planning capabilities. Project page:this https URL

- **[Towards Generalized Routing: Model and Agent Orchestration for Adaptive and Efficient Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07571)**  `arXiv:2509.07571`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI`

  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific AI agents has greatly expanded the ecosystem of AI-powered services. User queries, however, are highly diverse and often span multiple domains and task types, resulting in a complex and heterogeneous landscape. This diversity presents a fundamental routing challenge: how to accurately direct each query to an appropriate execution unit while optimizing both performance and efficiency. To address this, we propose MoMA (Mixture of Models and Agents), a generalized routing framework that integrates both LLM and agent-based routing. Built upon a deep understanding of model and agent capabilities, MoMA effectively handles diverse queries through precise intent recognition and adaptive routing strategies, achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and cost. Specifically, we construct a detailed training dataset to profile the capabilities of various LLMs under different routing model structures, identifying the most suitable tasks for each LLM. During inference, queries are dynamically routed to the LLM with the best cost-performance efficiency. We also introduce an efficient agent selection strategy based on a context-aware state machine and dynamic masking. Experimental results demonstrate that the MoMA router offers superior cost-efficiency and scalability compared to existing approaches.

- **[Continuous-Time Value Iteration for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09135)**  `arXiv:2509.09135`  `cs.LG` `cs.MA`  
  _Xuefeng Wang, Lei Zhang, Henglin Pu, Ahmed H. Qureshi, Husheng Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation. While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i) conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and (ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

- **[Harnessing Uncertainty: Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients for Long-Horizon LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09265)**  `arXiv:2509.09265`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Jiawei Wang, Jiacai Liu, Yuqian Fu, Yingru Li, Xintao Wang, Yuan Lin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors, and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly outperforms strong policy gradient baselines.

- **[LoRA-PAR: A Flexible Dual-System LoRA Partitioning Approach to Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20999)**  `arXiv:2507.20999`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Yining Huang, Bin Li, Keke Tang, Meilian Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefit substantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing their performance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameter fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost, most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.

- **[ButterflyQuant: Ultra-low-bit LLM Quantization through Learnable Orthogonal Butterfly Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09679)**  `arXiv:2509.09679`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Bingxin Xu, Zhen Dong, Oussama Elachqar, Yuzhang Shang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} = (\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$ entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning, butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.

- **[LLMs Don't Know Their Own Decision Boundaries: The Unreliability of Self-Generated Counterfactual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09396)**  `arXiv:2509.09396`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Harry Mayne, Ryan Othniel Kearns, Yushi Yang, Andrew M. Bean, Eoin Delaney, Chris Russell, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[MetaLLMix : An XAI Aided LLM-Meta-learning Based Approach for Hyper-parameters Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09387)**  `arXiv:2509.09387`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Mohammed Tiouti, Mohamed Bal-Ghaoui_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot hyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI, and efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8 tasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times on 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of best-performing baselines.

- **[Demo: Healthcare Agent Orchestrator (HAO) for Patient Summarization in Molecular Tumor Boards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06602)**  `arXiv:2509.06602`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Matthias Blondeel, Noel Codella, Sam Preston, Hao Qiu, Leonardo Schettini, Frank Tuan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) are multidisciplinary forums where oncology specialists collaboratively assess complex patient cases to determine optimal treatment strategies. A central element of this process is the patient summary, typically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon, or their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records into a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is often labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical information. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent Orchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that coordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and comprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient summaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic variation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate the measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these evaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework designed to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated summaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board discussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results show that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including partial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict entailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free evaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing sensitive clinical data. Together, HAO and TBFact establish a robust foundation for delivering reliable and scalable support to MTBs.

- **[Group Expectation Policy Optimization for Heterogeneous Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17850)**  `arXiv:2508.17850`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Han Zhang, Ruibin Zheng, Zexuan Yi, Zhuo Zhang, Hanyang Peng, Hui Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized training is becoming essential. Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) but faces challenges in heterogeneous distributed environments due to its tightly-coupled sampling-learning alternation. We propose HeteroRL, an asynchronous RL architecture that decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, enabling robust deployment across geographically distributed nodes under network delays. We identify that latency-induced KL divergence causes importance sampling failure due to high variance. To address this, we propose Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO), which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling mechanism. Theoretically, GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction. Experiments show it maintains superior stability over methods like GRPO, with less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays, demonstrating strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks.

- **[Clip Your Sequences Fairly: Enforcing Length Fairness for Sequence-Level RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09177)**  `arXiv:2509.09177`  `cs.LG`  
  _Hanyi Mao, Quanjia Xiao, Lei Pang, Haixiao Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets.

  _Hao Zhang, Bo Huang, Zhenjia Li, Xi Xiao, Hui Yi Leong, Zumeng Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed both everyday life and scientific research. However, adapting LLMs from general-purpose models to specialized tasks remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent method within Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), has emerged as a promising approach to LLMs by approximating model weight updates using low-rank decomposition. However, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each incremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing this issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose Sensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates ranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities. It leverages the second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to effectively capture weight sensitivity, enabling optimal rank allocation with minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results have demonstrated robust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across diverse tasks and benchmarks.

- **[Two Sides of the Same Optimization Coin: Model Degradation and Representation Collapse in Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08401)**  `arXiv:2509.08401`  `cs.LG`  
  _Xunkai Li, Daohan Su, Sicheng Liu, Ru Zhang, Zhenjun Li, Bing Zhou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs; Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) - (1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale. Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot scenarios.

  Molecular design plays a critical role in advancing fields such as drug discovery, materials science, and chemical engineering. This work introduces the Multi-Objective Large Language Model for Molecular Design (MOLLM), a novel framework that combines domain-specific knowledge with the adaptability of large language models to optimize molecular properties across multiple objectives. Leveraging in-context learning and multi-objective optimization, MOLLM achieves superior performance and innovation, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We significantly improve the efficiency of our framework, making it 14 times faster and substantially more cost-effective without compromising performance compared to the latest similar work. Our results demonstrate that MOLLM consistently outperforms SOTA models across experiments and excels on the PMO benchmark. In addition, we provide extensive ablation studies and analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of each component and the quality of the output molecules.

- **[Investigating Energy Efficiency and Performance Trade-offs in LLM Inference Across Tasks and DVFS Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08219)**  `arXiv:2501.08219`  `cs.LG`  
  _Paul Joe Maliakel, Shashikant Ilager, Ivona Brandic_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, leading to widespread adoption in both research and industry. However, their inference workloads are computationally and energy intensive, raising concerns about sustainability and environmental impact. As LLMs continue to scale, it becomes essential to identify and optimize the factors that influence their runtime efficiency without compromising performance. In this work, we systematically investigate the energy-performance trade-offs of LLMs during inference. We benchmark models of varying sizes and architectures, including Falcon-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, LLaMA-3.2-1B, LLaMA-3.2-3B, and GPT-Neo-2.7B, across tasks such as question answering, commonsense reasoning, and factual generation. We analyze the effect of input characteristics, such as sequence length, entropy, named entity density and so on. Furthermore, we examine the impact of hardware-level optimizations through Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), measuring how different GPU clock settings affect latency and power consumption. Our empirical findings show that model architecture, input complexity, and clock configuration significantly influence inference efficiency. By correlating input features with energy metrics and evaluating DVFS behavior, we identify practical strategies that reduce energy consumption by up to 30% while preserving model quality. This study provides actionable insights for designing energy-efficient and sustainable LLM inference systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into every aspect of our work and daily lives, there are growing concerns about user privacy, which push the trend toward local deployment of these models. There are a number of lightweight LLMs (e.g., Gemini Nano, LLAMA2 7B) that can run locally on smartphones, providing users with greater control over their personal data. As a rapidly emerging application, we are concerned about their performance on commercial-off-the-shelf mobile devices. To fully understand the current landscape of LLM deployment on mobile platforms, we conduct a comprehensive measurement study on mobile devices. We evaluate both metrics that affect user experience, including token throughput, latency, and battery consumption, as well as factors critical to developers, such as resource utilization, DVFS strategies, and inference engines. In addition, we provide a detailed analysis of how these hardware capabilities and system dynamics affect on-device LLM performance, which may help developers identify and address bottlenecks for mobile LLM applications. We also provide comprehensive comparisons across the mobile system-on-chips (SoCs) from major vendors, highlighting their performance differences in handling LLM workloads. We hope that this study can provide insights for both the development of on-device LLMs and the design for future mobile system architecture.

- **[COCO-Urdu: A Large-Scale Urdu Image-Caption Dataset with Multimodal Quality Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09014)**  `arXiv:2509.09014`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Umair Hassan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale, high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000 images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency; low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language systems.

- **[Improving Alignment in LVLMs with Debiased Self-Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20655)**  `arXiv:2508.20655`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Sihan Yang, Chenhang Cui, Zihao Zhao, Yiyang Zhou, Weilong Yan, Ying Wei, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets, human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

  Multilingual OCR and information extraction from receipts remains challenging, particularly for complex scripts like Arabic. We introduce \dataset, a comprehensive dataset designed for Arabic-English receipt understanding comprising 20,000 annotated receipts from diverse retail settings, 30,000 OCR-annotated images, and 10,000 item-level annotations, and a new Receipt QA subset with 1265 receipt images paired with 40 question-answer pairs each to support LLM evaluation for receipt understanding. The dataset captures merchant names, item descriptions, prices, receipt numbers, and dates to support object detection, OCR, and information extraction tasks. We establish baseline performance using traditional methods (Tesseract OCR) and advanced neural networks, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness for processing complex, noisy real-world receipt layouts. Our publicly accessible dataset advances automated multilingual document processing research (seethis https URL).

  _Tung Vu, Lam Nguyen, Quynh Dao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning. VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories, ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting, Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation, and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory, and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets, establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

  _Garry Yang, Zizhe Chen, Man Hon Wong, Haoyu Lei, Yongqiang Chen, Zhenguo Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions. Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects in longer videos.

  As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for strongerthis http URLis publicly available atthis https URL.

  Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above" option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection, HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings.

  Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues, without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid, fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar synthesis.

  Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order. However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy. Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t. absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some benchmarks.

  Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images, and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score. Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

  Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated content. Med3DInsight introduces a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks, potentially enhancing their performance.

  In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon (Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models, finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American people in media professions.

  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models (LLMs) routes each token through a subset of specialized Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), known as experts. We present SteerMoE, a framework for steering MoE models by detecting and controlling behavior-linked experts. Our detection method identifies experts with distinct activation patterns across paired inputs exhibiting contrasting behaviors. By selectively (de)activating such experts during inference, we control behaviors like faithfulness and safety without retraining or modifying weights. Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs, our steering raises safety by up to +20% and faithfulness by +27%. In adversarial attack mode, it drops safety by -41% alone, and -100% when combined with existing jailbreak methods, bypassing all safety guardrails and exposing a new dimension of alignment faking hidden within experts.

  This system paper presents the DeMeVa team's approaches to the third edition of the Learning with Disagreements shared task (LeWiDi 2025; Leonardelli et al., 2025). We explore two directions: in-context learning (ICL) with large language models, where we compare example sampling strategies; and label distribution learning (LDL) methods with RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), where we evaluate several fine-tuning methods. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we show that ICL can effectively predict annotator-specific annotations (perspectivist annotations), and that aggregating these predictions into soft labels yields competitive performance; and (2) we argue that LDL methods are promising for soft label predictions and merit further exploration by the perspectivist community.

  In-Context Learning (ICL) is an intriguing ability of large language models (LLMs). Despite a substantial amount of work on its behavioral aspects and how it emerges in miniature setups, it remains unclear which mechanism assembles task information from the individual examples in a fewshot prompt. We use causal interventions to identify information flow in Gemma-2 2B for five naturalistic ICL tasks. We find that the model infers task information using a two-step strategy we call contextualize-then-aggregate: In the lower layers, the model builds up representations of individual fewshot examples, which are contextualized by preceding examples through connections between fewshot input and output tokens across the sequence. In the higher layers, these representations are aggregated to identify the task and prepare prediction of the next output. The importance of the contextualization step differs between tasks, and it may become more important in the presence of ambiguous examples. Overall, by providing rigorous causal analysis, our results shed light on the mechanisms through which ICL happens in language models.

  We introduce and evaluate Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued Engagement (SPICE), a simple diagnostic signal elicited by asking a Large Language Model a YES or NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a user's behavior after reviewing a short transcript. In a study using a 3-tone (friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four open-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480 trials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone. Friendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5% YES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue (17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This core association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical tests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse classification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still overwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the time). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a preamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under ambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text rather than a multi-turn chat. The results validate SPICE as a robust, low-overhead, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions, complementing existing metrics by offering a direct, relational signal of a model's state. All stimuli, code, and analysis scripts are released to support replication.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet current RLVR methods often explore poorly, leading to premature convergence and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven Exploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense of curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates from a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus within the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL. Empirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a calibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM failure modes.

  This research investigates the effectiveness of alignment techniques, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a combined SFT+DPO approach on improving the safety and helpfulness of the OPT-350M language model. Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset, we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model, and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited GPU resources, and training constraints. This study offers a comprehensive view of how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment and provides a foundation for more robust alignment pipelines in future work.

  Intent, typically clearly formulated and planned, functions as a cognitive framework for communication and problem-solving. This paper introduces the concept of Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the explicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and provides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and action. By emulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is hypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of LLMs. Extensive experiments on text summarization, multi-task question answering, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of Speaking with Intent over direct generation without explicit intent. Further analysis corroborates the generalizability of SWI under different experimental settings. Moreover, human evaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the intent produced by SWI. The promising results in enhancing LLMs with explicit intents pave a new avenue for boosting LLMs' generation and reasoning abilities with cognitive notions.

  The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language understanding has made them increasingly popular in mental health research. While many studies explore LLMs' capabilities in emotion recognition, a critical gap remains in evaluating whether LLMs align with human emotions at a fine-grained level. Existing research typically focuses on classifying emotions into predefined, limited categories, overlooking more nuanced expressions. To address this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit communities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our comprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories, enabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under various prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align with human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis further shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with established emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture contextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer insights for future research aimed at enhancing their contextual understanding.

  This study explores the use of generative AI for automating the classification of tutors' Dialogue Acts (DAs), aiming to reduce the time and effort required by traditional manual coding. This case study uses the open-source CIMA corpus, in which tutors' responses are pre-annotated into four DA categories. Both GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models were tested using tailored prompts. Results show that GPT-4 achieved 80% accuracy, a weighted F1-score of 0.81, and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.74, surpassing baseline performance and indicating substantial agreement with human annotations. These findings suggest that generative AI has strong potential to provide an efficient and accessible approach to DA classification, with meaningful implications for educational dialogue analysis. The study also highlights the importance of task-specific label definitions and contextual information in enhancing the quality of automated annotation. Finally, it underscores the ethical considerations associated with the use of generative AI and the need for responsible and transparent research practices.

  Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong general-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many in-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to leverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without gradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning for broader chat workflows.Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8), MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it attains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat capabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves 75.4% on MMLU.

  Large Language Models require both contextual knowledge and parametric memory, but these sources can disagree. Prior investigations on contextual question answering tasks report a preference toward parametric knowledge under conflict, yet they focus almost exclusively on tasks that should always rely on the given passage, leaving open how this behavior manifests when tasks demand different amounts and kinds of knowledge. We study this question with a model-agnostic diagnostic framework that (i) automatically detects disagreements between a model's beliefs and a curated knowledge set, and (ii) injects controlled conflicts into tasks. The resulting datasets span two orthogonal dimensions: task knowledge reliance and conflict plausibility. Evaluating representative open-source LLMs, we find that: (1) performance degradation from conflict correlates with a task's knowledge reliance; (2) explanatory rationales and simple reiteration both increase context reliance-helpful for context-only tasks but harmful when parametric knowledge should dominate; (3) These behaviors raise concerns about the validity of model-based evaluation and underscore the need to account for knowledge conflict in the deployment of LLMs.

  Test-time compute methods like beam search can significantly improve the reasoning capabilities and problem-solving accuracy of large language models. However, these approaches require substantially increased computational resources, with most computation wasted on exploring low-diversity branches where the model already exhibits high confidence. We observe that a small subset of uncertain reasoning steps has a disproportionately large impact on final prediction accuracy, and branching at these points tends to yield higher-quality and more diverse candidate reasoning steps. Therefore, we introduce Entropy-Gated Branching: a novel inference technique that dynamically allocates computational resources by selectively expanding prediction sequences only at points of high uncertainty. Our method leverages entropy as a gating mechanism to identify when branching is most beneficial, coupled with an external feedback model to rank and prune candidate branches. Empirical results on mathematical and financial reasoning benchmarks show that this strategy improves accuracy by 22.6% over standard inference while operating 37% faster than conventional beam search with similar or higher performance. Our results show that dynamic resource allocation during inference can substantially improve both efficiency and effectiveness, offering a more scalable pathway to enhanced LLM reasoning capabilities.

  Mental health issues are worsening in today's competitive society, such as depression and anxiety. Traditional healings like counseling and chatbots fail to engage effectively, they often provide generic responses lacking emotional depth. Although large language models (LLMs) have the potential to create more human-like interactions, they still struggle to capture subtle emotions. This requires LLMs to be equipped with human-like adaptability and warmth. To fill this gap, we propose the MIND (Multi-agent INner Dialogue), a novel paradigm that provides more immersive psychological healing environments. Considering the strong generative and role-playing ability of LLM agents, we predefine an interactive healing framework and assign LLM agents different roles within the framework to engage in interactive inner dialogues with users, thereby providing an immersive healing experience. We conduct extensive human experiments in various real-world healing dimensions, and find that MIND provides a more user-friendly experience than traditional paradigms. This demonstrates that MIND effectively leverages the significant potential of LLMs in psychological healing.

  Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) offers a promising approach to aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Typically, a reward model is trained or supplied to act as a proxy for humans in evaluating generated responses during the reinforcement training phase. However, current reward models operate as sequence-to-one models, allocating a single, sparse, and delayed reward to an entire output sequence. This approach may overlook the significant contributions of individual tokens toward the desired outcome. To this end, we propose a more fine-grained, token-level guidance approach for RL training. Specifically, we introduce RED, a novel reward redistribition method that evaluates and assigns specific credit to each token using an off-the-shelf reward model. Utilizing these fine-grained rewards enhances the model's understanding of language nuances, leading to more precise performance improvements. Notably, our method does not require modifying the reward model or introducing additional training steps, thereby incurring minimal computational costs. Experimental results across diverse datasets and tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

In theory, the combination of causal self-attention and multilayer perceptron layers allows every token to access and compute information based on all preceding tokens. In practice, to what extent are such operations present? In this paper, on mental math tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without explicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting input-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes of information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and forcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers. With two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and Attention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with high accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful computation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last token, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle layers. Experiments on a variety of models and arithmetic expressions show that this subgraph is sufficient and necessary for high model performance, transfers across different models, and works on a variety of input styles. Ablations on different CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other methods, which may be of independent interest.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the construction of multi-agent systems to solve complex tasks by dividing responsibilities among specialized agents, such as a planning agent for subgoal generation and a grounding agent for executing tool-use actions. Most existing methods typically fine-tune these agents independently, leading to capability gaps among them with poor coordination. To address this, we propose MOAT, a Multi-Agent Joint Alignment Tuning framework that improves agents collaboration through iterative alignment. MOAT alternates between two key stages: (1) Planning Agent Alignment, which optimizes the planning agent to generate subgoal sequences that better guide the grounding agent; and (2) Grounding Agent Improving, which fine-tunes the grounding agent using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by the agent itself to enhance its generalization capablity. Theoretical analysis proves that MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training process. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that MOAT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 3.1% on held-in tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly reshaped financial NLP, enabling new tasks and driving a proliferation of datasets and diversification of data sources. Yet, this transformation has outpaced traditional surveys. In this paper, we present MetaGraph, a generalizable methodology for extracting knowledge graphs from scientific literature and analyzing them to obtain a structured, queryable view of research trends. We define an ontology for financial NLP research and apply an LLM-based extraction pipeline to 681 papers (2022-2025), enabling large-scale, data-driven analysis. MetaGraph reveals three key phases: early LLM adoption and task/dataset innovation; critical reflection on LLM limitations; and growing integration of peripheral techniques into modular systems. This structured view offers both practitioners and researchers a clear understanding of how financial NLP has evolved - highlighting emerging trends, shifting priorities, and methodological shifts-while also demonstrating a reusable approach for mapping scientific progress in other domains.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Assessing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by confidence elicitation is a prominent approach to AI safety in high-stakes applications, such as healthcare and finance. Existing methods either require expensive computational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical and unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a Generative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and reliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in which the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden state and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in real-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with calibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and two benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks, outperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or an auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time scaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that using GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also significantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling scheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e., confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches, such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time, unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g., pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility), allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.

  _Grazia Sveva Ascione, Nicol√≤ Tamagnone_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Classifying patents by their relevance to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is crucial for tracking how innovation addresses global challenges. However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of supervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer learning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability. This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem, using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL citations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we develop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models (LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and applications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology. Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based retrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that aligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG associations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping patents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression models. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1) internal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method outperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot LLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation, co-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic, cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological classifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic alignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.

  Question Answering over Tabular Data (Table QA) presents unique challenges due to the diverse structure, size, and data types of real-world tables. The SemEval 2025 Task 8 (DataBench) introduced a benchmark composed of large-scale, domain-diverse datasets to evaluate the ability of models to accurately answer structured queries. We propose a Natural Language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek v2:16b to generate SQL queries dynamically. Our system follows a multi-stage pipeline involving example selection, SQL query generation, answer extraction, verification, and iterative refinement. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving 70.5\% accuracy on DataBench QA and 71.6\% on DataBench Lite QA, significantly surpassing baseline scores of 26\% and 27\% respectively. This paper details our methodology, experimental results, and alternative approaches, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of LLM-driven Table QA.

  Accurately assessing candidate seniority from resumes is a critical yet challenging task, complicated by the prevalence of overstated experience and ambiguous self-presentation. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including fine-tuned BERT architectures, for automating seniority classification in resumes. To rigorously evaluate model performance, we introduce a hybrid dataset comprising both real-world resumes and synthetically generated hard examples designed to simulate exaggerated qualifications and understated seniority. Using the dataset, we evaluate the performance of Large Language Models in detecting subtle linguistic cues associated with seniority inflation and implicit expertise. Our findings highlight promising directions for enhancing AI-driven candidate evaluation systems and mitigating bias introduced by self-promotional language.

  Marmoset monkeys exhibit complex vocal communication, challenging the view that nonhuman primates vocal communication is entirely innate, and show similar features of human speech, such as vocal labeling of others and turn-taking. Studying their vocal communication offers a unique opportunity to link it with brain activity-especially given the difficulty of accessing the human brain in speech and language research. Since Marmosets communicate primarily through vocalizations, applying standard LLM approaches is not straightforward. We introduce Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM), an optimized spoken language model pipeline for Marmoset vocal communication. We designed a novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data, alongside weakly labeled conversational data, to assess GmSLM and demonstrate its advantage over a basic human-speech-based baseline. GmSLM generated vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically and performed well on downstream tasks. Despite being fully unsupervised, GmSLM effectively distinguish real from artificial conversations and may support further investigations of the neural basis of vocal communication and provides a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity. We believe GmSLM stands to benefit future work in neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary biology. Samples are provided under:this http URL.

  _Sophia Maria_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) excel in general-domain applications, yet their performance often degrades in specialized tasks requiring domain-specific knowledge. E-commerce is particularly challenging, as its data are noisy, heterogeneous, multilingual, and highly dynamic. We present Compass-v3, a vertical-domain Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 245B total parameters and 71B active per token, designed for Southeast Asian e-commerce. Compass-v3 adopts fewer but larger experts, combined with hardware-efficient optimizations-such as intra-node expert parallelism and a customized memcpy operator-to maximize GPU utilization. The model is trained on 12T tokens of curated multilingual corpora and large-scale synthetic e-commerce instructions using a mixed-training strategy. To enhance alignment, we propose Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO), which captures token-level distinctions and improves instruction adherence in commerce-specific scenarios. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compass-v3 delivers state-of-the-art e-commerce performance, surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1, GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B. Moreover, Compass-v3 demonstrates strong multilingual capability across low-resource Southeast Asian languages (Indonesian, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Malay, Taglog) and Portuguese while sustaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. It has already been widely applied in Shopee's industrial-scale e-commerce platform and is gradually replacing OpenAI's traffic, now accounting for over 70\% of total LLM usage, highlighting its dual strengths in specialized commerce expertise and broad linguistic competence.

  Despite being the 5th most spoken language, Bangla remains underrepresented in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for code generation. This primarily stems from the scarcity of high-quality data to pre-train and/or finetune such models. Hence, we introduce the first dedicated family of Code LLMs for Bangla (1B & 9B). We offer three major contributions: (1) a comprehensive Bangla code instruction datasets for programming domain adaptation; (2) MBPP-Bangla, an evaluation benchmark for Bangla code generation; and (3) the TigerCoder-family of Code LLMs, achieving significant ~11-18% performance gains at Pass@1 over existing multilingual and general-purpose Bangla LLMs. Our findings show that curated, high-quality datasets can overcome limitations of smaller models for low-resource languages. We open-source all resources to advance further Bangla LLM research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across diverse research domains. However, their performance in universal information extraction (UIE) remains insufficient, especially when tackling structured output scenarios that involve complex schema descriptions and require multi-step reasoning. While existing approaches enhance the performance of LLMs through in-context learning and instruction tuning, significant limitations nonetheless persist. To enhance the model's generalization ability, we propose integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with multi-perspective reasoning for information extraction (IE) tasks. Our work transitions LLMs from passive extractors to active reasoners, enabling them to understand not only what to extract but also how to reason. Experiments conducted on multiple IE benchmarks demonstrate that MR-UIE consistently elevates extraction accuracy across domains and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on several datasets. Furthermore, incorporating multi-perspective reasoning into RL notably enhances generalization in complex IE tasks, underscoring the critical role of reasoning in challenging scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant performance variations depending on the linguistic and cultural context in which they are applied. This disparity signals the necessity of mature evaluation frameworks that can assess their capabilities in specific regional settings. In the case of Portuguese, existing evaluations remain limited, often relying on translated datasets that may not fully capture linguistic nuances or cultural references. Meanwhile, native Portuguese-language datasets predominantly focus on structured national exams or sentiment analysis of social media interactions, leaving gaps in evaluating broader linguistic understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce BRoverbs, a dataset specifically designed to assess LLM performance through Brazilian proverbs. Proverbs serve as a rich linguistic resource, encapsulating cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex syntactic structures that challenge the model comprehension of regional expressions. BRoverbs aims to provide a new evaluation tool for Portuguese-language LLMs, contributing to advancing regionally informed benchmarking. The benchmark is available atthis https URL.

  RAG and fine-tuning are prevalent strategies for improving the quality of LLM outputs. However, in constrained situations, such as that of the 2025 LM-KBC challenge, such techniques are restricted. In this work we investigate three facets of the triple completion task: generation, quality assurance, and LLM response parsing. Our work finds that in this constrained setting: additional information improves generation quality, LLMs can be effective at filtering poor quality triples, and the tradeoff between flexibility and consistency with LLM response parsing is setting dependent.

  Large language models excel in English but still struggle with complex reasoning in many low-resource languages (LRLs). Existing encoder-plus-decoder methods such as LangBridge and MindMerger raise accuracy on mid and high-resource languages, yet they leave a large gap on LRLs. We present MERLIN, a two-stage model-stacking framework that applies a curriculum learning strategy -- from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data -- and adapts only a small set of DoRA weights. On the AfriMGSM benchmark MERLIN improves exact-match accuracy by +12.9 pp over MindMerger and outperforms GPT-4o-mini. It also yields consistent gains on MGSM and MSVAMP (+0.9 and +2.8 pp), demonstrating effectiveness across both low and high-resource settings.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek, demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that PersonaFuse offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement toward more human-centric AI systems.

  Extensive research has been conducted to explore the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in table reasoning. However, the essential task of transforming tables information into reports remains a significant challenge for industrial applications. This task is plagued by two critical issues: 1) the complexity and diversity of tables lead to suboptimal reasoning outcomes; and 2) existing table benchmarks lack the capacity to adequately assess the practical application of this task. To fill this gap, we propose the table-to-report task and construct a bilingual benchmark named T2R-bench, where the key information flow from the tables to the reports for this task. The benchmark comprises 457 industrial tables, all derived from real-world scenarios and encompassing 19 industry domains as well as 4 types of industrial tables. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation criteria to fairly measure the quality of report generation. The experiments on 25 widely-used LLMs reveal that even state-of-the-art models like Deepseek-R1 only achieves performance with 62.71 overall score, indicating that LLMs still have room for improvement on T2R-bench.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reducing the key-value (KV) cache burden in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerates inference. Dynamically selecting critical KV caches during decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear hashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to the orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in LLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear hashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys, enhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight, stable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling optimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8 hours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves retrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least 5$\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the computational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA kernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\mu$s on a single A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\times$ higher than vanilla decoding.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-context learning (ICL) allows a language model to improve its problem-solving capability when provided with suitable information in context. Since the choice of in-context information can be determined based on the problem itself, in-context learning is analogous to human learning from teachers in a classroom. Recent works (Didolkar et al., 2024a; 2024b) show that ICL performance can be improved by leveraging a frontier large language model's (LLM) ability to predict required skills to solve a problem, popularly referred to as an LLM's metacognition, and using the recommended skills to construct necessary in-context examples. While this skill-based strategy boosts ICL performance in larger models, its gains on small language models (SLMs) have been minimal, highlighting a performance gap in ICL capabilities. We investigate this gap and show that skill-based prompting can hurt SLM performance on easy questions by introducing unnecessary information, akin to cognitive overload. To address this, we introduce AdaptMI, an adaptive approach to selecting skill-based in-context Math Instructions for SLMs. Inspired by cognitive load theory from human pedagogy, our method only introduces skill-based examples when the model performs poorly. We further propose AdaptMI+, which adds examples targeted to the specific skills missing from the model's responses. On 5-shot evaluations across popular math benchmarks and five SLMs (1B--7B; Qwen, Llama), AdaptMI+ improves accuracy by up to 6% over naive skill-based strategies.

  Culturally grounded commonsense reasoning is underexplored in low-resource languages due to scarce data and costly native annotation. We test whether large language models (LLMs) can generate culturally nuanced narratives for such settings. Focusing on Javanese and Sundanese, we compare three data creation strategies: (1) LLM-assisted stories prompted with cultural cues, (2) machine translation from Indonesian benchmarks, and (3) native-written stories. Human evaluation finds LLM stories match natives on cultural fidelity but lag in coherence and correctness. We fine-tune models on each dataset and evaluate on a human-authored test set for classification and generation. LLM-generated data yields higher downstream performance than machine-translated and Indonesian human-authored training data. We release a high-quality benchmark of culturally grounded commonsense stories in Javanese and Sundanese to support future work.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Users often assume that large language models (LLMs) share their cognitive alignment of context and intent, leading them to omit critical information in question-answering (QA) and produce ambiguous queries. Responses based on misaligned assumptions may be perceived as hallucinations. Therefore, identifying possible implicit assumptions is crucial in QA. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose Conditional Ambiguous Question-Answering (CondAmbigQA), a benchmark comprising 2,000 ambiguous queries and condition-aware evaluation metrics. Our study pioneers "conditions" as explicit contextual constraints that resolve ambiguities in QA tasks through retrieval-based annotation, where retrieved Wikipedia fragments help identify possible interpretations for a given query and annotate answers accordingly. Experiments demonstrate that models considering conditions before answering improve answer accuracy by 11.75%, with an additional 7.15% gain when conditions are explicitly provided. These results highlight that apparent hallucinations may stem from inherent query ambiguity rather than model failure, and demonstrate the effectiveness of condition reasoning in QA, providing researchers with tools for rigorous evaluation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing LLM red-teaming approaches prioritize high attack success rate, often resulting in high-perplexity prompts. This focus overlooks low-perplexity attacks that are more difficult to filter, more likely to arise during benign usage, and more impactful as negative downstream training examples. In response, we introduce ASTPrompter, a single-step optimization method that uses contrastive preference learning to train an attacker to maintain low perplexity while achieving a high attack success rate (ASR). ASTPrompter achieves an attack success rate 5.1 times higher on Llama-8.1B while using inputs that are 2.1 times more likely to occur according to the frozen LLM. Furthermore, our attack transfers to Mistral-7B, Qwen-7B, and TinyLlama in both black- and white-box settings. Lastly, by tuning a single hyperparameter in our method, we discover successful attack prefixes along an efficient frontier between ASR and perplexity, highlighting perplexity as a previously under-considered factor in red-teaming.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3) reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.

  Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories, traditionally used for training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We propose a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a novel tree-structured setting for advantage estimation. This leads to a rich class of prefix-conditioned reward signals, which we analyze theoretically and empirically. Our initial results indicate that while structured advantage estimation can stabilize updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, challenges such as advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain. We propose heuristic and statistical solutions to mitigate these issues and discuss open challenges for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

  Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing returns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can complete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then, we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to solve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute significantly more turns even when small models have 100\% single-turn accuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations -- curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns. Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast, recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on the length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time compute for long-horizon tasks.

  The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples, limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities. Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of general-purpose agents for automating end-to-end machine learning (ML) workflows, including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and competition solving. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in task coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing to capture the full capabilities of such agents in realistic settings. We present TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three key innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system that automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities (e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty modeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and score dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A multi-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated AutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite, Medium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios. The Lite version, with 18 tasks and balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty levels, serves as a practical testbed for daily benchmarking and comparative studies.

  Knowledge graphs, a powerful tool for structuring information through relational triplets, have recently become the new front-runner in enhancing question-answering systems. While traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches are proficient in fact-based and local context-based extraction from concise texts, they encounter limitations when addressing the thematic and holistic understanding of complex, extensive texts, requiring a deeper analysis of both text and context. This paper presents a comprehensive technical comparative study of three different methodologies for constructing knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG, all leveraging open source technologies. We evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, and adaptability of these methods by analyzing their capabilities, state of development, and their impact on the performance of LLM-based question answering. Experimental results indicate that while OpenIE provides the most comprehensive coverage of triplets, GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning abilities among the three. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and limitations of each method and provide insights into future directions for improving knowledge graph-based question answering.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data science workflows, but existing models still struggle with multi-step reasoning and tool use, which limits their effectiveness on complex data analysis tasks. To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality, tool-based data analysis tasks and their executable multi-step solutions from real-world Jupyter notebooks and associated data files. Using this pipeline, we introduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that reflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To further enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that formulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model learning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit counts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search steps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on NbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench, respectively-matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks. Further evaluations demonstrate improved generalization and stronger tool-use reasoning across diverse multi-step reasoning tasks.

  The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\ R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set, and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2, GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity. Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in LLM-based pipelines.

  Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting. Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present TreeGPT, an attention-free neural architecture that explores the potential of pure TreeFFN encoder-decoder design for structured reasoning tasks. Unlike traditional transformer approaches that rely on attention mechanisms, TreeGPT employs bidirectional TreeFFN components that process sequences through adjacent connections in parallel, aiming to achieve computational efficiency while maintaining reasoning capabilities.Our approach centers on a TreeFFN Encoder-Decoder mechanism: $$\text{Encoder TreeFFN (L} \rightarrow \text{R)} + \text{Decoder TreeFFN (R} \leftarrow \text{L)} \rightarrow \text{Parallel Processing}$$ where the encoder processes left-to-right dependencies while the decoder handles right-to-left patterns, both using simple neighbor-to-neighbor connections. This design eliminates attention computation while maintaining sequence modeling capabilities.We evaluate our approach on the ARC Prize 2025 dataset, where TreeGPT achieves 99\% validation accuracy using 3.16M parameters. The model converges within 1500 training steps and demonstrates 100\% token-level accuracy on selected evaluation samples. Our preliminary results suggest that for certain structured reasoning tasks, specialized TreeFFN architectures may offer advantages over attention-based approaches. While these findings are encouraging, we acknowledge that further investigation across diverse tasks and datasets would be valuable to establish the broader applicability of attention-free designs.

  Ontology Matching (OM) is a cornerstone task of semantic interoperability, yet existing systems often rely on handcrafted rules or specialized models with limited adaptability. We present KROMA, a novel OM framework that harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to dynamically enrich the semantic context of OM tasks with structural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance and efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a lightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and substantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge retrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching, outperforming both classic OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches while keeping communication overhead comparable. Our study highlights the feasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted knowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology matching at scale.

  Robust workflow composition is critical for effective agent performance, yet progress in Large Language Model (LLM) planning and reasoning is hindered by a scarcity of scalable evaluation data. This work introduces NL2Flow, a fully automated pipeline for generating and evaluating workflow planning problems. NL2Flow generates problems parametrically in a structured intermediate representation, translating them into both natural language and formal PDDL. I evaluate several open-source, instruct-tuned LLMs on a dataset of 2296 low-difficulty problems generated by NL2Flow. Results demonstrate that the best-performing model achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal plans (for solvable problems). Regression analysis shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is contingent on both model and prompt design. Importantly, translating natural language problems into a structured JSON representation prior to symbolic planning significantly improved success rates, suggesting a benefit from neuro-symbolic integration. These findings underscore the importance of understanding error sources within LLM reasoning as systems scale to more complex tasks. As LLM reasoning scales to increasingly complex problems, understanding the shifting bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will be crucial.

  Desires motivate humans to interact autonomously with the complex world. In contrast, current AI agents require explicit task specifications, such as instructions or reward functions, which constrain their autonomy and behavioral diversity. In this paper, we introduce a Desire-driven Autonomous Agent (D2A) that can enable a large language model (LLM) to autonomously propose and select tasks, motivated by satisfying its multi-dimensional desires. Specifically, the motivational framework of D2A is mainly constructed by a dynamic Value System, inspired by the Theory of Needs. It incorporates an understanding of human-like desires, such as the need for social interaction, personal fulfillment, and self-care. At each step, the agent evaluates the value of its current state, proposes a set of candidate activities, and selects the one that best aligns with its intrinsic motivations. We conduct experiments on Concordia, a text-based simulator, to demonstrate that our agent generates coherent, contextually relevant daily activities while exhibiting variability and adaptability similar to human behavior. A comparative analysis with other LLM-based agents demonstrates that our approach significantly enhances the rationality of the simulated activities.
