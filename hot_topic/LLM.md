- **[The Duality of Generative AI and Reinforcement Learning in Robotics: A Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16411)**  `arXiv:2410.16411`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  Recently, generative AI and reinforcement learning (RL) have been redefining what is possible for AI agents that take information flows as input and produce intelligent behavior. As a result, we are seeing similar advancements in embodied AI and robotics for control policy generation. Our review paper examines the integration of generative AI models with RL to advance robotics. Our primary focus is on the duality between generative AI and RL for robotics downstream tasks. Specifically, we investigate: (1) The role of prominent generative AI tools as modular priors for multi-modal input fusion in RL tasks. (2) How RL can train, fine-tune and distill generative models for policy generation, such as VLA models, similarly to RL applications in large language models. We then propose a new taxonomy based on a considerable amount of selected papers.Lastly, we identify open challenges accounting for model scalability, adaptation and grounding, giving recommendations and insights on future research directions. We reflect on which generative AI models best fit the RL tasks and why. On the other side, we reflect on important issues inherent to RL-enhanced generative policies, such as safety concerns and failure modes, and what are the limitations of current methods. A curated collection of relevant research papers is maintained on our GitHub repository, serving as a resource for ongoing research and development in this field:this https URL.

- **[FCRF: Flexible Constructivism Reflection for Long-Horizon Robotic Task Planning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14975)**  `arXiv:2507.14975`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Autonomous error correction is critical for domestic robots to achieve reliable execution of complex long-horizon tasks. Prior work has explored self-reflection in Large Language Models (LLMs) for task planning error correction; however, existing methods are constrained by inflexible self-reflection mechanisms that limit their effectiveness. Motivated by these limitations and inspired by human cognitive adaptation, we propose the Flexible Constructivism Reflection Framework (FCRF), a novel Mentor-Actor architecture that enables LLMs to perform flexible self-reflection based on task difficulty, while constructively integrating historical valuable experience with failure lessons. We evaluated FCRF on diverse domestic tasks through simulation in AlfWorld and physical deployment in the real-world environment. Experimental results demonstrate that FCRF significantly improves overall performance and self-reflection flexibility in complex long-horizon robotic tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the increasing demand for heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms to perform complex tasks in urban environments, system design now faces major challenges, including efficient semantic understanding, flexible task planning, and the ability to dynamically adjust coordination strategies in response to evolving environmental conditions and continuously changing task requirements. To address the limitations of existing methods, this paper proposes CoordField, a coordination field agent system for coordinating heterogeneous drone swarms in complex urban scenarios. In this system, large language models (LLMs) is responsible for interpreting high-level human instructions and converting them into executable commands for the UAV swarms, such as patrol and target tracking. Subsequently, a Coordination field mechanism is proposed to guide UAV motion and task selection, enabling decentralized and adaptive allocation of emergent tasks. A total of 50 rounds of comparative testing were conducted across different models in a 2D simulation space to evaluate their performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior performance in terms of task coverage, response time, and adaptability to dynamic changes.

- **[Stimulating Imagination: Towards General-purpose "Something Something Placement"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01655)**  `arXiv:2408.01655`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Jianyang Wu, Jie Gu, Xiaokang Ma, Fangzhou Qiu, Chu Tang, Jingmin Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  General-purpose object placement is a fundamental capability of an intelligent generalist robot: being capable of rearranging objects following precise human instructions even in novel environments. This work is dedicated to achieving general-purpose object placement with ``something something'' instructions. Specifically, we break the entire process down into three parts, including object localization, goal imagination and robot control, and propose a method named SPORT. SPORT leverages a pre-trained large vision model for broad semantic reasoning about objects, and learns a diffusion-based pose estimator to ensure physically-realistic results in 3D space. Only object types (movable or reference) are communicated between these two parts, which brings two benefits. One is that we can fully leverage the powerful ability of open-set object recognition and localization since no specific fine-tuning is needed for the robotic scenario. Moreover, the diffusion-based estimator only need to ``imagine" the object poses after the placement, while no necessity for their semantic information. Thus the training burden is greatly reduced and no massive training is required. The training data for the goal pose estimation is collected in simulation and annotated by using GPT-4. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. SPORT can not only generate promising 3D goal poses for unseen simulated objects, but also be seamlessly applied to real-world settings.

- **[Interleaved LLM and Motion Planning for Generalized Multi-Object Collection in Large Scene Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15782)**  `arXiv:2507.15782`  `cs.RO`  
  _Ruochu Yang, Yu Zhou, Fumin Zhang, Mengxue Hou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Household robots have been a longstanding research topic, but they still lack human-like intelligence, particularly in manipulating open-set objects and navigating large environments efficiently and accurately. To push this boundary, we consider a generalized multi-object collection problem in large scene graphs, where the robot needs to pick up and place multiple objects across multiple locations in a long mission of multiple human commands. This problem is extremely challenging since it requires long-horizon planning in a vast action-state space under high uncertainties. To this end, we propose a novel interleaved LLM and motion planning algorithm Inter-LLM. By designing a multimodal action cost similarity function, our algorithm can both reflect the history and look into the future to optimize plans, striking a good balance of quality and efficiency. Simulation experiments demonstrate that compared with latest works, our algorithm improves the overall mission performance by 30% in terms of fulfilling human commands, maximizing mission success rates, and minimizing mission costs.

- **[Making VLMs More Robot-Friendly: Self-Critical Distillation of Low-Level Procedural Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08224)**  `arXiv:2507.08224`  `cs.RO`  
  _Chan Young Park, Jillian Fisher, Marius Memmel, Dipika Khullar, Seoho Yun, Abhishek Gupta, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in robotic procedural planning, yet their human-centric reasoning often omits the low-level, grounded details needed for robotic execution. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a path toward more perceptually grounded plans, but current methods either rely on expensive, large-scale models or are constrained to narrow simulation settings. We introduce SelfReVision, a lightweight and scalable self-improvement framework for vision-language procedural planning. SelfReVision enables small VLMs to iteratively critique, revise, and verify their own plans-without external supervision or teacher models-drawing inspiration from chain-of-thought prompting and self-instruct paradigms. Through this self-distillation loop, models generate higher-quality, execution-ready plans that can be used both at inference and for continued fine-tuning. Using models varying from 3B to 72B, our results show that SelfReVision not only boosts performance over weak base VLMs but also outperforms models 100X the size, yielding improved control in downstream embodied tasks.

- **[Intelligent LiDAR Navigation: Leveraging External Information and Semantic Maps with LLM as Copilot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08493)**  `arXiv:2409.08493`  `cs.RO`  
  _Fujing Xie, Jiajie Zhang, S√∂ren Schwertfeger_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional robot navigation systems primarily utilize occupancy grid maps and laser-based sensing technologies, as demonstrated by the popular move_base package in ROS. Unlike robots, humans navigate not only through spatial awareness and physical distances but also by integrating external information, such as elevator maintenance updates from public notification boards and experiential knowledge, like the need for special access through certain doors. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), which possesses text understanding and intelligence close to human performance, there is now an opportunity to infuse robot navigation systems with a level of understanding akin to human cognition. In this study, we propose using osmAG (Area Graph in OpensStreetMap textual format), an innovative semantic topometric hierarchical map representation, to bridge the gap between the capabilities of ROS move_base and the contextual understanding offered by LLMs. Our methodology employs LLMs as an actual copilot in robot navigation, enabling the integration of a broader range of informational inputs while maintaining the robustness of traditional robotic navigation systems.

- **[Advancing Object Goal Navigation Through LLM-enhanced Object Affinities Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09971)**  `arXiv:2403.09971`  `cs.RO`  
  _Mengying Lin, Shugao Liu, Dingxi Zhang, Yaran Chen, Zhaoran Wang, Haoran Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object-goal navigation requires mobile robots to efficiently locate targets with visual and spatial information, yet existing methods struggle with generalization in unseen environments. Heuristic approaches with naive metrics fail in complex layouts, while graph-based and learning-based methods suffer from environmental biases and limited generalization. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) as planners or agents offer a rich knowledge base, they are cost-inefficient and lack targeted historical experience. To address these challenges, we propose the LLM-enhanced Object Affinities Transfer (LOAT) framework, integrating LLM-derived semantics with learning-based approaches to leverage experiential object affinities for better generalization in unseen settings. LOAT employs a dual-module strategy: one module accesses LLMs' vast knowledge, and the other applies learned object semantic relationships, dynamically fusing these sources based on context. Evaluations in AI2-THOR and Habitat simulators show significant improvements in navigation success and efficiency, and real-world deployment demonstrates the zero-shot ability of LOAT to enhance object-goal navigation systems.

- **[LLM Economist: Large Population Models and Mechanism Design in Multi-Agent Generative Simulacra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15815)**  `arXiv:2507.15815`  `cs.MA` `cs.LG`  
  _Seth Karten, Wenzhe Li, Zihan Ding, Samuel Kleiner, Yu Bai, Chi Jin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present the LLM Economist, a novel framework that uses agent-based modeling to design and assess economic policies in strategic environments with hierarchical decision-making. At the lower level, bounded rational worker agents -- instantiated as persona-conditioned prompts sampled from U.S. Census-calibrated income and demographic statistics -- choose labor supply to maximize text-based utility functions learned in-context. At the upper level, a planner agent employs in-context reinforcement learning to propose piecewise-linear marginal tax schedules anchored to the current U.S. federal brackets. This construction endows economic simulacra with three capabilities requisite for credible fiscal experimentation: (i) optimization of heterogeneous utilities, (ii) principled generation of large, demographically realistic agent populations, and (iii) mechanism design -- the ultimate nudging problem -- expressed entirely in natural language. Experiments with populations of up to one hundred interacting agents show that the planner converges near Stackelberg equilibria that improve aggregate social welfare relative to Saez solutions, while a periodic, persona-level voting procedure furthers these gains under decentralized governance. These results demonstrate that large language model-based agents can jointly model, simulate, and govern complex economic systems, providing a tractable test bed for policy evaluation at the societal scale to help build better civilizations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces LUCID-MA (Learning and Understanding Crime through Dialogue of Multiple Agents), an innovative AI powered framework where multiple AI agents collaboratively analyze and understand crime data. Our system that consists of three core components: an analysis assistant that highlights spatiotemporal crime patterns; a feedback component that reviews and refines analytical results; and a prediction component that forecasts future crime trends. With a well-designed prompt and the LLaMA-2-13B-Chat-GPTQ model, it runs completely offline and allows the agents undergo self-improvement through 100 rounds of communication with less human interaction. A scoring function is incorporated to evaluate agent performance, providing visual plots to track learning progress. This work demonstrates the potential of AutoGen-style agents for autonomous, scalable, and iterative analysis in social science domains, maintaining data privacy through offline execution. It also showcases a computational model with emergent intelligence, where the system's global behavior emerges from the interactions of its agents. This emergent behavior manifests as enhanced individual agent performance, driven by collaborative dialogue between the LLM-based agents.

- **[EduThink4AI: Translating Educational Critical Thinking into Multi-Agent LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15015)**  `arXiv:2507.15015`  `cs.MA`  
  _Xinmeng Hou, Zhouquan Lu, Wenli Chen, Hai Hu, Qing Guo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential as educational tutoring agents, capable of tailoring hints, orchestrating lessons, and grading with near-human finesse across various academic domains. However, current LLM-based educational systems exhibit critical limitations in promoting genuine critical thinking, failing on over one-third of multi-hop questions with counterfactual premises, and remaining vulnerable to adversarial prompts that trigger biased or factually incorrect responses. To address these gaps, we propose EDU-Prompting, a novel multi-agent framework that bridges established educational critical thinking theories with LLM agent design to generate critical, bias-aware explanations while fostering diverse perspectives. Our systematic evaluation across theoretical benchmarks and practical college-level critical writing scenarios demonstrates that EDU-Prompting significantly enhances both content truthfulness and logical soundness in AI-generated educational responses. The framework's modular design enables seamless integration into existing prompting frameworks and educational applications, allowing practitioners to directly incorporate critical thinking catalysts that promote analytical reasoning and introduce multiple perspectives without requiring extensive system modifications.

- **[LLM-Enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Expert Workflow for Real-Time P2P Energy Trading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14995)**  `arXiv:2507.14995`  `cs.MA`  
  _Chengwei Lou, Zekai Jin, Wei Tang, Guangfei Geng, Jin Yang, Lu Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-time peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity markets dynamically adapt to fluctuations in renewable energy and variations in demand, maximizing economic benefits through instantaneous price responses while enhancing grid flexibility. However, scaling expert guidance for massive personalized prosumers poses critical challenges, including diverse decision-making demands and lack of customized modeling frameworks. This paper proposed an integrated large language model-multi-agent reinforcement learning (LLM-MARL) framework for real-time P2P energy trading to address challenges such as the limited technical capability of prosumers, the lack of expert experience, and security issues of distribution networks. LLMs are introduced as experts to generate personalized strategy, guiding MARL under the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm through imitation learning. A differential attention-based critic network is designed to enhance convergence performance. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM generated strategies effectively substitute human experts. The proposed multi-agent imitation learning algorithms achieve significantly lower economic costs and voltage violation rates on test sets compared to baselines algorithms, while maintaining robust stability. This work provides an effective solution for real-time P2P electricity market decision-making by bridging expert knowledge with agent learning.

- **[ChronoSense: Exploring Temporal Understanding in Large Language Models with Time Intervals of Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03040)**  `arXiv:2501.03040`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Duygu Sezen Islakoglu, Jan-Christoph Kalo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various NLP tasks, yet they still face significant challenges in reasoning and arithmetic. Temporal reasoning, a critical component of natural language understanding, has raised increasing research attention. However, comprehensive testing of Allen's interval relations (e.g., before, after, during) -- a fundamental framework for temporal relationships -- remains underexplored. To fill this gap, we present ChronoSense, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' temporal understanding. It includes 16 tasks, focusing on identifying the Allen relation between two temporal events and temporal arithmetic, using both abstract events and real-world data from Wikidata. We assess the performance of seven recent LLMs using this benchmark and the results indicate that models handle Allen relations, even symmetrical ones, quite differently. Moreover, the findings suggest that the models may rely on memorization to answer time-related questions. Overall, the models' low performance highlights the need for improved temporal understanding in LLMs and ChronoSense offers a robust framework for future research in this area.

- **[STUN: Structured-Then-Unstructured Pruning for Scalable MoE Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06211)**  `arXiv:2409.06211`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Jaeseong Lee, seung-won hwang, Aurick Qiao, Daniel F Campos, Zhewei Yao, Yuxiong He_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mixture-of-experts (MoEs) have been adopted for reducing inference costs by sparsely activating experts in Large language models (LLMs). Despite this reduction, the massive number of experts in MoEs still makes them expensive to serve. In this paper, we study how to address this, by pruning MoEs. Among pruning methodologies, unstructured pruning has been known to achieve the highest performance for a given pruning ratio, compared to structured pruning, since the latter imposes constraints on the sparsification structure. This is intuitive, as the solution space of unstructured pruning subsumes that of structured pruning. However, our counterintuitive finding reveals that expert pruning, a form of structured pruning, can actually precede unstructured pruning to outperform unstructured-only pruning. As existing expert pruning, requiring $O(\frac{k^n}{\sqrt{n}})$ forward passes for $n$ experts, cannot scale for recent MoEs, we propose a scalable alternative with $O(1)$ complexity, yet outperforming the more expensive methods. The key idea is leveraging a latent structure between experts, based on behavior similarity, such that the greedy decision of whether to prune closely captures the joint pruning effect. Ours is highly effective -- for Snowflake Arctic, a 480B-sized MoE with 128 experts, our method needs only one H100 and two hours to achieve nearly no loss in performance with 40% sparsity, even in generative tasks such as GSM8K, where state-of-the-art unstructured pruning fails to. The code will be made publicly available.

- **[Diffusion Beats Autoregressive in Data-Constrained Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15857)**  `arXiv:2507.15857`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Mihir Prabhudesai, Menging Wu, Amir Zadeh, Katerina Fragkiadaki, Deepak Pathak_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm. Our code is available at:this https URL.

- **[Small LLMs Do Not Learn a Generalizable Theory of Mind via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15788)**  `arXiv:2507.15788`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Sneheel Sarangi, Hanan Salam_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent capabilities in complex reasoning, largely spurred by rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques applied during the post-training. This has raised the question of whether similar methods can instill more nuanced, human-like social intelligence, such as a Theory of Mind (ToM), in LLMs. This paper investigates whether small-scale LLMs can acquire a robust and generalizable ToM capability through RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We conduct a systematic evaluation by training models on various combinations of prominent ToM datasets (HiToM, ExploreToM, FANToM) and testing for generalization on held-out datasets (e.g., OpenToM). Our findings indicate that small LLMs struggle to develop a generic ToM capability. While performance on in-distribution tasks improves, this capability fails to transfer to unseen ToM tasks with different characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prolonged RL training leads to models ``hacking'' the statistical patterns of the training datasets, resulting in significant performance gains on in-domain data but no change, or degradation of performance on out-of-distribution tasks. This suggests the learned behavior is a form of narrow overfitting rather than the acquisition of a true, abstract ToM capability.

- **[Data Mixing Agent: Learning to Re-weight Domains for Continual Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15640)**  `arXiv:2507.15640`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Kailai Yang, Xiao Liu, Lei Ji, Hao Li, Yeyun Gong, Peng Cheng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual pre-training on small-scale task-specific data is an effective method for improving large language models in new target fields, yet it risks catastrophic forgetting of their original capabilities. A common solution is to re-weight training data mixtures from source and target fields on a domain space to achieve balanced performance. Previous domain reweighting strategies rely on manual designation with certain heuristics based on human intuition or empirical results. In this work, we prove that more general heuristics can be parameterized by proposing Data Mixing Agent, the first model-based, end-to-end framework that learns to re-weight domains. The agent learns generalizable heuristics through reinforcement learning on large quantities of data mixing trajectories with corresponding feedback from an evaluation environment. Experiments in continual pre-training on math reasoning show that Data Mixing Agent outperforms strong baselines in achieving balanced performance across source and target field benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes well across unseen source fields, target models, and domain spaces without retraining. Direct application to the code generation field also indicates its adaptability across target domains. Further analysis showcases the agents' well-aligned heuristics with human intuitions and their efficiency in achieving superior model performance with less source-field data.

- **[Solo Connection: A Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning Technique for Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14353)**  `arXiv:2507.14353`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Harsh Nilesh Pathak, Randy Paffenroth_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT) is a versatile and extensible approach for adapting a Large Language Model (LLM) for newer tasks. One of the most prominent PEFT approaches, Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), primarily focuses on adjusting the attention weight matrices within individual decoder blocks of a Generative Pre trained Transformer (GPT2). In contrast, we introduce Solo Connection a novel method that adapts the representation at the decoder-block level rather than modifying individual weight matrices. Not only does Solo Connection outperform LoRA on E2E natural language generation benchmarks, but it also reduces the number of trainable parameters by 59% relative to LoRA and by more than 99% compared to full fine-tuning of GPT2, an early version of Large Language Models (LLMs). Solo Connection is also motivated by homotopy theory: we introduce a trainable linear transformation that gradually interpolates between a zero vector and the task-specific representation, enabling smooth and stable adaptation over time. While skip connections in the original 12 layer GPT2 are typically confined to individual decoder blocks, subsequent GPT2 variants scale up to 48 layers, and even larger language models can include 128 or more decoder blocks. These expanded architectures underscore the need to revisit how skip connections are employed during fine-tuning. This paper focuses on long skip connections that link outputs of different decoder blocks, potentially enhancing the model's ability to adapt to new tasks while leveraging pre-trained knowledge.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in numerous applications requiring robust long-range capabilities, essential for processing extensive input contexts and continuously generating extended outputs. As sequence lengths increase, the number of Key-Value (KV) pairs in LLMs escalates, creating a significant efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free method for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables LLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range modeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without running out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key innovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only sequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from shallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range dependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range capabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively compresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache size. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective continuous generation under constrained cache budgets. Experiments across various tasks, benchmarks, and LLM models consistently validate LaCache's effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' long-range capabilities. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and intentions is crucial for their utility, honesty, and safety. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a popular approach to achieve this alignment, but it faces challenges in computational efficiency and training stability. Recent methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) have proposed offline alternatives to RLHF, simplifying the process by reparameterizing the reward function. However, DPO depends on a potentially suboptimal reference model, and SimPO's assumption of a fixed target reward margin may lead to suboptimal decisions in diverse data settings. In this work, we propose $\alpha$-DPO, an adaptive preference optimization algorithm designed to address these limitations by introducing a dynamic reward margin. Specifically, $\alpha$-DPO employs an adaptive preference distribution, balancing the policy model and the reference model to achieve personalized reward margins. We provide theoretical guarantees for $\alpha$-DPO, demonstrating its effectiveness as a surrogate optimization objective and its ability to balance alignment and diversity through KL divergence control. Empirical evaluations on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard show that $\alpha$-DPO consistently outperforms DPO and SimPO across various model settings, establishing it as a robust approach for fine-tuning LLMs. Our method achieves significant improvements in win rates, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for LLM alignment.

- **[FASTGEN: Fast and Cost-Effective Synthetic Tabular Data Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15839)**  `arXiv:2507.15839`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Anh Nguyen, Sam Schafft, Nicholas Hale, John Alfaro_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Synthetic data generation has emerged as an invaluable solution in scenarios where real-world data collection and usage are limited by cost and scarcity. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in producing high-fidelity, domain-relevant samples across various fields. However, existing approaches that directly use LLMs to generate each record individually impose prohibitive time and cost burdens, particularly when large volumes of synthetic data are required. In this work, we propose a fast, cost-effective method for realistic tabular data synthesis that leverages LLMs to infer and encode each field's distribution into a reusable sampling script. By automatically classifying fields into numerical, categorical, or free-text types, the LLM generates distribution-based scripts that can efficiently produce diverse, realistic datasets at scale without continuous model inference. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional direct methods in both diversity and data realism, substantially reducing the burden of high-volume synthetic data generation. We plan to apply this methodology to accelerate testing in production pipelines, thereby shortening development cycles and improving overall system efficiency. We believe our insights and lessons learned will aid researchers and practitioners seeking scalable, cost-effective solutions for synthetic data generation.

- **[Exploring the In-Context Learning Capabilities of LLMs for Money Laundering Detection in Financial Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14785)**  `arXiv:2507.14785`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Erfan Pirmorad_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The complexity and interconnectivity of entities involved in money laundering demand investigative reasoning over graph-structured data. This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines over localized subgraphs extracted from a financial knowledge graph. We propose a lightweight pipeline that retrieves k-hop neighborhoods around entities of interest, serializes them into structured text, and prompts an LLM via few-shot in-context learning to assess suspiciousness and generate justifications. Using synthetic anti-money laundering (AML) scenarios that reflect common laundering behaviors, we show that LLMs can emulate analyst-style logic, highlight red flags, and provide coherent explanations. While this study is exploratory, it illustrates the potential of LLM-based graph reasoning in AML and lays groundwork for explainable, language-driven financial crime analytics.

  The advancement of general-purpose artificial intelligence relies on large language models (LLMs) that excel across a wide range of tasks, from structured reasoning to creative generation. However, post-training methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often struggle with generalization, favoring memorization over transferable learning. In this work, we introduce Omni-Think, a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enhances LLM performance across diverse tasks by combining rule-based verifiable rewards with generative preference signals via LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Our approach enables consistent optimization across task types and scales RL-based training to subjective domains. We further investigate training strategies, demonstrating that a curriculum-based progression that orders tasks from structured to open-ended improves performance and reduces forgetting. Experimental results across four domains reveal that curriculum learning improves performance by 5.2\% over joint training and 9.1\% over model merging. These results highlight the importance of task-aware sampling and hybrid supervision in scaling RL-based post-training for general-purpose LLMs.

  Prompt-based continual learning (CL) offers a parameter-efficient way to adapt large language models (LLMs) across task sequences. However, most existing methods assume task-aware inference and maintain a growing list of task-specific prompts, which limits scalability and hides latent forgetting. In this work, we introduce GRID, a unified framework that addresses two key limitations: (1) latent forgetting under task-agnostic inference, and (2) prompt memory explosion as task sequences grow. GRID integrates a task-aware decoding mechanism that improves backward transfer by leveraging representative inputs, automatic task identification, and constrained decoding. Additionally, we propose a gradient-based prompt selection strategy that compresses less informative prompts into a single aggregated representation, enabling scalable and memory-efficient lifelong learning. Extensive experiments across short-sequence, long-sequence, and negative transfer benchmarks show that GRID significantly improves backward transfer, achieves competitive forward transfer, and reduces forgotten tasks by up to 80\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on T5 and Flan-T5 backbones.

  Automated theorem proving (ATP) has been a classical problem in artificial intelligence since its inception, yet it remains challenging due to its vast state and action space. Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising heuristic for ATP, but they lack correctness guarantees and thus require interaction with a proof verifier. Such interactions typically follow one of two approaches: black-box interaction, which does not utilize intermediate proof states, or white-box approaches, which allow for incremental proof construction and examination of intermediate states. While black-box approaches have directly benefited from recent LLM advances, white-box methods have comparatively lagged behind. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing LeanTree, which consists of (i) a tool built in the Lean 4 language that factorizes complex proof states into simpler, independent branches, and (ii) a dataset of these factorized intermediate states. Our white-box tooling offers several advantages over black-box approaches: it simplifies evaluation, reduces necessary context, generates richer training data, enables parallel search across multiple states, supports efficient reuse of states, and provides feedback in case of errors. Our preliminary results hint that white-box approaches outperform black-box alternatives in some settings.

  Multi-turn problem solving is critical yet challenging for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to reflect on their reasoning and revise from feedback. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a single-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models trained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems across multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual feedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect their answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training models with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., "Let's try again") after wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn reasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement learning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative problem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training setups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn performance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling language models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To further minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while encouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures that guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

  Autoregressive and recurrent networks have achieved remarkable progress across various fields, from weather forecasting to molecular generation and Large Language Models. Despite their strong predictive capabilities, these models lack a rigorous framework for addressing uncertainty, which is key in scientific applications such as PDE solving, molecular generation and Machine Learning Force Fields. To address this shortcoming we present BARNN: a variational Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network. BARNNs aim to provide a principled way to turn any autoregressive or recurrent model into its Bayesian version. BARNN is based on the variational dropout method, allowing to apply it to large recurrent neural networks as well. We also introduce a temporal version of the "Variational Mixtures of Posteriors" prior (tVAMP-prior) to make Bayesian inference efficient and well-calibrated. Extensive experiments on PDE modelling and molecular generation demonstrate that BARNN not only achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, but also excels in uncertainty quantification and modelling long-range dependencies.

  High-level automation is increasingly critical in AI, driven by rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. However, LLMs, despite their general reasoning power, struggle significantly in specialized, data-sensitive tasks such as designing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This difficulty arises from (1) the inherent knowledge gaps in modeling the intricate, varying relationships between graph properties and suitable architectures and (2) the external noise from misleading descriptive inputs, often resulting in generic or even misleading model suggestions. Achieving proficiency in designing data-aware models -- defined as the meta-level capability to systematically accumulate, interpret, and apply data-specific design knowledge -- remains challenging for existing automated approaches, due to their inefficient construction and application of meta-knowledge. To achieve the meta-level proficiency, we propose DesiGNN, a knowledge-centered framework that systematically converts past model design experiences into structured, fine-grained knowledge priors well fitted to meta-learning with LLMs. To account for the inherent variability and external noise, DesiGNN aligns empirical property filtering from extensive benchmarks with adaptive elicitation of literature insights via LLMs. By constructing a solid meta-knowledge between unseen graph understanding and known effective architecture patterns, DesiGNN can deliver top-5.77% initial model proposals for unseen datasets within seconds, and achieve consistently superior performance with minimal search costs against baselines.

  Electronic Health Records (EHR) contain valuable clinical information for predicting patient outcomes and guiding healthcare decisions. However, effectively modeling Electronic Health Records (EHRs) requires addressing data heterogeneity and complex temporal patterns. Standard approaches often struggle with irregular time intervals between clinical events. We propose TALE-EHR, a Transformer-based framework featuring a novel time-aware attention mechanism that explicitly models continuous temporal gaps to capture fine-grained sequence dynamics. To complement this temporal modeling with robust semantics, TALE-EHR leverages embeddings derived from standardized code descriptions using a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM), providing a strong foundation for understanding clinical concepts. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV and PIC dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on tasks such as disease progression forecasting. TALE-EHR underscores the benefit of integrating explicit, continuous temporal modeling with strong semantic representations provides a powerful solution for advancing EHR analysis.

  Concerned with privacy threats, memorization in LLMs is often seen as undesirable, specifically for learning. In this paper, we study whether memorization can be avoided when optimally learning a language, and whether the privacy threat posed by memorization is exaggerated or not. To this end, we re-examine existing privacy-focused measures of memorization, namely recollection-based and counterfactual memorization, along with a newly proposed contextual memorization.Relating memorization to local over-fitting during learning, contextual memorization aims to disentangle memorization from the contextual learning ability of LLMs. Informally, a string is contextually memorized if its recollection due to training exceeds the optimal contextual recollection, a learned threshold denoting the best contextual learning without training. Conceptually, contextual recollection avoids the fallacy of recollection-based memorization, where any form of high recollection is a sign of memorization. Theoretically, contextual memorization relates to counterfactual memorization, but imposes stronger conditions. Memorization measures differ in outcomes and information requirements.Experimenting on 18 LLMs from 6 families and multiple formal languages of different entropy, we show that (a) memorization measures disagree on memorization order of varying frequent strings, (b) optimal learning of a language cannot avoid partial memorization of training strings, and (c) improved learning decreases contextual and counterfactual memorization but increases recollection-based memorization. Finally, (d) we revisit existing reports of memorized strings by recollection that neither pose a privacy threat nor are contextually or counterfactually memorized.

  The integration of generative AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), into real-time multi-model AI applications such as video conferencing and gaming is giving rise to a new class of workloads: real-time generative AI (RTGen). These workloads combine the compute intensity and dynamic execution patterns of generative models with the stringent latency and concurrency constraints of real-time inference. To meet the diverse demands of RTGen workloads, modern edge platforms increasingly adopt heterogeneous system-on-chip (SoC) architectures that integrate CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs. Despite the potential of heterogeneous SoC, the scheduling space complexity and performance implications of RTGen workloads on such platforms remain underexplored. In this work, we perform a comprehensive characterization of RTGen workloads on AMD's latest heterogeneous SoC, Ryzen AI. We construct realistic multi-model scenarios inspired by industry use cases and profile model performance across all available backends. Using this data, we evaluate five scheduling policies and their impact on both real-time metrics (e.g., deadline violation rate) and LLM performance (e.g., time-to-first-token and tokens-per-second). Our results show that scheduling decisions significantly affect workload performance (e.g., leading to a 41.7% difference in deadline violation rates on average), and highlight the need for scheduling strategies that are aware of workload dynamics and hardware heterogeneity. Our findings underscore the importance of workload-aware, dynamic heterogeneous scheduling in enabling high-performance, on-device RTGen applications.

  Contemporary large models often exhibit behaviors suggesting the presence of low-level primitives that compose into modules with richer functionality, but these fundamental building blocks remain poorly understood. We investigate this compositional structure in linear layers by asking: can we identify/synthesize linear transformations from a minimal set of geometric primitives? Using Clifford algebra, we show that linear layers can be expressed as compositions of bivectors -- geometric objects encoding oriented planes -- and introduce a differentiable algorithm that decomposes them into products of rotors. This construction uses only O(log^2 d) parameters, versus O(d^2) required by dense matrices. Applied to the key, query, and value projections in LLM attention layers, our rotor-based layers match the performance of strong baselines such as block-Hadamard and low-rank approximations. Our findings provide an algebraic perspective on how these geometric primitives can compose into higher-level functions within deep models.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in complex reasoning tasks, but their inference remains computationally inefficient. We observe a common failure mode in many prevalent LLMs, overthinking, where models generate verbose and tangential reasoning traces even for simple queries. Recent works have tried to mitigate this by enforcing fixed token budgets, however, this can lead to underthinking, especially on harder problems. Through empirical analysis, we identify that this inefficiency often stems from unclear problem-solving strategies. To formalize this, we develop a theoretical model, BBAM (Bayesian Budget Allocation Model), which models reasoning as a sequence of sub-questions with varying uncertainty, and introduce the $E^3$ metric to capture the trade-off between correctness and computation efficiency. Building on theoretical results from BBAM, we propose Plan-and-Budget, a model-agnostic, test-time framework that decomposes complex queries into sub-questions and allocates token budgets based on estimated complexity using adaptive scheduling. Plan-and-Budget improves reasoning efficiency across a range of tasks and models, achieving up to +70% accuracy gains, -39% token reduction, and +187.5% improvement in $E^3$. Notably, it elevates a smaller model (DS-Qwen-32B) to match the efficiency of a larger model (DS-LLaMA-70B)-demonstrating Plan-and-Budget's ability to close performance gaps without retraining.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem widely applied in logistics distribution and transportation management. Its complexity stems from the constraints of vehicle capacity and time windows, which pose significant challenges to traditional approaches. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new possibilities for finding approximate solutions to CVRPTW. This paper proposes a novel LLM-enhanced Q-learning framework to address the CVRPTW with real-time emergency constraints. Our solution introduces an adaptive two-phase training mechanism that transitions from the LLM-guided exploration phase to the autonomous optimization phase of Q-network. To ensure reliability, we design a three-tier self-correction mechanism based on the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for LLMs: syntactic validation, semantic verification, and physical constraint enforcement. In addition, we also prioritized replay of the experience generated by LLMs to amplify the regulatory role of LLMs in the architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a 7.3\% average reduction in cost compared to traditional Q-learning, with fewer training steps required for convergence.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for image-based regression tasks, but current approaches face key limitations. Recent methods fine-tune MLLMs using preset output vocabularies and generic task-level prompts (e.g., "How would you rate this image?"), assuming this mimics human rating behavior. Our analysis reveals these approaches provide no benefit over image-only training. Models using preset vocabularies and generic prompts perform equivalently to image-only models, failing to leverage semantic understanding from textual input. We propose Regression via Transformer-Based Classification (RvTC), which replaces vocabulary-constrained classification with a flexible bin-based approach. Unlike approaches that address discretization errors through complex distributional modeling, RvTC eliminates manual vocabulary crafting through straightforward bin increase, achieving state-of-the-art performance on four image assessment datasets using only images. More importantly, we demonstrate that data-specific prompts dramatically improve performance. Unlike generic task descriptions, prompts containing semantic information about specific images enable MLLMs to leverage cross-modal understanding. On the AVA dataset, adding challenge titles to prompts improves correlations from 0.83 to 0.90, a new state-of-the-art. We demonstrate through empirical evidence from the AVA and AGIQA-3k datasets that MLLMs benefit from semantic prompt information surpassing mere statistical biases. This underscores the importance of incorporating meaningful textual context in multimodal regression tasks.

  Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their performance on complex, multi-page document comprehension remains inadequate, largely due to the lack of high-quality, document-level datasets. While current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods offer partial solutions, they suffer from issues, such as fragmented retrieval contexts, multi-stage error accumulation, and extra time costs of retrieval. In this work, we present a high-quality document-level dataset, Doc-750K, designed to support in-depth understanding of multimodal documents. This dataset includes diverse document structures, extensive cross-page dependencies, and real question-answer pairs derived from the original documents. Building on the dataset, we develop a native multimodal model, Docopilot, which can accurately handle document-level dependencies without relying on RAG. Experiments demonstrate that Docopilot achieves superior coherence, accuracy, and efficiency in document understanding tasks and multi-turn interactions, setting a new baseline for document-level multimodal understanding.

  Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model (MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA (TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module, inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing training resource consumption by a substantial margin.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain, enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments, especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment, semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with LLM-generated temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision. Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues, we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly visual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements in the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities.

  Intraoperative bleeding during Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) poses significant risks, demanding precise, real-time localization and continuous monitoring of the bleeding source for effective hemostatic intervention. In particular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only milliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs operations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the critical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in the challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual obstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of specialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance systems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first comprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with 39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6 challenging clinical scenarios. We also present BleedOrigin-Net, a novel dual-stage detection-tracking framework for the bleeding source localization in ESD procedures, addressing the complete workflow from bleeding onset detection to continuous spatial tracking. We compare with widely-used object detection models (YOLOv11/v12), multimodal large language models, and point tracking methods. Extensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 96.85% frame-level accuracy ($\pm\leq8$ frames) for bleeding onset detection, 70.24% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for initial source detection, and 96.11% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for point tracking.

  Current diffusion models for human image animation often struggle to maintain identity (ID) consistency, especially when the reference image and driving video differ significantly in body size or position. We introduce StableAnimator++, the first ID-preserving video diffusion framework with learnable pose alignment, capable of generating high-quality videos conditioned on a reference image and a pose sequence without any post-processing. Building upon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed modules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In particular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the similarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven poses via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These matrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating misalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face embeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a global content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a distribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal layers while preserving ID via distribution alignment. During the inference stage, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) based face optimization integrated into the denoising process, guiding the diffusion trajectory for enhanced facial fidelity. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of StableAnimator++ both qualitatively and quantitatively.

  Multi-face deepfake videos are becoming increasingly prevalent, often appearing in natural social settings that challenge existing detection methods. Most current approaches excel at single-face detection but struggle in multi-face scenarios, due to a lack of awareness of crucial contextual cues. In this work, we develop a novel approach that leverages human cognition to analyze and defend against multi-face deepfake videos. Through a series of human studies, we systematically examine how people detect deepfake faces in social settings. Our quantitative analysis reveals four key cues humans rely on: scene-motion coherence, inter-face appearance compatibility, interpersonal gaze alignment, and face-body consistency. Guided by these insights, we introduce \textsf{HICOM}, a novel framework designed to detect every fake face in multi-face scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that \textsf{HICOM} improves average accuracy by 3.3\% in in-dataset detection and 2.8\% under real-world perturbations. Moreover, it outperforms existing methods by 5.8\% on unseen datasets, demonstrating the generalization of human-inspired cues. \textsf{HICOM} further enhances interpretability by incorporating an LLM to provide human-readable explanations, making detection results more transparent and convincing. Our work sheds light on involving human factors to enhance defense against deepfakes.

  Video Question Answering (VideoQA) requires identifying sparse critical moments in long videos and reasoning about their causal relationships to answer semantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate accurate, contextually-grounded answers.

  Whole slide images (WSIs) are vital in digital pathology, enabling gigapixel tissue analysis across various pathological tasks. While recent advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) allow multi-task WSI analysis through natural language, they often underperform compared to task-specific models. Collaborative multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising solution to balance versatility and accuracy in healthcare, yet their potential remains underexplored in pathology-specific domains. To address these issues, we propose WSI-Agents, a novel collaborative multi-agent system for multi-modal WSI analysis. WSI-Agents integrates specialized functional agents with robust task allocation and verification mechanisms to enhance both task-specific accuracy and multi-task versatility through three components: (1) a task allocation module assigning tasks to expert agents using a model zoo of patch and WSI level MLLMs, (2) a verification mechanism ensuring accuracy through internal consistency checks and external validation using pathology knowledge bases and domain-specific models, and (3) a summary module synthesizing the final summary with visual interpretation maps. Extensive experiments on multi-modal WSI benchmarks show WSI-Agents's superiority to current WSI MLLMs and medical agent frameworks across diverse tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting DeepFakes has become a crucial research area as the widespread use of AI image generators enables the effortless creation of face-manipulated and fully synthetic content, yet existing methods are often limited to binary classification (real vs. fake) and lack interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose TruthLens, a novel and highly generalizable framework for DeepFake detection that not only determines whether an image is real or fake but also provides detailed textual reasoning for its predictions. Unlike traditional methods, TruthLens effectively handles both face-manipulated DeepFakes and fully AI-generated content while addressing fine-grained queries such as "Does the eyes/nose/mouth look real or fake?"The architecture of TruthLens combines the global contextual understanding of multimodal large language models like PaliGemma2 with the localized feature extraction capabilities of vision-only models like DINOv2. This hybrid design leverages the complementary strengths of both models, enabling robust detection of subtle manipulations while maintaining interpretability. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that TruthLens outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy (by 2-14%) and explainability, in both in-domain and cross-data settings, generalizing effectively across traditional and emerging manipulation techniques.

  _Yijing Lin, Mengqi Huang, Shuhan Zhuang, Zhendong Mao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unifying diverse image generation tasks within a single framework remains a fundamental challenge in visual generation. While large language models (LLMs) achieve unification through task-agnostic data and generation, existing visual generation models fail to meet these principles. Current approaches either rely on per-task datasets and large-scale training or adapt pre-trained image models with task-specific modifications, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we explore video models as a foundation for unified image generation, leveraging their inherent ability to model temporal correlations. We introduce RealGeneral, a novel framework that reformulates image generation as a conditional frame prediction task, analogous to in-context learning in LLMs. To bridge the gap between video models and condition-image pairs, we propose (1) a Unified Conditional Embedding module for multi-modal alignment and (2) a Unified Stream DiT Block with decoupled adaptive LayerNorm and attention mask to mitigate cross-modal interference. RealGeneral demonstrates effectiveness in multiple important visual generation tasks, e.g., it achieves a 14.5% improvement in subject similarity for customized generation and a 10% enhancement in image quality for canny-to-image task.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), grounding and referring capabilities have gained increasing attention for achieving detailed understanding and flexible user interaction. However, these capabilities still remain underdeveloped in visual document understanding due to the scarcity of fine-grained datasets and comprehensive benchmarks. To fill this gap, we propose the DOcument Grounding and Referring data engine (DOGR-Engine), which generates two types of high-quality fine-grained document data: (1) multi-granular parsing data to improve text localization and recognition, and (2) instruction-tuning data to activate MLLMs' grounding and referring capabilities in dialogue and reasoning. Using the DOGR-Engine, we construct DOGR-Bench, a benchmark covering seven grounding and referring tasks across three document types (chart, poster, and PDF document), offering a comprehensive evaluation of fine-grained document understanding. Leveraging the generated data, we further develop DOGR, a strong baseline model that excels in text localization and recognition, while precisely grounds and refers to key textual information during conversation and reasoning, thereby advancing document understanding to a finer granularity and enable flexible interaction paradigms.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating detailed descriptions from multiple cameras and viewpoints is challenging due to the complex and inconsistent nature of visual data. In this paper, we introduce PerspectiveNet, a lightweight yet efficient model for generating long descriptions across multiple camera views. Our approach utilizes a vision encoder, a compact connector module to convert visual features into a fixed-size tensor, and large language models (LLMs) to harness the strong natural language generation capabilities of LLMs. The connector module is designed with three main goals: mapping visual features onto LLM embeddings, emphasizing key information needed for description generation, and producing a fixed-size feature matrix. Additionally, we augment our solution with a secondary task, the correct frame sequence detection, enabling the model to search for the correct sequence of frames to generate descriptions. Finally, we integrate the connector module, the secondary task, the LLM, and a visual feature extraction model into a single architecture, which is trained for the Traffic Safety Description and Analysis task. This task requires generating detailed, fine-grained descriptions of events from multiple cameras and viewpoints. The resulting model is lightweight, ensuring efficient training and inference, while remaining highly effective.

  _Haoran Zhou, Zihan Zhang, Hao Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides by combining visual recognition and language understanding to generate content that is both coherent and contextually accurate. However, MLLMs continue to struggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible but factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the image. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly suppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs. However, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer stage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and the differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability distributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers. Motivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a simple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with the most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output distributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and pure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally incorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly, EVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding strategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on widely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces hallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, the introduction of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into video understanding tasks has become increasingly prevalent. However, how to effectively integrate temporal information remains a critical research focus. Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information separately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately represent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to temporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature extraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and video understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video representation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce a set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas containing fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature extraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the fine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to maintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video Rotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency of DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this combined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video understanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in enhancing video comprehension.

  _Qinqian Lei, Bo Wang, Robby T. Tan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-shot human-object interaction (HOI) detection remains a challenging task, particularly in generalizing to unseen actions. Existing methods address this challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge beyond the training data. However, they either struggle to distinguish actions involving the same object or demonstrate limited generalization to unseen classes. In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with Low-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both enhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In training, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank factorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights. These features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves shared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes. Subsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI class and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction representations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight adaptation with LLM-derived action regularization. Experimental results show that our method sets a new state-of-the-art across zero-shot HOI settings on HICO-DET, achieving an unseen-class mAP of 27.91 in the unseen-verb setting.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In light of recent breakthroughs in text-to-image (T2I) generation, particularly with diffusion transformers (DiT), subject-driven technologies are increasingly being employed for high-fidelity customized production that preserves subject identity from reference inputs, enabling thrilling design workflows and engaging entertainment. Existing alternatives typically require either per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training specialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets. Such dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their practical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully leverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers (e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this gap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates DiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal attention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while preserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis of DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly improves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic representations. Extensive experiments reflect that our method successfully unlocks DiT's zero-shot ability for consistent subject synthesis across diverse contexts, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable results compared to approaches that require additional training. Notably, our framework demonstrates seamless compatibility with existing inpainting pipelines and control modules, facilitating more compelling experiences. Our code is available at:this https URL.

  Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) aims to predict a sequence of user actions required to achieve a specified goal based on a video showing the user's progress. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising results in video understanding, long-horizon visual planning remains a challenging problem. We identify two challenges in training large MLLMs for video-based planning tasks: (1) scarcity of procedural annotations, limiting the model's ability to learn procedural task dynamics effectively, and (2) inefficiency of next-token prediction objective to explicitly capture the structured action space for visual planning when compared to free-form, natural language. To tackle data scarcity, we introduce Auxiliary Task Augmentation. We design and train our model on auxiliary tasks relevant to long-horizon video-based planning (e.g., goal prediction) to augment the model's planning ability. To more explicitly model the structured action space unique to visual planning tasks, we leverage Multi-token Prediction, extending traditional next-token prediction by using multiple heads to predict multiple future tokens during training. Our approach, VideoPlan, achieves state-of-the-art VPA performance on the COIN and CrossTask datasets, surpassing prior methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively, when predicting 3 future actions. We further extend our method to the challenging Ego4D Long-term Action Anticipation task, and show that it is on par with the state-of-the-art approaches despite not using specialized egocentric features. Code will be made available.

  Text image is a unique and crucial information medium that integrates visual aesthetics and linguistic semantics in modern e-society. Due to their subtlety and complexity, the generation of text images represents a challenging and evolving frontier in the image generation field. The recent surge of specialized image generators (\emph{e.g.}, Flux-series) and unified generative models (\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4o), which demonstrate exceptional fidelity, raises a natural question: can they master the intricacies of text image generation and editing? Motivated by this, we assess current state-of-the-art generative models' capabilities in terms of text image generation and editing. We incorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our evaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR generative tasks. We select 33 representative tasks and categorize them into five categories: document, handwritten text, scene text, artistic text, and complex \& layout-rich text. For comprehensive evaluation, we examine six models across both closed-source and open-source domains, using tailored, high-quality image inputs and prompts. Through this evaluation, we draw crucial observations and identify the weaknesses of current generative models for OCR tasks. We argue that photorealistic text image generation and editing should be internalized as foundational skills into general-domain generative models, rather than being delegated to specialized solutions, and we hope this empirical analysis can provide valuable insights for the community to achieve this goal. This evaluation is online and will be continuously updated at our GitHub repository.

  Human intelligence requires correctness and robustness, with the former being foundational for the latter. In video understanding, correctness ensures the accurate interpretation of visual content, and robustness maintains consistent performance in challenging conditions. Despite advances in video large language models (video LLMs), existing benchmarks inadequately reflect the gap between these models and human intelligence in maintaining correctness and robustness in video interpretation. We introduce the Video Thinking Test (Video-TT), to assess if video LLMs can interpret real-world videos as effectively as humans. Video-TT reflects genuine gaps in understanding complex visual narratives, and evaluates robustness against natural adversarial questions. Video-TT comprises 1,000 YouTube Shorts videos, each with one open-ended question and four adversarial questions that probe visual and narrative complexity. Our evaluation shows a significant gap between video LLMs and human performance.

  Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot abilities but struggle with complex Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR) and are resource-intensive for edge device deployment. Meanwhile, conventional GSR models often lack generalization ability, falling short in recognizing unseen and rare situations. In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a teacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot abilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation Recognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt Distillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal knowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to recognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations. Specifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental Rationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze rationales enriched with contextual semantic information. The proposed scene-aware and instance-perception prompts are then introduced to align rationales with visual information from the MLLM teacher via the Negative-Guided Multimodal Prompting Alignment (NMPA) module, effectively capturing holistic and perceptual multimodal knowledge. Finally, the aligned multimodal knowledge is distilled into the student Ov-GSR model, providing a stronger foundation for generalization that enhances situation understanding, bridges the gap between seen and unseen scenarios, and mitigates prediction bias in rare cases. We evaluate MIPD on the refined Ov-SWiG dataset, achieving superior performance on seen, rare, and unseen situations, and further demonstrate improved unseen detection on the HICO-DET dataset.

  Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved image and video synthesis capabilities, significantly increasing the risk of misinformation through sophisticated fake content. In response, detection methods have evolved from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately, making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning (RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

  Understanding 3D scenes goes beyond simply recognizing objects; it requires reasoning about the spatial and semantic relationships between them. Current 3D scene-language models often struggle with this relational understanding, particularly when visual embeddings alone do not adequately convey the roles and interactions of objects. In this paper, we introduce Descrip3D, a novel and powerful framework that explicitly encodes the relationships between objects using natural language. Unlike previous methods that rely only on 2D and 3D embeddings, Descrip3D enhances each object with a textual description that captures both its intrinsic attributes and contextual relationships. These relational cues are incorporated into the model through a dual-level integration: embedding fusion and prompt-level injection. This allows for unified reasoning across various tasks such as grounding, captioning, and question answering, all without the need for task-specific heads or additional supervision. When evaluated on five benchmark datasets, including ScanRefer, Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, SQA3D, and Scan2Cap, Descrip3D consistently outperforms strong baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of language-guided relational representation for understanding complex indoor scenes.

  Real-world infrared imagery presents unique challenges for vision-language models due to the scarcity of aligned text data and domain-specific characteristics. Although existing methods have advanced the field, their reliance on synthetic infrared images generated through style transfer from visible images, which limits their ability to capture the unique characteristics of the infrared modality. To address this, we propose IRGPT, the first multi-modal large language model for real-world infrared images, built upon a large-scale InfraRed-Text Dataset (IR-TD) comprising over 260K authentic image-text pairs. The proposed IR-TD dataset contains real infrared images paired with meticulously handcrafted texts, where the initial drafts originated from two complementary processes: (1) LLM-generated descriptions of visible images, and (2) rule-based descriptions of annotations. Furthermore, we introduce a bi-cross-modal curriculum transfer learning strategy that systematically transfers knowledge from visible to infrared domains by considering the difficulty scores of both infrared-visible and infrared-text. Evaluated on a benchmark of 9 tasks (e.g., recognition, grounding), IRGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance even compared with larger-scale models.

  Generative super-resolution (GSR) currently sets the state-of-the-art in terms of perceptual image quality, overcoming the "regression-to-the-mean" blur of prior non-generative models. However, from a human perspective, such models do not fully conform to the optimal balance between quality and fidelity. Instead, a different class of artifacts, in which generated details fail to perceptually match the low resolution image (LRI) or ground-truth image (GTI), is a critical but under studied issue in GSR, limiting its practical deployments. In this work, we focus on measuring, analyzing, and mitigating these artifacts (i.e., "hallucinations"). We observe that hallucinations are not well-characterized with existing image metrics or quality models, as they are orthogonal to both exact fidelity and no-reference quality. Instead, we take advantage of a multimodal large language model (MLLM) by constructing a prompt that assesses hallucinatory visual elements and generates a "Hallucination Score" (HS). We find that our HS is closely aligned with human evaluations, and also provides complementary insights to prior image metrics used for super-resolution (SR) models. In addition, we find certain deep feature distances have strong correlations with HS. We therefore propose to align the GSR models by using such features as differentiable reward functions to mitigate hallucinations.

  While recent advances in image editing have enabled impressive visual synthesis capabilities, current methods remain constrained by explicit textual instructions and limited editing operations, lacking deep comprehension of implicit user intentions and contextual reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new image editing paradigm: reasoning-guided generative editing, which synthesizes images based on complex, multi-faceted textual queries accepting world knowledge and intention inference. To facilitate this task, we first construct a comprehensive dataset featuring over 1,000 image-instruction-edit triples that incorporate rich reasoning contexts and real-world knowledge. We then propose R-Genie: a reasoning-guided generative image editor, which synergizes the generation power of diffusion models with advanced reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models. R-Genie incorporates a reasoning-attention mechanism to bridge linguistic understanding with visual synthesis, enabling it to handle intricate editing requests involving abstract user intentions and contextual reasoning relations. Extensive experimental results validate that R-Genie can equip diffusion models with advanced reasoning-based editing capabilities, unlocking new potentials for intelligent image synthesis.

  Foundation models trained on vast amounts of data have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generation capabilities in the domains of text, images, audio and video. Our goal at Roblox is to build such a foundation model for 3D intelligence, a model that can support developers in producing all aspects of a Roblox experience, from generating 3D objects and scenes to rigging characters for animation to producing programmatic scripts describing object behaviors. We discuss three key design requirements for such a 3D foundation model and then present our first step towards building such a model. We expect that 3D geometric shapes will be a core data type and describe our solution for 3D shape tokenizer. We show how our tokenization scheme can be used in applications for text-to-shape generation, shape-to-text generation and text-to-scene generation. We demonstrate how these applications can collaborate with existing large language models (LLMs) to perform scene analysis and reasoning. We conclude with a discussion outlining our path to building a fully unified foundation model for 3D intelligence.

In particular, it first divides the input video into short-term clips, which are jointly encoded with their timestamps and fused across overlapping temporal windows into time-sensitive local features. Next, the local features are passed through a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) module for global feature aggregation. The extracted time-aware and multi-level features are important for accurate temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding in long videos. Moreover, to facilitate the evaluation of TemporalVLM, we present a large-scale long video dataset of industry assembly processes, namely IndustryASM, which consists of videos recorded on factory floors with actions and timestamps annotated by industrial engineers for time and motion studies and temporal action segmentation evaluation. Finally, extensive experiments on datasets of long videos, including TimeIT and IndustryASM, show that TemporalVLM achieves superior performance than previous methods across temporal reasoning and fine-grained understanding tasks, namely dense video captioning, temporal video grounding, video highlight detection, and temporal action segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to incorporate LSTMs into video LLMs.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in cross-modality interaction, yet they also suffer adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, the transferability of adversarial examples remains an ongoing challenge. In this paper, we specifically analyze the manifestation of adversarial transferability among MLLMs and identify the key factors that influence this characteristic. We discover that the transferability of MLLMs exists in cross-LLM scenarios with the same vision encoder and indicate \underline{\textit{two key Factors}} that may influence transferability. We provide two semantic-level data augmentation methods, Adding Image Patch (AIP) and Typography Augment Transferability Method (TATM), which boost the transferability of adversarial examples across MLLMs. To explore the potential impact in the real world, we utilize two tasks that can have both negative and positive societal impacts: \ding{182} Harmful Content Insertion and \ding{183} Information Protection.

  Scalable annotation approaches are crucial for constructing extensive 3D-text datasets, facilitating a broader range of applications. However, existing methods sometimes lead to the generation of hallucinated captions, compromising caption quality. This paper explores the issue of hallucination in 3D object captioning, with a focus on Cap3D method, which renders 3D objects into 2D views for captioning using pre-trained models. We pinpoint a major challenge: certain rendered views of 3D objects are atypical, deviating from the training data of standard image captioning models and causing hallucinations. To tackle this, we present DiffuRank, a method that leverages a pre-trained text-to-3D model to assess the alignment between 3D objects and their 2D rendered views, where the view with high alignment closely represent the object's characteristics. By ranking all rendered views and feeding the top-ranked ones into GPT4-Vision, we enhance the accuracy and detail of captions, enabling the correction of 200k captions in the Cap3D dataset and extending it to 1 million captions across Objaverse and Objaverse-XL datasets. Additionally, we showcase the adaptability of DiffuRank by applying it to pre-trained text-to-image models for a Visual Question Answering task, where it outperforms the CLIP model.

  Modern moderation systems increasingly support multiple languages, but often fail to address localisation and low-resource variants - creating safety gaps in real-world deployments. Small models offer a potential alternative to large LLMs, yet still demand considerable data and compute. We present LionGuard 2, a lightweight, multilingual moderation classifier tailored to the Singapore context, supporting English, Chinese, Malay, and partial Tamil. Built on pre-trained OpenAI embeddings and a multi-head ordinal classifier, LionGuard 2 outperforms several commercial and open-source systems across 17 benchmarks, including both Singapore-specific and public English datasets. The system is actively deployed within the Singapore Government, demonstrating practical efficacy at scale. Our findings show that high-quality local data and robust multilingual embeddings can achieve strong moderation performance, without fine-tuning large models. We release our model weights and part of our training data to support future work on LLM safety.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate a performance gap between English and non-English languages, particularly in low-resource settings. Aligning these models to low-resource languages is essential yet challenging due to limited high-quality data. While English alignment datasets are readily available, curating equivalent data in other languages is expensive and time-consuming. A common workaround is to translate existing English alignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve critical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured formats like JSON. In this work, we investigate LLM-based selective translation, a technique that selectively translates only the translatable parts of a text while preserving non-translatable content and sentence structure. We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this approach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the importance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated samples with original English data during alignment. Our experiments focus on the low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by Google Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B. The results highlight the promise of selective translation as a practical and effective method for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic architectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase, due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value (KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory, forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant improvements on associative recall tasks.

  Large language models (LLMs) turn writing into a live exchange between humans and software. We characterize this new medium as a discursive network that treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements circulate. We define the generation of erroneous information as invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external detection. We develop a general mathematical model of discursive networks that shows that a network governed only by drift and self-repair stabilizes at a modest error rate. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer review with the open-source Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm: a configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a harmonizer merges their verdicts. We identify an ethical transgression, epithesis, that occurs when humans fail to engage in the discursive network. The takeaway is practical and cultural: reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from connecting imperfect ones into networks that enforce mutual accountability.

  Proficient multilingual speakers often intentionally switch languages in the middle of a conversation. Similarly, recent reasoning-focused bilingual large language models (LLMs) with strong capabilities in both languages exhibit language mixing--alternating languages within their chain of thought. Discouraging this behavior in DeepSeek-R1 was found to degrade accuracy, suggesting that language mixing may benefit reasoning. In this work, we study language switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training stage that leads to language mixing. We demonstrate that language mixing can enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6 percentage points on math reasoning tasks. Additionally, a lightweight probe can be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or harm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by up to 6.25 percentage points. Our findings suggest that language mixing is not merely a byproduct of multilingual training, but is a strategic reasoning behavior.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Process Reward Models (PRMs) play a central role in evaluating and guiding multi-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs), especially for mathematical problem solving. However, we identify a pervasive length bias in existing PRMs: they tend to assign higher scores to longer reasoning steps, even when the semantic content and logical validity are unchanged. This bias undermines the reliability of reward predictions and leads to overly verbose outputs during inference. To address this issue, we propose CoLD(Counterfactually-Guided Length Debiasing), a unified framework that mitigates length bias through three components: an explicit length-penalty adjustment, a learned bias estimator trained to capture spurious length-related signals, and a joint training strategy that enforces length-invariance in reward predictions. Our approach is grounded in counterfactual reasoning and informed by causal graph analysis. Extensive experiments on MATH500 and GSM-Plus show that CoLD consistently reduces reward-length correlation, improves accuracy in step selection, and encourages more concise, logically valid reasoning. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of CoLD in improving the fidelity and robustness of PRMs.

  This work evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to power digital assistants capable of complex action execution. These assistants rely on pre-trained programming knowledge to execute multi-step goals by composing objects and functions defined in assistant libraries into action execution programs. To achieve this, we develop ASPERA, a framework comprising an assistant library simulation and a human-assisted LLM data generation engine. Our engine allows developers to guide LLM generation of high-quality tasks consisting of complex user queries, simulation state and corresponding validation programs, tackling data availability and evaluation robustness challenges. Alongside the framework we release Asper-Bench, an evaluation dataset of 250 challenging tasks generated using ASPERA, which we use to show that program generation grounded in custom assistant libraries is a significant challenge to LLMs compared to dependency-free code generation.

  Automating data extraction from full-text randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for meta-analysis remains a significant challenge. This study evaluates the practical performance of three LLMs (Gemini-2.0-flash, Grok-3, GPT-4o-mini) across tasks involving statistical results, risk-of-bias assessments, and study-level characteristics in three medical domains: hypertension, diabetes, and orthopaedics. We tested four distinct prompting strategies (basic prompting, self-reflective prompting, model ensemble, and customised prompts) to determine how to improve extraction quality. All models demonstrate high precision but consistently suffer from poor recall by omitting key information. We found that customised prompts were the most effective, boosting recall by up to 15\%. Based on this analysis, we propose a three-tiered set of guidelines for using LLMs in data extraction, matching data types to appropriate levels of automation based on task complexity and risk. Our study offers practical advice for automating data extraction in real-world meta-analyses, balancing LLM efficiency with expert oversight through targeted, task-specific automation.

  Post-training has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with human instructions, significantly enhancing their performance across a wide range of tasks. Central to this process is the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. This paper presents a review of publicly available Arabic post-training datasets on the Hugging Face Hub, organized along four key dimensions: (1) LLM Capabilities (e.g., Question Answering, Translation, Reasoning, Summarization, Dialogue, Code Generation, and Function Calling); (2) Steerability (e.g., persona and system prompts); (3) Alignment (e.g., cultural, safety, ethics, and fairness), and (4) Robustness. Each dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption, recency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing transparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in the development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task diversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low adoption across the community. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of these gaps on the progress of Arabic LLMs and applications while providing concrete recommendations for future efforts in post-training dataset development.

  This paper aims to demonstrate the potential and strengths of open-source collectives. It leads to a promising question: Can we harness multiple open-source LLMs to match or even beat the closed-source LLMs? To answer this, we propose SMACS, a scalable multi-agent collaboration system (MACS) framework with high performance. Specifically, for continuous integration of new LLMs and generalization to diverse questions, we first propose a Retrieval-based Prior Selection (RPS), which assigns a proxy performance score to each LLM to select the Top-k LLMs at the instance level for any given question. Then, we propose an Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE), encouraging the generation of diverse responses through prior dropping and selecting the high-quality response via a hybrid posterior score. Experiments on eight mainstream benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our SMACS: by integrating fifteen open-source LLMs, SMACS outperforms leading closed-source LLMs in 2025, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet (+12.73%), GPT-4.1(+5.36%) and GPT-o3-mini(+5.28%) across multiple tasks. Remarkably, it even exceeds the average of best results of different datasets from both open-source LLMs (+2.86%) and closed-source LLMs (+2.04%), pushing the upper bound of intelligence.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scientists often infer abstract procedures from specific instances of problems and use the abstractions to generate new, related instances. For example, programs encoding the formal rules and properties of a system have been useful in fields ranging from reinforcement learning (procedural environments) to physics (simulation engines). These programs can be seen as functions which execute to different outputs based on their parameterizations (e.g., gridworld configuration or initial physical conditions). We introduce the term EFA (Executable Functional Abstraction) to denote such programs for math problems. EFA-like constructs have been shown to be useful for mathematical reasoning as problem generators for stress-testing models. However, prior work has been limited to automatically constructing abstractions for grade-school math (whose simple rules are easy to encode in programs), while generating EFAs for advanced math has thus far required human engineering. We explore the automatic construction of EFAs for advanced mathematics problems by developing EFAGen, which operationalizes the task of automatically inferring an EFA for a given seed problem and solution as a program synthesis task. We first formalize the properties of any valid EFA as executable unit tests. Using execution feedback from the unit tests, we search over candidate programs sampled from a LLM to find EFA programs that are faithful to the generalized problem and solution class underlying the seed problem. We then apply the tests as a reward signal, training LLMs to become better writers of EFAs. We show that EFAs inferred by EFAGen are faithful to the seed problems, produce learnable problem variations, and that EFAGen can infer EFAs across diverse sources of competition-level math problems. Finally, we show uses of model-written EFAs e.g., finding harder/easier problem variants, as well as data generation.

  Training effective AI agents for multi-turn interactions requires high-quality data that captures realistic human-agent dynamics, yet such data is scarce and expensive to collect manually. We introduce APIGen-MT, a two-phase framework that generates verifiable and diverse multi-turn agent data. In the first phase, our agentic pipeline produces detailed task blueprints with ground-truth actions, leveraging a committee of LLM reviewers and iterative feedback loops. These blueprints are then transformed into complete interaction trajectories through simulated human-agent interplay. We train a family of models -- the xLAM-2-fc-r series with sizes ranging from 1B to 70B parameters. Our models outperform frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 on $\tau$-bench and BFCL benchmarks, with the smaller models surpassing their larger counterparts, particularly in multi-turn settings, while maintaining superior consistency across multiple trials. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our verified blueprint-to-details approach yields high-quality training data, enabling the development of more reliable, efficient, and capable agents. We open-source 5K synthetic data trajectories and the trained xLAM-2-fc-r models to advance research in AI agents.Models atthis https URLDataset atthis https URLand Website atthis https URL

  Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains underdiagnosed in clinical settings, presenting opportunities for automated detection to identify patients. This study evaluates natural language processing approaches for detecting PTSD from clinical interview transcripts. We compared general and mental health-specific transformer models (BERT/RoBERTa), embedding-based methods (SentenceBERT/LLaMA), and large language model prompting strategies (zero-shot/few-shot/chain-of-thought) using the DAIC-WOZ dataset. Domain-specific end-to-end models significantly outperformed general models (Mental-RoBERTa AUPRC=0.675+/-0.084 vs. RoBERTa-base 0.599+/-0.145). SentenceBERT embeddings with neural networks achieved the highest overall performance (AUPRC=0.758+/-0.128). Few-shot prompting using DSM-5 criteria yielded competitive results with two examples (AUPRC=0.737). Performance varied significantly across symptom severity and comorbidity status with depression, with higher accuracy for severe PTSD cases and patients with comorbid depression. Our findings highlight the potential of domain-adapted embeddings and LLMs for scalable screening while underscoring the need for improved detection of nuanced presentations and offering insights for developing clinically viable AI tools for PTSD assessment.

  Intent, typically clearly formulated and planned, functions as a cognitive framework for communication and problem-solving. This paper introduces the concept of Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the explicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and provides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and action. By emulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is hypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of LLMs. Extensive experiments on text summarization, multi-task question answering, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of Speaking with Intent over direct generation without explicit intent. Further analysis corroborates the generalizability of SWI under different experimental settings. Moreover, human evaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the intent produced by SWI. The promising results in enhancing LLMs with explicit intents pave a new avenue for boosting LLMs' generation and reasoning abilities with cognitive notions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Combining existing pre-trained expert LLMs is a promising avenue for scalably tackling large-scale and diverse tasks. However, selecting task-level experts is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise per instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we show that Symbolic-MoE beats strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute avg. gain of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE generalizes well to unseen tasks and removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.

  The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in customer support is constrained by hallucination (generating false information) and the high cost of proprietary models. To address these challenges, we propose a retrieval-augmented question-answering (QA) pipeline and explore how to balance human input and automation. Using a dataset of questions about a Samsung Smart TV user manual, we demonstrate that synthetic data generated by LLMs outperforms crowdsourced data in reducing hallucination in finetuned models. We also compare self-training (fine-tuning models on their own outputs) and knowledge distillation (fine-tuning on stronger models' outputs, e.g., GPT-4o), and find that self-training achieves comparable hallucination reduction. We conjecture that this surprising finding can be attributed to increased exposure bias issues in the knowledge distillation case and support this conjecture with post hoc analysis. We also improve robustness to unanswerable questions and retrieval failures with contextualized "I don't know" responses. These findings show that scalable, cost-efficient QA systems can be built using synthetic data and self-training with open-source models, reducing reliance on proprietary tools or costly human annotations.

  Aligned representations across languages is a desired property in multilingual large language models (mLLMs), as alignment can improve performance in cross-lingual tasks. Typically alignment requires fine-tuning a model, which is computationally expensive, and sizable language data, which often may not be available. A data-efficient alternative to fine-tuning is model interventions -- a method for manipulating model activations to steer generation into the desired direction. We analyze the effect of a popular intervention (finding experts) on the alignment of cross-lingual representations in mLLMs. We identify the neurons to manipulate for a given language and introspect the embedding space of mLLMs pre- and post-manipulation. We show that modifying the mLLM's activations changes its embedding space such that cross-lingual alignment is enhanced. Further, we show that the changes to the embedding space translate into improved downstream performance on retrieval tasks, with up to 2x improvements in top-1 accuracy on cross-lingual retrieval.

  This study explores how large language models (LLMs) encode interwoven scientific knowledge, using chemical elements and LLaMA-series models as a case study. We identify a 3D spiral structure in the hidden states that aligns with the conceptual structure of the periodic table, suggesting that LLMs can reflect the geometric organization of scientific concepts learned from text. Linear probing reveals that middle layers encode continuous, overlapping attributes that enable indirect recall, while deeper layers sharpen categorical distinctions and incorporate linguistic context. These findings suggest that LLMs represent symbolic knowledge not as isolated facts, but as structured geometric manifolds that intertwine semantic information across layers. We hope this work inspires further exploration of how LLMs represent and reason about scientific knowledge, particularly in domains such as materials science.

As a complex cognitive-linguistic phenomenon, they provide a valuable means to evaluate whether language models can capture deeper aspects of meaning, including semantic, pragmatic, and cultural context. In this work, we present Meta4XNLI, the first parallel dataset for Natural Language Inference (NLI) newly annotated for metaphor detection and interpretation in both English and Spanish. Meta4XNLI facilitates the comparison of encoder- and decoder-based models in detecting and understanding metaphorical language in multilingual and cross-lingual settings. Our results show that fine-tuned encoders outperform decoders-only LLMs in metaphor detection. Metaphor interpretation is evaluated via the NLI framework with comparable performance of masked and autoregressive models, which notably decreases when the inference is affected by metaphorical language. Our study also finds that translation plays an important role in the preservation or loss of metaphors across languages, introducing shifts that might impact metaphor occurrence and model performance. These findings underscore the importance of resources like Meta4XNLI for advancing the analysis of the capabilities of language models and improving our understanding of metaphor processing across languages. Furthermore, the dataset offers previously unavailable opportunities to investigate metaphor interpretation, cross-lingual metaphor transferability, and the impact of translation on the development of multilingual annotated resources.

  Collecting human-chatbot dialogues typically demands substantial manual effort and is time-consuming, which limits and poses challenges for research on conversational AI. In this work, we propose DialogueForge - a framework for generating AI-simulated conversations in human-chatbot style. To initialize each generated conversation, DialogueForge uses seed prompts extracted from real human-chatbot interactions. We test a variety of LLMs to simulate the human chatbot user, ranging from state-of-the-art proprietary models to small-scale open-source LLMs, and generate multi-turn dialogues tailored to specific tasks. In addition, we explore fine-tuning techniques to enhance the ability of smaller models to produce indistinguishable human-like dialogues. We evaluate the quality of the simulated conversations and compare different models using the UniEval and GTEval evaluation protocols. Our experiments show that large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) generally outperform others in generating more realistic dialogues, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Llama, Mistral) offer promising performance with greater customization. We demonstrate that the performance of smaller models can be significantly improved by employing supervised fine-tuning techniques. Nevertheless, maintaining coherent and natural long-form human-like dialogues remains a common challenge across all models.

  Current benchmarks evaluating large language models (LLMs) in ophthalmology are limited in scope and disproportionately prioritise accuracy. We introduce BELO (BEnchmarking LLMs for Ophthalmology), a standardized and comprehensive evaluation benchmark developed through multiple rounds of expert checking by 13 ophthalmologists. BELO assesses ophthalmology-related clinical accuracy and reasoning quality. Using keyword matching and a fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, we curated ophthalmology-specific multiple-choice-questions (MCQs) from diverse medical datasets (BCSC, MedMCQA, MedQA, BioASQ, and PubMedQA). The dataset underwent multiple rounds of expert checking. Duplicate and substandard questions were systematically removed. Ten ophthalmologists refined the explanations of each MCQ's correct answer. This was further adjudicated by three senior ophthalmologists. To illustrate BELO's utility, we evaluated six LLMs (OpenAI o1, o3-mini, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-3-8B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) using accuracy, macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, BERTScore, BARTScore, METEOR, and AlignScore). In a further evaluation involving human experts, two ophthalmologists qualitatively reviewed 50 randomly selected outputs for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and completeness. BELO consists of 900 high-quality, expert-reviewed questions aggregated from five sources: BCSC (260), BioASQ (10), MedMCQA (572), MedQA (40), and PubMedQA (18). A public leaderboard has been established to promote transparent evaluation and reporting. Importantly, the BELO dataset will remain a hold-out, evaluation-only benchmark to ensure fair and reproducible comparisons of future models.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been evaluated using diverse question types, e.g., multiple-choice, true/false, and short/long answers. This study answers an unexplored question about the impact of different question types on LLM accuracy on reasoning tasks. We investigate the performance of five LLMs on three different types of questions using quantitative and deductive reasoning tasks. The performance metrics include accuracy in the reasoning steps and choosing the final answer. Key Findings: (1) Significant differences exist in LLM performance across different question types. (2) Reasoning accuracy does not necessarily correlate with the final selection accuracy. (3) The number of options and the choice of words, influence LLM performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in metaphor interpretation across multiple datasets, tasks, and prompt configurations. Although metaphor processing has gained significant attention in Natural Language Processing (NLP), previous research has been limited to single-dataset evaluations and specific task settings, often using artificially constructed data through lexical replacement. We address these limitations by conducting extensive experiments using diverse publicly available datasets with inference and metaphor annotations, focusing on Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Question Answering (QA) tasks. The results indicate that LLMs' performance is more influenced by features like lexical overlap and sentence length than by metaphorical content, demonstrating that any alleged emergent abilities of LLMs to understand metaphorical language are the result of a combination of surface-level features, in-context learning, and linguistic knowledge. This work provides critical insights into the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in processing figurative language, highlighting the need for more realistic evaluation frameworks in metaphor interpretation tasks. Data and code are publicly available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are limited to some extent by pre-training, so some researchers optimize LLMs through post-training. Existing post-training strategies, such as memory-based retrieval or preference optimization, improve user alignment yet fail to enhance the model's domain cognition. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Dual-Phase Self-Evolution (DPSE) framework that jointly optimizes user preference adaptation and domain-specific competence. DPSE introduces a Censor module to extract multi-dimensional interaction signals and estimate satisfaction scores, which guide structured data expansion via topic-aware and preference-driven strategies. These expanded datasets support a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline: supervised domain grounding followed by frequency-aware preference optimization. Experiments across general NLP benchmarks and long-term dialogue tasks demonstrate that DPSE consistently outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning, Preference Optimization, and Memory-Augmented baselines. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each module. In this way, our framework provides an autonomous path toward continual self-evolution of LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining the semantic entailment of a premise for a given hypothesis. The task aims to develop systems that emulate natural human inferential processes where commonsense knowledge plays a major role. However, existing commonsense resources lack sufficient coverage for a variety of premise-hypothesis pairs. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models as commonsense knowledge generators for NLI along two key dimensions: their reliability in generating such knowledge and the impact of that knowledge on prediction accuracy. We adapt and modify existing metrics to assess LLM factuality and consistency in generating in this context. While explicitly incorporating commonsense knowledge does not consistently improve overall results, it effectively helps distinguish entailing instances and moderately improves distinguishing contradictory and neutral inferences.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advent of Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents has revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling solutions to complex, open-ended tasks through web-based information-seeking (IS) capabilities. The scarcity of high-quality training data has limited the development of IS agents. Existing approaches typically adopt an information-driven paradigm that first collects web data and then generates questions based on the retrieval. However, this may lead to inconsistency between information structure and reasoning structure, question and answer. To mitigate, we propose a formalization-driven IS data synthesis framework WebShaper to construct a dataset. WebShaper systematically formalizes IS tasks through set theory. Central to the formalization is the concept of Knowledge Projections (KP), which enables precise control over reasoning structure by KP operation compositions. During synthesis, we begin by creating seed tasks, then use a multi-step expansion process. At each step, an agentic Expander expands the current formal question more complex with retrieval and validation tools based on our formalization. We train our model on the synthesized dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that WebShaper achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-sourced IS agents on GAIA and WebWalkerQA benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) across various NLP tasks, hallucinations in LLMs--where LLMs generate inaccurate responses--remains as a critical problem as it can be directly connected to a crisis of building safe and reliable LLMs. Uncertainty estimation is primarily used to measure hallucination levels in LLM responses so that correct and incorrect answers can be distinguished clearly. This study proposes an effective uncertainty estimation approach, \textbf{Cl}ust\textbf{e}ring-based sem\textbf{an}tic con\textbf{s}ist\textbf{e}ncy (\textbf{Cleanse}). Cleanse quantifies the uncertainty with the proportion of the intra-cluster consistency in the total consistency between LLM hidden embeddings which contain adequate semantic information of generations, by employing clustering. The effectiveness of Cleanse for detecting hallucination is validated using four off-the-shelf models, LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, LLaMA2-7B and Mistral-7B and two question-answering benchmarks, SQuAD and CoQA.

  Large Language Models(LLMs) hold promise for improving healthcare access in low-resource settings, but their effectiveness in African primary care remains underexplored. We present a methodology for creating a benchmark dataset and evaluation framework focused on Kenyan Level 2 and 3 clinical care. Our approach uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to ground clinical questions in Kenya's national guidelines, ensuring alignment with local standards. These guidelines were digitized, chunked, and indexed for semantic retrieval. Gemini Flash 2.0 Lite was then prompted with guideline excerpts to generate realistic clinical scenarios, multiple-choice questions, and rationale based answers in English and Swahili. Kenyan physicians co-created and refined the dataset, and a blinded expert review process ensured clinical accuracy, clarity, and cultural appropriateness. The resulting Alama Health QA dataset includes thousands of regulator-aligned question answer pairs across common outpatient conditions. Beyond accuracy, we introduce evaluation metrics that test clinical reasoning, safety, and adaptability such as rare case detection (Needle in the Haystack), stepwise logic (Decision Points), and contextual adaptability. Initial results reveal significant performance gaps when LLMs are applied to localized scenarios, consistent with findings that LLM accuracy is lower on African medical content than on US-based benchmarks. This work offers a replicable model for guideline-driven, dynamic benchmarking to support safe AI deployment in African health systems.

  Numerous domain-specific machine learning tasks struggle with data scarcity and class imbalance. This paper systematically explores data augmentation methods for NLP, particularly through large language models like GPT. The purpose of this paper is to examine and evaluate whether traditional methods such as paraphrasing and backtranslation can leverage a new generation of models to achieve comparable performance to purely generative methods. Methods aimed at solving the problem of data scarcity and utilizing ChatGPT were chosen, as well as an exemplary dataset. We conducted a series of experiments comparing four different approaches to data augmentation in multiple experimental setups. We then evaluated the results both in terms of the quality of generated data and its impact on classification performance. The key findings indicate that backtranslation and paraphrasing can yield comparable or even better results than zero and a few-shot generation of examples.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model and its variants for classifying collaborative problem solving (CPS) has been extensively explored within the AI in Education community. However, limited attention has been given to understanding how individual tokenised words in the dataset contribute to the model's classification decisions. Enhancing the explainability of BERT-based CPS diagnostics is essential to better inform end users such as teachers, thereby fostering greater trust and facilitating wider adoption in education. This study undertook a preliminary step towards model transparency and explainability by using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to examine how different tokenised words in transcription data contributed to a BERT model's classification of CPS processes. The findings suggested that well-performing classifications did not necessarily equate to a reasonable explanation for the classification decisions. Particular tokenised words were used frequently to affect classifications. The analysis also identified a spurious word, which contributed positively to the classification but was not semantically meaningful to the class. While such model transparency is unlikely to be useful to an end user to improve their practice, it can help them not to overrely on LLM diagnostics and ignore their human expertise. We conclude the workshop paper by noting that the extent to which the model appropriately uses the tokens for its classification is associated with the number of classes involved. It calls for an investigation into the exploration of ensemble model architectures and the involvement of human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis, since considerable human reasoning is still required for fine-grained discrimination of CPS subskills.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) perform best with well-crafted prompts, yet prompt engineering remains manual, inconsistent, and inaccessible to non-experts. We introduce Promptomatix, an automatic prompt optimization framework that transforms natural language task descriptions into high-quality prompts without requiring manual tuning or domain expertise. Promptomatix supports both a lightweight meta-prompt-based optimizer and a DSPy-powered compiler, with modular design enabling future extension to more advanced frameworks. The system analyzes user intent, generates synthetic training data, selects prompting strategies, and refines prompts using cost-aware objectives. Evaluated across 5 task categories, Promptomatix achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing libraries, while reducing prompt length and computational overhead making prompt optimization scalable and efficient.

  Large language models (LLMs) leverage deep learning to process and predict sequences of words from context, enabling them to perform various NLP tasks, such as translation, summarization, question answering, and content generation. However, the growing size and complexity of developing, training, and deploying advanced LLMs require extensive computational resources and large datasets. This creates a barrier for users. As a result, platforms that host models and datasets are widely used. For example, Hugging Face, one of the most popular platforms, hosted 1.8 million models and 450K datasets by June 2025, with no sign of slowing down. Since many LLMs are built from base models, pre-trained models, and external datasets, they can inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or malicious components from earlier models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical to understand the origin and development of these components to better detect potential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance. Motivated by this, our project aims to study the relationships between models and datasets, which are core components of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a method to systematically collect LLM supply chain data. Using this data, we build a directed heterogeneous graph to model the relationships between models and datasets, resulting in a structure with 397,376 nodes and 453,469 edges. We then perform various analyses and uncover several findings, such as: (i) the LLM supply chain graph is large, sparse, and follows a power-law degree distribution; (ii) it features a densely connected core and a fragmented periphery; (iii) datasets play pivotal roles in training; (iv) strong interdependence exists between models and datasets; and (v) the graph is dynamic, with daily updates reflecting the ecosystem's ongoing evolution.

  Multilingual Large Language Models(MLLMs) demonstrate strong generalization across languages, yet they remain prone to hallucinations, especially in low-resource languages, due to training data imbalances. These hallucinations, which include inaccurate or fabricated outputs, are particularly problematic in domain-specific generation tasks (Chataigner et al., 2024). To address this challenge, we propose CCL-XCoT(Curriculum-based Contrastive Learning-based Cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought), a two-stage fine-tuning framework for mitigating hallucination in MLLMs. Our approach first enhances cross-lingual semantic alignment through curriculum-based contrastive learning combined with next-token prediction during continued pre-training. Building on this foundation, we then introduce a cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought (XCoT) prompting strategy during instruction fine-tuning, which guides the model to reason in a high-resource language before generating answers in the target low-resource language. Experimental results show that CCL-XCoT reduces hallucination rates by up to 62% and substantially improves factual knowledge transfer across language pairs, without relying on external retrieval or multi-model ensembles.

  Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of knowledge, which often requires updates to correct factual errors, incorporate newly acquired information, or adapt model behavior. Model editing methods have emerged as efficient solutions for such updates, offering localized and precise knowledge modification at significantly lower computational cost than continual training. In parallel, LLMs are frequently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, the effect of fine-tuning on previously edited knowledge remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate how different fine-tuning objectives interact with various model editing techniques. Our findings show that edited knowledge is substantially more susceptible to forgetting during fine-tuning than intrinsic knowledge acquired through pre-training. This analysis highlights a key limitation of current editing approaches and suggests that evaluating edit robustness under downstream fine-tuning is critical for their practical deployment. We further find that freezing layers associated with edited content can significantly improve knowledge retention, offering insight into how future editing methods might be made more robust.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various applications. However, their use as writing assistants in specialized domains like finance, medicine, and law is often hampered by a lack of deep domain-specific knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. Existing solutions, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can suffer from inconsistency across multiple retrieval steps, while online search-based methods often degrade quality due to unreliable web content. To address these challenges, we introduce DeepWriter, a customizable, multimodal, long-form writing assistant that operates on a curated, offline knowledge base. DeepWriter leverages a novel pipeline that involves task decomposition, outline generation, multimodal retrieval, and section-by-section composition with reflection. By deeply mining information from a structured corpus and incorporating both textual and visual elements, DeepWriter generates coherent, factually grounded, and professional-grade documents. We also propose a hierarchical knowledge representation to enhance retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our experiments on financial report generation demonstrate that DeepWriter produces high-quality, verifiable articles that surpasses existing baselines in factual accuracy and generated content quality.

  Optimizing inference for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important due to the quadratic compute and linear memory complexity of Transformers. Existing approximation methods, such as key-value (KV) cache dropping, sparse attention, and prompt compression, typically rely on rough predictions of token or KV pair importance. We propose a novel framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to more accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we introduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, the first method that leverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair for more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft model's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt tokens. We motivate our methods with theoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the attention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher accuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in memory usage, latency, and throughput.

  Prior work on in-context copying has shown the existence of induction heads, which attend to and promote individual tokens during copying. In this work we discover a new type of induction head: concept-level induction heads, which copy entire lexical units instead of individual tokens. Concept induction heads learn to attend to the ends of multi-token words throughout training, working in parallel with token-level induction heads to copy meaningful text. We show that these heads are responsible for semantic tasks like word-level translation, whereas token induction heads are vital for tasks that can only be done verbatim (like copying nonsense tokens). These two "routes" operate independently: we show that ablation of token induction heads causes models to paraphrase where they would otherwise copy verbatim. By patching concept induction head outputs, we find that they contain language-independent word representations that mediate natural language translation, suggesting that LLMs represent abstract word meanings independent of language or form.

  This paper reports the first brain-inspired large language model (BriLLM). This is a non-Transformer, non-GPT, non-traditional machine learning input-output controlled generative language model. The model is based on the Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) definition on the directed graph in terms of the neural network, and has the interpretability of all nodes on the graph of the whole model, instead of the traditional machine learning model that only has limited interpretability at the input and output ends. In the language model scenario, the token is defined as a node in the graph. A randomly shaped or user-defined signal flow flows between nodes on the principle of "least resistance" along paths. The next token or node to be predicted or generated is the target of the signal flow. As a language model, BriLLM theoretically supports infinitely long $n$-gram models when the model size is independent of the input and predicted length of the model. The model's working signal flow provides the possibility of recall activation and innate multi-modal support similar to the cognitive patterns of the human brain. At present, we released the first BriLLM version in Chinese, with 4000 tokens, 32-dimensional node width, 16-token long sequence prediction ability, and language model prediction performance comparable to GPT-1. More computing power will help us explore the infinite possibilities depicted above.

  Automatic evaluation of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems relies on fine-grained dimensions like faithfulness and relevance, as judged by expert human annotators. Meta-evaluation benchmarks support the development of automatic evaluators that correlate well with human judgement. However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on English or use translated data, which fails to capture cultural nuances. A native approach provides a better representation of the end user experience.In this work, we develop a Multilingual End-to-end Meta-Evaluation RAG benchmark (MEMERAG). Our benchmark builds on the popular MIRACL dataset, using native-language questions and generating responses with diverse large language models (LLMs), which are then assessed by expert annotators for faithfulness and relevance. We describe our annotation process and show that it achieves high inter-annotator agreement. We then analyse the performance of the answer-generating LLMs across languages as per the human evaluators. Finally we apply the dataset to our main use-case which is to benchmark multilingual automatic evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge). We show that our benchmark can reliably identify improvements offered by advanced prompting techniques and LLMs. Our dataset is available atthis https URL

  Modern large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on some tasks, while exhibiting distinctly non-human-like behaviors on others. This raises the question of how well the LLM's learned representations align with human representations. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to study representation alignment: we adopt a method from research on activation steering to identify neurons responsible for specific concepts (e.g., ''cat'') and then analyze the corresponding activation patterns. We find that LLM representations captured this way closely align with human representations inferred from behavioral data, matching inter-human alignment levels. Our approach significantly outperforms the alignment captured by word embeddings, which have been the focus of prior work on human-LLM alignment. Additionally, our approach enables a more granular view of how LLMs represent concepts -- we show that LLMs organize concepts in a way that mirrors human concept organization.

  Game-theoretic scenarios have become pivotal in evaluating the social intelligence of Large Language Model (LLM)-based social agents. While numerous studies have explored these agents in such settings, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey summarizing the current progress. To address this gap, we systematically review existing research on LLM-based social agents within game-theoretic scenarios. Our survey organizes the findings into three core components: Game Framework, Social Agent, and Evaluation Protocol. The game framework encompasses diverse game scenarios, ranging from choice-focusing to communication-focusing games. The social agent part explores agents' preferences, beliefs, and reasoning abilities, as well as their interactions and synergistic effects on decision-making. The evaluation protocol covers both game-agnostic and game-specific metrics for assessing agent performance. Additionally, we analyze the performance of current social agents across various game scenarios.

  Extensive previous research has focused on post-training knowledge editing (KE) for language models (LMs) to ensure that knowledge remains accurate and up-to-date. One desired property and open question in KE is to let edited LMs correctly handle ripple effects, where LM is expected to answer its logically related knowledge accurately. In this paper, we answer the question of why most KE methods still create messy ripple effects. We conduct extensive analysis and identify a salient indicator, GradSim, that effectively reveals when and why updated knowledge ripples in LMs. GradSim is computed by the cosine similarity between gradients of the original fact and its related knowledge. We observe a strong positive correlation between ripple effect performance and GradSim across different LMs, KE methods, and evaluation metrics. Further investigations into three counter-intuitive failure cases (Negation, Over-Ripple, Multi-Lingual) of ripple effects demonstrate that these failures are often associated with very low GradSim. This finding validates that GradSim is an effective indicator of when knowledge ripples in LMs.

  Assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in performing different tasks is crucial for understanding their strengths and weaknesses. This paper presents Hierarchical Prompting Taxonomy (HPT), grounded on human cognitive principles and designed to assess LLMs by examining the cognitive demands of various tasks. The HPT utilizes the Hierarchical Prompting Framework (HPF), which structures five unique prompting strategies in a hierarchical order based on their cognitive requirement on LLMs when compared to human mental capabilities. It assesses the complexity of tasks with the Hierarchical Prompting Index (HPI), which demonstrates the cognitive competencies of LLMs across diverse datasets and offers insights into the cognitive demands that datasets place on different LLMs. This approach enables a comprehensive evaluation of an LLMs problem solving abilities and the intricacy of a dataset, offering a standardized metric for task complexity. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets and LLMs show that HPF enhances LLM performance by 2% to 63% compared to baseline performance, with GSM8k being the most cognitively complex task among reasoning and coding tasks with an average HPI of 3.20 confirming the effectiveness of HPT. To support future research and reproducibility in this domain, the implementations of HPT and HPF are available here.

  Dialogue systems (DS), including the task-oriented dialogue system (TOD) and the open-domain dialogue system (ODD), have always been a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), allowing various applications in practice. Owing to sophisticated training and well-designed model architecture, language models (LM) are usually adopted as the necessary backbone to build the dialogue system. Consequently, every breakthrough in LM brings about a shift in learning paradigm and research attention within dialogue system, especially the appearance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we take a deep look at the history of the dialogue system, especially its special relationship with the advancements of language models. Thus, our survey offers a systematic perspective, categorizing different stages in a chronological order aligned with LM breakthroughs, providing a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research outcomes. What's more, we turn our attention to emerging topics and engage in a discussion on open challenges, providing valuable insights into the future directions for LLM-based dialogue systems. In summary, this survey delves into the dynamic interplay between language models and dialogue systems, unraveling the evolutionary path of this essential relationship. Through this exploration, we pave the way for a deeper comprehension of the field, guiding future developments in LM-based dialogue systems.

  Arabic is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, yet efforts to develop and evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for Arabic remain relatively limited. Most existing Arabic benchmarks focus on linguistic, cultural, or religious content, leaving a significant gap in domains like STEM and code which are increasingly relevant for real-world LLM applications. To help bridge this gap, we present 3LM, a suite of three benchmarks designed specifically for Arabic. The first is a set of STEM-related question-answer pairs, naturally sourced from Arabic textbooks and educational worksheets. The second consists of synthetically generated STEM questions, created using the same sources. The third benchmark focuses on code generation, built through a careful translation of two widely used code benchmarks, incorporating a human-in-the-loop process with several rounds of review to ensure high-quality and faithful translations. We release all three benchmarks publicly to support the growth of Arabic LLM research in these essential but underrepresented areas.

  Large Language Models (LLM) have dominated the science and media landscape duo to their impressive performance on processing large chunks of data and produce human-like levels of text. Nevertheless, their huge energy demand and slow processing still a bottleneck for further increasing quality while also making the models accessible to everyone. To solve this bottleneck, we will investigate how reservoir computing performs on natural text processing, which could enable fast and energy efficient hardware implementations. Studies investigating the use of reservoir computing as a language model remain sparse. In this paper, we compare three distinct approaches for character-level language modeling, two different reservoir computing approaches, where only an output layer is trainable, and the well-known transformer-based architectures, which fully learn an attention-based sequence representation. We explore the performance, computational cost and prediction accuracy for both paradigms by equally varying the number of trainable parameters for all models. Using a consistent pipeline for all three approaches, we demonstrate that transformers excel in prediction quality, whereas reservoir computers remain highly efficient reducing the training and inference speed. Furthermore, we investigate two types of reservoir computing: a traditional reservoir with a static linear readout, and an attention-enhanced reservoir that dynamically adapts its output weights via an attention mechanism. Our findings underline how these paradigms scale and offer guidelines to balance resource constraints with performance.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become an effective post-training method for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), mainly by shaping higher-order behaviors such as reflection and planning. However, previous RLVR algorithms often apply uniform training signals to all tokens, without considering the different roles of low-entropy knowledge-related tokens and high-entropy reasoning-related tokens. Some recent methods try to separate these token types by gradient masking or asynchronous updates, but these approaches may break semantic dependencies in the model output and hinder effective learning. In this work, we propose Archer, an entropy-aware RLVR approach with dual-token constraints and synchronous updates. Specifically, our method applies weaker KL regularization and higher clipping thresholds to reasoning tokens to encourage exploration, while using stronger constraints on knowledge tokens to maintain factual knowledge. Experimental results on several mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms previous RLVR methods, reaching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed their impressive ability to perform multi-step, logic-driven reasoning across complex domains, positioning them as powerful tools and collaborators in scientific discovery while challenging the long-held view that inspiration-driven ideation is uniquely human. However, the lack of a dedicated benchmark that evaluates LLMs' ability to develop ideas in Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) settings poses a critical barrier to fully understanding their strengths and limitations. To address this gap, we introduce IDRBench -- a pioneering benchmark featuring an expert annotated dataset and a suite of tasks tailored to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in proposing valuable research ideas from different scientific domains for interdisciplinary research. This benchmark aims to provide a systematic framework for assessing LLM performance in complex, cross-domain scientific research. Our dataset consists of scientific publications sourced from the ArXiv platform covering six distinct disciplines, and is annotated by domain experts with diverse academic backgrounds. To ensure high-quality annotations, we emphasize clearly defined dimensions that characterize authentic interdisciplinary research. The design of evaluation tasks in IDRBench follows a progressive, real-world perspective, reflecting the natural stages of interdisciplinary research development, including 1) IDR Paper Identification, 2) IDR Idea Integration, and 3) IDR Idea Recommendation. Using IDRBench, we construct baselines across 10 LLMs and observe that despite fostering some level of IDR awareness, LLMs still struggle to produce quality IDR ideas. These findings could not only spark new research directions, but also help to develop next-generation LLMs that excel in interdisciplinary research.

  The SemEval-2025 Task 11, Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection, introduces an emotion recognition challenge spanning over 28 languages. This competition encourages researchers to explore more advanced approaches to address the challenges posed by the diversity of emotional expressions and background variations. It features two tracks: multi-label classification (Track A) and emotion intensity prediction (Track B), covering six emotion categories: anger, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and disgust. In our work, we systematically explore the benefits of two contrastive learning approaches: sample-based (Contrastive Reasoning Calibration) and generation-based (DPO, SimPO) contrastive learning. The sample-based contrastive approach trains the model by comparing two samples to generate more reliable predictions. The generation-based contrastive approach trains the model to differentiate between correct and incorrect generations, refining its prediction. All models are fine-tuned from LLaMa3-Instruct-8B. Our system achieves 9th place in Track A and 6th place in Track B for English, while ranking among the top-tier performing systems for other languages.

  Current large language model (LLM) applications often employ multi-component prompts, comprising both system and user prompts, to guide model behaviors. While recent advancements have demonstrated the efficacy of automatically optimizing either the system or user prompt to boost performance, such unilateral approaches often yield suboptimal outcomes due to the interdependent nature of these components. In this work, we introduce P3, a novel self-improvement framework that concurrently optimizes both system and user prompts through an iterative process. The offline optimized prompts are further leveraged to promote online prompting by performing query-dependent prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on general tasks (e.g., Arena-hard and Alpaca-eval) and reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K and GPQA) demonstrate that P3 achieves superior performance in the realm of automatic prompt optimization. Our results highlight the effectiveness of a holistic optimization strategy in enhancing LLM performance across diverse domains.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively improves the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, retrieval noises significantly impact the quality of LLMs' generation, necessitating the development of denoising mechanisms. Previous methods extract evidence straightforwardly without explicit thinking, which risks filtering out key clues and struggles with generalization. To this end, we propose LEAR, which learns to extract rational evidence by (1) explicitly reasoning to identify potential cues within retrieval contents first, and then (2) consciously extracting to avoid omitting any key cues helpful for answering questions. Specifically, we frame evidence reasoning and evidence extraction into one unified response for end-to-end training; apply knowledge token masks for disentanglement to derive reasoning-based and extraction-based answers; and devise three types of verifiable reward functions, including answer, length, and format, to update the model via the policy optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of LEAR, providing compact and high-quality evidence, improving the accuracy of downstream tasks, and promoting effective application in online RAG systems.

  Despite recent progress in large language models (LLMs), evaluation of text generation tasks such as text style transfer (TST) remains a significant challenge. Recent studies (Dementieva et al., 2024; Pauli et al., 2025) revealed a substantial gap between automatic metrics and human judgments. Moreover, most prior work focuses exclusively on English, leaving multilingual TST evaluation largely unexplored. In this paper, we perform the first comprehensive multilingual study on evaluation of text detoxification system across nine languages: English, Spanish, German, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, Ukrainian, Russian, Amharic. Drawing inspiration from the machine translation, we assess the effectiveness of modern neural-based evaluation models alongside prompting-based LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Our findings provide a practical recipe for designing more reliable multilingual TST evaluation pipeline in the text detoxification case.

  Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is a promising approach to progressively elicit the model's intelligence during inference. Recently, training-based TTS methods, such as continued reinforcement learning (RL), have further surged in popularity, while training-free TTS methods are gradually fading from prominence. However, the additional computation overhead of training amplifies the burden on test-time scaling. In this paper, we focus on training-free TTS methods for reasoning. We first design Conditional Step-level Self-refinement, a fine-grained sequential scaling method guided by process verification. On top of its effectiveness, we further combine it with other classical parallel scaling methods at the step level, to introduce a novel inference paradigm called Hybrid Test-Time Scaling. Extensive experiments on five instruction-tuned LLMs across different scales (3B-14B) and families demonstrate that hybrid strategy incorporating various training-free TTS methods at a fine granularity has considerable potential for expanding the reasoning performance boundaries of LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent progress in LLMs, such as reasoning models, has demonstrated strong abilities to solve complex competitive programming problems, often rivaling top human competitors. However, it remains underexplored whether these abilities generalize to relevant domains that are less seen during training. To address this, we introduce AlgoSimBench, a new benchmark designed to assess LLMs' ability to identify algorithmically similar problems (ASPs)-problems that can be solved using similar algorithmic approaches. AlgoSimBench consists of 1317 problems, annotated with 231 distinct fine-grained algorithm tags, from which we curate 402 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), where each question presents one algorithmically similar problem alongside three textually similar but algorithmically dissimilar distractors. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs struggle to identify ASPs, with the best-performing model (o3-mini) achieving only 65.9% accuracy on the MCQ task. To address this challenge, we propose attempted solution matching (ASM), a novel method for improving problem similarity detection. On our MCQ task, ASM yields an absolute accuracy improvement of 6.7% to 11.7% across different models. We also evaluated code embedding models and retrieval methods on similar problem identification. While the adversarial selection of problems degrades the performance to be less than random, we found that simply summarizing the problem to remove narrative elements eliminates the effect, and combining ASM with a keyword-prioritized method, BM25, can yield up to 52.2% accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in question-answering domains, it is common to ask the model to choose among a fixed set of choices (so-called multiple-choice question-answering, or MCQA). Although downstream tasks of interest typically do not provide systems with explicit options among which to choose, this approach is nevertheless widely used because it makes it makes automatic grading straightforward and has tended to produce challenging benchmarks that correlate sufficiently well with downstream performance. This paper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for state-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of $15$ different question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HLE) and $25$ different LLMs (including small models such as Qwen 7B and relatively large models such as Llama 70B). For each model-benchmark pair, we considered $5$ ways of presenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple choices were offered to the model at all; whether "none of the above" sometimes replaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform chain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented. MCQA remained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they were allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only before being presented with the options among which they had to select. On the other hand, large models that were able to perform reasoning after being given a set of options tended to significantly outperform their free-text performance due to exploiting the information in the options. We conclude that MCQA is no longer a good proxy for assessing downstream performance of state-of-the-art models, and offer practical guidelines for designing more robust, bias-resistant benchmarks that better reflect LLMs' genuine reasoning capabilities.

  We present a novel evaluation paradigm for AI text detectors that prioritizes real-world and equitable assessment. Current approaches predominantly report conventional metrics like AUROC, overlooking that even modest false positive rates constitute a critical impediment to practical deployment of detection systems. Furthermore, real-world deployment necessitates predetermined threshold configuration, making detector stability (i.e. the maintenance of consistent performance across diverse domains and adversarial scenarios), a critical factor. These aspects have been largely ignored in previous research and benchmarks. Our benchmark, SHIELD, addresses these limitations by integrating both reliability and stability factors into a unified evaluation metric designed for practical assessment. Furthermore, we develop a post-hoc, model-agnostic humanification framework that modifies AI text to more closely resemble human authorship, incorporating a controllable hardness parameter. This hardness-aware approach effectively challenges current SOTA zero-shot detection methods in maintaining both reliability and stability. (Data and code:this https URL)

  Building high-quality data resources is crucial for advancing artificial intelligence research and applications in specific domains, particularly in the Chinese medical domain. Existing Chinese medical datasets are limited in size and narrow in domain coverage, falling short of the diverse corpora required for effective pre-training. Moreover, most datasets are designed solely for LLM fine-tuning and do not support pre-training and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a Chinese medical dataset named ChiMed 2.0, which extends our previous work ChiMed, and covers data collected from Chinese medical online platforms and generated by LLMs. ChiMed 2.0 contains 204.4M Chinese characters covering both traditional Chinese medicine classics and modern general medical data, where there are 164.8K documents for pre-training, 351.6K question-answering pairs for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and 41.7K preference data tuples for RLHF. To validate the effectiveness of our approach for training a Chinese medical LLM, we conduct further pre-training, SFT, and RLHF experiments on representative general domain LLMs and evaluate their performance on medical benchmark datasets. The results show performance gains across different model scales, validating the dataset's effectiveness and applicability.

  This paper addresses the challenges of high computational cost and slow inference in deploying large language models. It proposes a distillation strategy guided by multiple teacher models. The method constructs several teacher models and integrates their output probability distributions and intermediate semantic features. This guides the student model to learn from multiple sources of knowledge. As a result, the student model gains stronger language understanding and generation ability while maintaining a small parameter size. To achieve this, the paper introduces a weighted output fusion mechanism, a feature alignment loss function, and an entropy-driven dynamic teacher weighting strategy. These components improve the quality and stability of knowledge transfer during distillation. Under multi-teacher guidance, the student model captures semantic information more effectively and demonstrates strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. In particular, the method shows high consistency in expression, generalization ability, and task adaptability in tasks such as language modeling, text generation, and multi-task learning. The experiments compare the proposed method with several widely adopted distillation approaches. The results further confirm its overall advantages in perplexity, distillation loss, and generation quality. This study provides a feasible technical path for the efficient compression of large-scale language models. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-teacher collaborative mechanisms in complex language modeling tasks.

  Synthetic text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly used for further training and improvement of LLMs. Diversity is crucial for the effectiveness of synthetic data, and researchers rely on prompt engineering to improve diversity. However, the impact of prompt variations on response text length, and, more importantly, the consequential effect on lexical diversity measurements, remain underexplored. In this work, we propose Penalty-Adjusted Type-Token Ratio (PATTR), a diversity metric robust to length variations. We generate a large synthetic corpus of over 20M words using seven models from the LLaMA, OLMo, and Phi families, focusing on a creative writing task of video script generation, where diversity is crucial. We evaluate per-response lexical diversity using PATTR and compare it against existing metrics of Moving-Average TTR (MATTR) and Compression Ratio (CR). Our analysis highlights how text length variations introduce biases favoring shorter responses. Unlike existing metrics, PATTR explicitly considers the task-specific target response length ($L_T$) to effectively mitigate length biases. We further demonstrate the utility of PATTR in filtering the top-10/100/1,000 most lexically diverse responses, showing that it consistently outperforms MATTR and CR by yielding on par or better diversity with high adherence to $L_T$.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), developing effective critic modules for precise guidance has become crucial yet challenging. In this paper, we initially demonstrate that supervised fine-tuning for building critic modules (which is widely adopted in current solutions) fails to genuinely enhance models' critique abilities, producing superficial critiques with insufficient reflections and verifications. To unlock the unprecedented critique capabilities, we propose RefCritic, a long-chain-of-thought critic module based on reinforcement learning with dual rule-based rewards: (1) instance-level correctness of solution judgments and (2) refinement accuracies of the policy model based on critiques, aiming to generate high-quality evaluations with actionable feedback that effectively guides model refinement. We evaluate RefCritic on Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B across five benchmarks. On critique and refinement settings, RefCritic demonstrates consistent advantages across all benchmarks, e.g., 6.8\% and 7.2\% gains on AIME25 for the respective base models. Notably, under majority voting, policy models filtered by RefCritic show superior scaling with increased voting numbers. Moreover, despite training on solution-level supervision, RefCritic outperforms step-level supervised approaches on ProcessBench, a benchmark to identify erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on reasoning-intensive tasks, yet optimizing their reasoning efficiency remains an open challenge. While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves reasoning quality, it often leads to overthinking, wasting tokens on redundant computations. This work investigates how to efficiently and adaptively guide LLM test-time scaling without additional training. Inspired by the concept of momentum in physics, we propose Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR), which dynamically allocates thinking budgets to critical reasoning steps by tracking and aggregating stepwise uncertainty over time. To support flexible inference-time control, we introduce gamma-control, a simple mechanism that tunes the reasoning budget via a single hyperparameter. We provide in-depth theoretical proof to support the superiority of MUR in terms of stability and biases. MUR is comprehensively evaluated against various TTS methods across four challenging benchmarks (MATH-500, AIME24, AIME25, and GPQA-diamond) using different sizes of recent Qwen3 models (1.7B, 4B, and 8B). Results demonstrate that MUR reduces computation by over 50% on average while improving accuracy by 0.62-3.37%.

  Persona-driven LLMs have emerged as powerful tools in computational social science, yet existing approaches fall at opposite extremes, either relying on costly human-curated data or producing synthetic personas that lack consistency and realism. We introduce SYNTHIA, a dataset of 30,000 backstories derived from 10,000 real social media users from BlueSky open platform across three time windows, bridging this spectrum by grounding synthetic generation in authentic user activity. Our evaluation demonstrates that SYNTHIA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods in demographic diversity and social survey alignment while significantly outperforming them in narrative consistency. Uniquely, SYNTHIA incorporates temporal dimensionality and provides rich social interaction metadata from the underlying network, enabling new research directions in computational social science and persona-driven language modeling.

  Evaluating LLMs with a single prompt has proven unreliable, with small changes leading to significant performance differences. However, generating the prompt variations needed for a more robust multi-prompt evaluation is challenging, limiting its adoption in practice. To address this, we introduce PromptSuite, a framework that enables the automatic generation of various prompts. PromptSuite is flexible - working out of the box on a wide range of tasks and benchmarks. It follows a modular prompt design, allowing controlled perturbations to each component, and is extensible, supporting the addition of new components and perturbation types. Through a series of case studies, we show that PromptSuite provides meaningful variations to support strong evaluation practices. It is available through both a Python API:this https URL, and a user-friendly web interface:this https URL

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multilingual capabilities, however, how to evaluate cross-lingual alignment remains underexplored. Existing alignment benchmarks primarily focus on sentence embeddings, but prior research has shown that neural models tend to induce a non-smooth representation space, which impact of semantic alignment evaluation on low-resource languages. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that similar information activates overlapping neuronal regions, we propose a novel Neuron State-Based Cross-Lingual Alignment (NeuronXA) to assess the cross-lingual a lignment capabilities of LLMs, which offers a more semantically grounded approach to assess cross-lingual alignment. We evaluate NeuronXA on several prominent multilingual LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, GLM, and OLMo) across two transfer tasks and three multilingual benchmarks. The results demonstrate that with only 100 parallel sentence pairs, NeuronXA achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.9556 with downstream tasks performance and 0.8514 with transferability. These findings demonstrate NeuronXA's effectiveness in assessing both cross-lingual alignment and transferability, even with a small dataset. This highlights its potential to advance cross-lingual alignment research and to improve the semantic understanding of multilingual LLMs.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive multilingual capabilities, but they suffer from unexpected code-switching, also known as language mixing, which involves switching to unexpected languages in the model response. This problem leads to poor readability and degrades the usability of model responses. However, existing work on this issue lacks a mechanistic analysis and shows limited effectiveness. In this paper, we first provide an in-depth analysis of unexpected code-switching using sparse autoencoders and find that when LLMs switch to a language, the features of that language exhibit excessive pre-activation values. Based on our findings, we propose $\textbf{S}$parse $\textbf{A}$utoencoder-guided $\textbf{S}$upervised $\textbf{F}$ine$\textbf{t}$uning (SASFT), which teaches LLMs to maintain appropriate pre-activation values of specific language features during training. Experiments on five models across three languages demonstrate that SASFT consistently reduces unexpected code-switching by more than 50\% compared to standard supervised fine-tuning, with complete elimination in four cases. Moreover, SASFT maintains or even improves the models' performance on six multilingual benchmarks, showing its effectiveness in addressing code-switching while preserving multilingual capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although large language models (LLMs) excel in text comprehension and generation, their performance on the Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) task, which requires reasoning ability, is often underperform smaller language model. The main reason is the lack of auxiliary knowledge, which limits LLMs' ability to effectively perceive emotions and reason causes. To address this issue, we propose a novel \textbf{M}ulti-source h\textbf{E}terogeneous \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{i}njection me\textbf{T}hod, MEKiT, which integrates heterogeneous internal emotional knowledge and external causal knowledge. Specifically, for these two distinct aspects and structures of knowledge, we apply the approaches of incorporating instruction templates and mixing data for instruction-tuning, which respectively facilitate LLMs in more comprehensively identifying emotion and accurately reasoning causes. Experimental results demonstrate that MEKiT provides a more effective and adaptable solution for the ECPE task, exhibiting an absolute performance advantage over compared baselines and dramatically improving the performance of LLMs on the ECPE task.

  A prominent achievement of natural language processing (NLP) is its ability to understand and generate meaningful human language. This capability relies on complex feedforward transformer block architectures pre-trained on large language models (LLMs). However, LLM pre-training is currently feasible only for a few dominant companies due to the immense computational resources required, limiting broader research participation. This creates a critical need for more accessible alternatives. In this study, we explore whether tiny language models (TLMs) exhibit the same key qualitative features of LLMs. We demonstrate that TLMs exhibit a clear performance gap between pre-trained and non-pre-trained models across classification tasks, indicating the effectiveness of pre-training, even at a tiny scale. The performance gap increases with the size of the pre-training dataset and with greater overlap between tokens in the pre-training and classification datasets. Furthermore, the classification accuracy achieved by a pre-trained deep TLM architecture can be replicated through a soft committee of multiple, independently pre-trained shallow architectures, enabling low-latency TLMs without affecting classification accuracy. Our results are based on pre-training BERT-6 and variants of BERT-1 on subsets of the Wikipedia dataset and evaluating their performance on FewRel, AGNews, and DBPedia classification tasks. Future research on TLM is expected to further illuminate the mechanisms underlying NLP, especially given that its biologically inspired models suggest that TLMs may be sufficient for children or adolescents to develop language.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in transforming text descriptions or tables to data visualizations via instruction-tuning methods. However, it is not straightforward to apply these methods directly for a more real-world use case of visualizing data from long documents based on user-given intents, as opposed to the user pre-selecting the relevant content manually. We introduce the task of intent-based chart generation from documents: given a user-specified intent and document(s), the goal is to generate a chart adhering to the intent and grounded on the document(s) in a zero-shot setting. We propose an unsupervised, two-staged framework in which an LLM first extracts relevant information from the document(s) by decomposing the intent and iteratively validates and refines this data. Next, a heuristic-guided module selects an appropriate chart type before final code generation. To assess the data accuracy of the generated charts, we propose an attribution-based metric that uses a structured textual representation of charts, instead of relying on visual decoding metrics that often fail to capture the chart data effectively. To validate our approach, we curate a dataset comprising of 1,242 $<$intent, document, charts$>$ tuples from two domains, finance and scientific, in contrast to the existing datasets that are largely limited to parallel text descriptions/ tables and their corresponding charts. We compare our approach with baselines using single-shot chart generation using LLMs and query-based retrieval methods; our method outperforms by upto $9$ points and $17$ points in terms of chart data accuracy and chart type respectively over the best baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant progress in Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs), enhancing their capabilities in both speech understanding and generation. While existing LSLMs often concentrate on augmenting speech generation or tackling a diverse array of short-speech tasks, the efficient processing of long-form speech remains a critical yet underexplored challenge. This gap is primarily attributed to the scarcity of long-speech training datasets and the high computational costs associated with long sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce FastLongSpeech, a novel framework designed to extend LSLM capabilities for efficient long-speech processing without necessitating dedicated long-speech training data. FastLongSpeech incorporates an iterative fusion strategy that can compress excessively long-speech sequences into manageable lengths. To adapt LSLMs for long-speech inputs, it introduces a dynamic compression training approach, which exposes the model to short-speech sequences at varying compression ratios, thereby transferring the capabilities of LSLMs to long-speech tasks. To assess the long-speech capabilities of LSLMs, we develop a long-speech understanding benchmark called LongSpeech-Eval. Experiments show that our method exhibits strong performance in both long-speech and short-speech tasks, while greatly improving inference efficiency.

  Large language models have recently evolved from fluent text generation to advanced reasoning across diverse domains, giving rise to reasoning language models. Among these domains, mathematical reasoning serves as a representative benchmark as it requires precise multi-step logic and abstract reasoning, which can be generalized to other tasks. While closed-source RLMs such as GPT-o3 demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, their proprietary nature limits transparency and reproducibility. Although many open-source projects aim to close this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical resources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders reproducibility. To contribute toward greater transparency in RLM development, we introduce the MiroMind-M1 series, a set of fully open-source RLMs built on the Qwen-2.5 backbone that match or exceed the performance of existing open-source RLMs. Specifically, our models are trained in two stages: SFT on a carefully curated corpus of 719K math-reasoning problems with verified CoT trajectories, followed by RLVR on 62K challenging and verifiable problems. To enhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce Context-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates length-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage context-aware RL training. Our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance and superior token efficiency among Qwen-2.5-based open-source 7B and 32B models on the AIME24, AIME25, and MATH benchmarks. To facilitate reproducibility, we release the complete stack: models (MiroMind-M1-SFT-7B, MiroMind-M1-RL-7B, MiroMind-M1-RL-32B); datasets (MiroMind-M1-SFT-719K, MiroMind-M1-RL-62K); and all training and evaluation configurations. We hope these resources will support further research and foster community advancement.

  Background: Medical coding structures healthcare data for research, quality monitoring, and policy. This study assesses the potential of large language models (LLMs) to assign ICPC-2 codes using the output of a domain-specific search engine.Methods: A dataset of 437 Brazilian Portuguese clinical expressions, each annotated with ICPC-2 codes, was used. A semantic search engine (OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large) retrieved candidates from 73,563 labeled concepts. Thirty-three LLMs were prompted with each query and retrieved results to select the best-matching ICPC-2 code. Performance was evaluated using F1-score, along with token usage, cost, response time, and format adherence.Results: Twenty-eight models achieved F1-score > 0.8; ten exceeded 0.85. Top performers included gpt-4.5-preview, o3, and gemini-2.5-pro. Retriever optimization can improve performance by up to 4 points. Most models returned valid codes in the expected format, with reduced hallucinations. Smaller models (<3B) struggled with formatting and input length.Conclusions: LLMs show strong potential for automating ICPC-2 coding, even without fine-tuning. This work offers a benchmark and highlights challenges, but findings are limited by dataset scope and setup. Broader, multilingual, end-to-end evaluations are needed for clinical validation.

  Pre-training data shapes a language model's quality, but raw web text is noisy and demands careful cleaning. Existing large-scale corpora rely on English-centric or language-agnostic pipelines whose heuristics do not capture Thai script or cultural nuances, leaving risky material such as gambling content untreated. Prior Thai-specific efforts customize pipelines or build new ones, yet seldom release their data or document design choices, hindering reproducibility and raising the question of how to construct a transparent, high-quality Thai corpus. We introduce Mangosteen: a 47 billion-token Thai corpus built through a Thai-adapted Dolma pipeline that includes custom rule-based language ID, revised C4/Gopher quality filters, and Thai-trained content filters, plus curated non-web sources such as Wikipedia, Royal Gazette texts, OCR-extracted books, and CC-licensed YouTube subtitles. Systematic ablations using GPT-2 show the pipeline trims CommonCrawl from 202M to 25M documents while raising SEA-HELM NLG from 3 to 11; an 8B-parameter SEA-LION model continually pre-trained on Mangosteen then surpasses SEA-LION-v3 and Llama-3.1 by about four points on Thai benchmarks. We release the full pipeline code, cleaning manifests, corpus snapshot, and all checkpoints, providing a fully reproducible foundation for future Thai and regional LLM research.

  Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved significant advances in reasoning and demonstrated their advantages in solving challenging problems. Yet, their effectiveness in the semiconductor display industry remains limited due to a lack of domain-specific training and expertise. To bridge this gap, we present X-Intelligence 3.0, the first high-performance reasoning model specifically developed for the semiconductor display industry. This model is designed to deliver expert-level understanding and reasoning for the industry's complex challenges. Leveraging a carefully curated industry knowledge base, the model undergoes supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to enhance its reasoning and comprehension capabilities. To further accelerate development, we implemented an automated evaluation framework that simulates expert-level assessments. We also integrated a domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism, resulting in notable performance gains on benchmark datasets. Despite its relatively compact size of 32 billion parameters, X-Intelligence 3.0 outperforms SOTA DeepSeek-R1-671B across multiple evaluations. This demonstrates its exceptional efficiency and establishes it as a powerful solution to the longstanding reasoning challenges faced by the semiconductor display industry.

  Relation Classification (RC) in biomedical texts is essential for constructing knowledge graphs and enabling applications such as drug repurposing and clinical decision-making. We propose an error-aware teacher--student framework that improves RC through structured guidance from a large language model (GPT-4o). Prediction failures from a baseline student model are analyzed by the teacher to classify error types, assign difficulty scores, and generate targeted remediations, including sentence rewrites and suggestions for KG-based enrichment. These enriched annotations are used to train a first student model via instruction tuning. This model then annotates a broader dataset with difficulty scores and remediation-enhanced inputs. A second student is subsequently trained via curriculum learning on this dataset, ordered by difficulty, to promote robust and progressive learning. We also construct a heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph from PubMed abstracts to support context-aware RC. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance on 4 of 5 PPI datasets and the DDI dataset, while remaining competitive on ChemProt.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Meta's LLaMA offer a promising approach for scalable personality assessment from open-ended language. However, inferring personality traits remains challenging, and earlier work often relied on synthetic data or social media text lacking psychometric validity. We introduce a real-world benchmark of 555 semi-structured interviews with BFI-10 self-report scores for evaluating LLM-based personality inference. Three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4.1 Mini, Meta-LLaMA, and DeepSeek) were tested using zero-shot prompting for BFI-10 item prediction and both zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting for Big Five trait inference. All models showed high test-retest reliability, but construct validity was limited: correlations with ground-truth scores were weak (max Pearson's $r = 0.27$), interrater agreement was low (Cohen's $\kappa < 0.10$), and predictions were biased toward moderate or high trait levels. Chain-of-thought prompting and longer input context modestly improved distributional alignment, but not trait-level accuracy. These results underscore limitations in current LLM-based personality inference and highlight the need for evidence-based development for psychological applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Online news outlets operate predominantly on an advertising-based revenue model, compelling journalists to create headlines that are often scandalous, intriguing, and provocative -- commonly referred to as clickbait. Automatic detection of clickbait headlines is essential for preserving information quality and reader trust in digital media and requires both contextual understanding and world knowledge. For this task, particularly in less-resourced languages, it remains unclear whether fine-tuned methods or in-context learning (ICL) yield better results. In this paper, we compile CLIC, a novel dataset for clickbait detection of Croatian news headlines spanning a 20-year period and encompassing mainstream and fringe outlets. We fine-tune the BERTiƒá model on this task and compare its performance to LLM-based ICL methods with prompts both in Croatian and English. Finally, we analyze the linguistic properties of clickbait. We find that nearly half of the analyzed headlines contain clickbait, and that finetuned models deliver better results than general LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit increasingly sophisticated linguistic capabilities, yet the extent to which these behaviors reflect human-like cognition versus advanced pattern recognition remains an open question. In this study, we investigate how LLMs process the temporal meaning of linguistic aspect in narratives that were previously used in human studies. Using an Expert-in-the-Loop probing pipeline, we conduct a series of targeted experiments to assess whether LLMs construct semantic representations and pragmatic inferences in a human-like manner. Our findings show that LLMs over-rely on prototypicality, produce inconsistent aspectual judgments, and struggle with causal reasoning derived from aspect, raising concerns about their ability to fully comprehend narratives. These results suggest that LLMs process aspect fundamentally differently from humans and lack robust narrative understanding. Beyond these empirical findings, we develop a standardized experimental framework for the reliable assessment of LLMs' cognitive and linguistic capabilities.

  The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components: context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through this systematic analysis of over 1400 research papers, our survey not only establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs. Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately, this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers advancing context-aware AI.

  Text-based telemedicine has become increasingly common, yet the quality of medical advice in doctor-patient interactions is often judged more on how advice is communicated rather than its clinical accuracy. To address this, we introduce Dr. Copilot , a multi-agent large language model (LLM) system that supports Romanian-speaking doctors by evaluating and enhancing the presentation quality of their written responses. Rather than assessing medical correctness, Dr. Copilot provides feedback along 17 interpretable axes. The system comprises of three LLM agents with prompts automatically optimized via DSPy. Designed with low-resource Romanian data and deployed using open-weight models, it delivers real-time specific feedback to doctors within a telemedicine platform. Empirical evaluations and live deployment with 41 doctors show measurable improvements in user reviews and response quality, marking one of the first real-world deployments of LLMs in Romanian medical settings.

  We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks, where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity. Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost. Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting. Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models, including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage. Notably, KAT outperforms all open-source models and even surpasses o3-mini on the leakage-controlled LiveCodeBench Pro. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), where it improves real-world development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 40B active parameters, and early results already show significant gains, further demonstrating the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models often suffer from language confusion, a phenomenon in which responses are partially or entirely generated in unintended languages. This critically degrades the user experience, especially in low-resource settings. We hypothesize that this issue stems from limitations in conventional fine-tuning objectives, such as supervised learning, which optimize the likelihood of correct tokens without explicitly penalizing undesired outputs such as cross-lingual mixing. Analysis of loss trajectories during pretraining further reveals that models fail to distinguish between monolingual and language-mixed texts, highlighting the absence of inherent pressure to avoid such confusion. In this work, we apply ORPO, which adds penalties for unwanted output styles to standard SFT, effectively suppressing language-confused generations. ORPO maintains strong language consistency, even under high decoding temperatures, while preserving general QA performance. Our findings suggest that incorporating appropriate penalty terms can effectively mitigate language confusion in multilingual models, particularly in low-resource scenarios.

  To facilitate robust and trustworthy deployment of large language models (LLMs), it is essential to quantify the reliability of their generations through uncertainty estimation. While recent efforts have made significant advancements by leveraging the internal logic and linguistic features of LLMs to estimate uncertainty scores, our empirical analysis highlights the pitfalls of these methods to strike a harmonized estimation between indication, balance, and calibration, which hinders their broader capability for accurate uncertainty estimation. To address this challenge, we propose CUE (Corrector for Uncertainty Estimation): A straightforward yet effective method that employs a lightweight model trained on data aligned with the target LLM's performance to adjust uncertainty scores. Comprehensive experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, which achieves consistent improvements of up to 60% over existing methods.

  The emergence of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) has advanced the field of dialogue systems, enabling both realistic user simulations and robust multi-turn conversational agents. However, existing research often evaluates these components in isolation-either focusing on a single user simulator or a specific system design-limiting the generalisability of insights across architectures and configurations. In this work, we propose clem todd (chat-optimized LLMs for task-oriented dialogue systems development), a flexible framework for systematically evaluating dialogue systems under consistent conditions. clem todd enables detailed benchmarking across combinations of user simulators and dialogue systems, whether existing models from literature or newly developed ones. It supports plug-and-play integration and ensures uniform datasets, evaluation metrics, and computational constraints. We showcase clem todd's flexibility by re-evaluating existing task-oriented dialogue systems within this unified setup and integrating three newly proposed dialogue systems into the same evaluation pipeline. Our results provide actionable insights into how architecture, scale, and prompting strategies affect dialogue performance, offering practical guidance for building efficient and effective conversational AI systems.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential as evaluators of NLG systems, allowing for high-quality, reference-free, and multi-aspect assessments. However, existing LLM-based metrics suffer from two major drawbacks: reliance on proprietary models to generate training data or perform evaluations, and a lack of fine-grained, explanatory feedback. In this paper, we introduce OpeNLGauge, a fully open-source, reference-free NLG evaluation metric that provides accurate explanations based on error spans. OpeNLGauge is available as a two-stage ensemble of larger open-weight LLMs, or as a small fine-tuned evaluation model, with confirmed generalizability to unseen tasks, domains and aspects. Our extensive meta-evaluation shows that OpeNLGauge achieves competitive correlation with human judgments, outperforming state-of-the-art models on certain tasks while maintaining full reproducibility and providing explanations more than twice as accurate.

  We investigate the robustness of reasoning models trained for step-by-step problem solving by introducing query-agnostic adversarial triggers - short, irrelevant text that, when appended to math problems, systematically mislead models to output incorrect answers without altering the problem's semantics. We propose CatAttack, an automated iterative attack pipeline for generating triggers on a weaker, less expensive proxy model (DeepSeek V3) and successfully transfer them to more advanced reasoning target models like DeepSeek R1 and DeepSeek R1-distilled-Qwen-32B, resulting in greater than 300% increase in the likelihood of the target model generating an incorrect answer. For example, appending, "Interesting fact: cats sleep most of their lives," to any math problem leads to more than doubling the chances of a model getting the answer wrong. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in reasoning models, revealing that even state-of-the-art models remain susceptible to subtle adversarial inputs, raising security and reliability concerns.

  Emotions have been shown to play a role in argument convincingness, yet this aspect is underexplored in the natural language processing (NLP) community. Unlike prior studies that use static analyses, focus on a single text domain or language, or treat emotion as just one of many factors, we introduce a dynamic framework inspired by manipulation checks commonly used in psychology and social science; leveraging LLM-based manipulation checks, this framework examines the extent to which perceived emotional intensity influences perceived convincingness. Through human evaluation of arguments across different languages, text domains, and topics, we find that in over half of cases, human judgments of convincingness remain unchanged despite variations in perceived emotional intensity; when emotions do have an impact, they more often enhance rather than weaken convincingness. We further analyze whether 11 LLMs behave like humans in the same scenario, finding that while LLMs generally mirror human patterns, they struggle to capture nuanced emotional effects in individual judgments.

  We describe KVLink, an approach for efficient key-value (KV) cache reuse in large language models (LLMs). In many LLM applications, different inputs can share overlapping context, such as the same retrieved document appearing in multiple queries. However, the LLMs still need to encode the entire context for each query, leading to redundant computation. In this paper, we investigate a new strategy to eliminate such inefficiency, where the KV cache of each document is precomputed independently. During inference, the KV caches of retrieved documents are concatenated, allowing the model to reuse cached representations instead of recomputing them. To mitigate the performance degradation when using KV caches computed independently for each document, KVLink introduces two key techniques: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV cache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, and using trainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded documents. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that KVLink improves question answering accuracy by an average of 4% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, by leveraging precomputed KV caches, our approach reduces time-to-first-token by up to 96% compared to standard LLM inference, making it a scalable and efficient solution for context reuse. Additionally, KVLink can be combined with KV cache compression to further save cache loading and storage overhead while outperforming the baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, LLMs have garnered increasing attention across academic disciplines for their potential as human digital twins, virtual proxies designed to replicate individuals and autonomously perform tasks such as decision-making, problem-solving, and reasoning on their behalf. However, current evaluations of LLMs primarily emphasize dialogue simulation while overlooking human behavior simulation, which is crucial for digital twins. To address this gap, we introduce BehaviorChain, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to simulate continuous human behavior. BehaviorChain comprises diverse, high-quality, persona-based behavior chains, totaling 15,846 distinct behaviors across 1,001 unique personas, each with detailed history and profile metadata. For evaluation, we integrate persona metadata into LLMs and employ them to iteratively infer contextually appropriate behaviors within dynamic scenarios provided by BehaviorChain. Comprehensive evaluation results demonstrated that even state-of-the-art models struggle with accurately simulating continuous human behavior.

  Despite having a population of twenty million, Kazakhstan's culture and language remain underrepresented in the field of natural language processing. Although large language models (LLMs) continue to advance worldwide, progress in Kazakh language has been limited, as seen in the scarcity of dedicated models and benchmark evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce KazMMLU, the first MMLU-style dataset specifically designed for Kazakh language. KazMMLU comprises 23,000 questions that cover various educational levels, including STEM, humanities, and social sciences, sourced from authentic educational materials and manually validated by native speakers and educators. The dataset includes 10,969 Kazakh questions and 12,031 Russian questions, reflecting Kazakhstan's bilingual education system and rich local context. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art multilingual models (Llama-3.1, Qwen-2.5, GPT-4, and DeepSeek V3) demonstrates substantial room for improvement, as even the best-performing models struggle to achieve competitive performance in Kazakh and Russian. These findings underscore significant performance gaps compared to high-resource languages. We hope that our dataset will enable further research and development of Kazakh-centric LLMs. Data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite progress in Arabic large language models, such as Jais and AceGPT, their evaluation on commonsense reasoning has largely relied on machine-translated datasets, which lack cultural depth and may introduce Anglocentric biases. Commonsense reasoning is shaped by geographical and cultural contexts, and existing English datasets fail to capture the diversity of the Arab world. To address this, we introduce ArabCulture, a commonsense reasoning dataset in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), covering cultures of 13 countries across the Gulf, Levant, North Africa, and the Nile Valley. The dataset was built from scratch by engaging native speakers to write and validate culturally relevant questions for their respective countries. ArabCulture spans 12 daily life domains with 54 fine-grained subtopics, reflecting various aspects of social norms, traditions, and everyday experiences. Zero-shot evaluations show that open-weight language models with up to 32B parameters struggle to comprehend diverse Arab cultures, with performance varying across regions. These findings highlight the need for more culturally aware models and datasets tailored to the Arabic-speaking world.

  Synthetic high-quality multi-step reasoning data can significantly enhance the performance of large language models on various tasks. However, most existing methods rely on rejection sampling, which generates trajectories independently and suffers from inefficiency and imbalanced sampling across problems of varying difficulty. In this work, we introduce FastMCTS, an innovative data synthesis strategy inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search. FastMCTS provides a more efficient sampling method for multi-step reasoning data, offering step-level evaluation signals and promoting balanced sampling across problems of different difficulty levels. Experiments on both English and Chinese reasoning datasets demonstrate that FastMCTS generates over 30\% more correct reasoning paths compared to rejection sampling as the number of generated tokens scales up. Furthermore, under comparable synthetic data budgets, models trained on FastMCTS-generated data outperform those trained on rejection sampling data by 3.9\% across multiple benchmarks. As a lightweight sampling strategy, FastMCTS offers a practical and efficient alternative for synthesizing high-quality reasoning data. Our code will be released soon.

  Tokenization is a fundamental preprocessing step in NLP, directly impacting large language models' (LLMs) ability to capture syntactic, morphosyntactic, and semantic structures. This paper introduces a novel framework for systematically evaluating tokenization strategies, addressing challenges in morphologically rich and low-resource languages. Using a Turkish dataset of 6,200 multiple-choice questions from the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark, the framework assesses tokenizers across five key metrics: vocabulary size, token count, processing time, language-specific token percentages (\%TR), and token purity. These metrics provide a structured approach to evaluating how well tokenizers preserve linguistic structures. While \%TR measures the proportion of valid words in the target language, \%Pure assesses the alignment of tokens with meaningful linguistic units, such as roots and valid morphemes, minimizing semantic fragmentation. The findings reveal that \%TR, introduced as a critical metric, exhibits a stronger correlation with downstream performance (e.g., MMLU scores) than token purity, emphasizing its role in improving model accuracy. Additionally, larger model parameters do not necessarily yield better tokenization quality or enhanced results, highlighting the importance of tailored tokenization strategies that prioritize linguistic alignment. This framework sets a new standard for developing robust tokenization methods optimized for morphologically complex and low-resource languages. Future work will refine morphological analysis, explore domain-specific customizations, and conduct cross-linguistic evaluations to further enhance tokenization practices.

  As chatbots become integral to daily life, personalizing systems is key for fostering trust, engagement, and inclusivity. This study examines how linguistic similarity affects chatbot performance, focusing on integrating African American English (AAE) into virtual agents to better serve the African American community. We develop text-based and spoken chatbots using large language models and text-to-speech technology, then evaluate them with AAE speakers against standard English chatbots. Our results show that while text-based AAE chatbots often underperform, spoken chatbots benefit from an African American voice and AAE elements, improving performance and preference. These findings underscore the complexities of linguistic personalization and the dynamics between text and speech modalities, highlighting technological limitations that affect chatbots' AA speech generation and pointing to promising future research directions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems show remarkable potential as question answering tools in the K-12 Education domain, where knowledge is typically queried within the restricted scope of authoritative textbooks. However, discrepancies between these textbooks and the parametric knowledge inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) can undermine the effectiveness of RAG systems. To systematically investigate RAG system robustness against such knowledge discrepancies, we introduce KnowShiftQA. This novel question answering dataset simulates these discrepancies by applying deliberate hypothetical knowledge updates to both answers and source documents, reflecting how textbook knowledge can shift. KnowShiftQA comprises 3,005 questions across five subjects, designed with a comprehensive question typology focusing on context utilization and knowledge integration. Our extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering performance reveal that most RAG systems suffer a substantial performance drop when faced with these knowledge discrepancies. Furthermore, questions requiring the integration of contextual (textbook) knowledge with parametric (LLM) knowledge pose a significant challenge to current LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Question answering represents a core capability of large language models (LLMs). However, when individuals encounter unfamiliar knowledge in texts, they often formulate questions that the text itself cannot answer due to insufficient understanding of the underlying information. Recent studies reveal that while LLMs can detect unanswerable questions, they struggle to assist users in reformulating these questions. Even advanced models like GPT-3.5 demonstrate limited effectiveness in this regard. To address this limitation, we propose DRS: Deep Question Reformulation with Structured Output, a novel zero-shot method aimed at enhancing LLMs ability to assist users in reformulating questions to extract relevant information from new documents. DRS combines the strengths of LLMs with a DFS-based algorithm to iteratively explore potential entity combinations and constrain outputs using predefined entities. This structured approach significantly enhances the reformulation capabilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that DRS improves the reformulation accuracy of GPT-3.5 from 23.03% to 70.42%, while also enhancing the performance of open-source models, such as Gemma2-9B, from 26.35% to 56.75%.

  Vertical text input is commonly encountered in various real-world applications, such as mathematical computations and word-based Sudoku puzzles. While current large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural language tasks, they remain vulnerable to variations in text formatting. Recent research demonstrates that modifying input formats, such as vertically aligning words for encoder-based models, can substantially lower accuracy in text classification tasks. While easily understood by humans, these inputs can significantly mislead models, posing a potential risk of bypassing detection in real-world scenarios involving harmful or sensitive information. With the expanding application of LLMs, a crucial question arises: \textit{Do decoder-based LLMs exhibit similar vulnerabilities to vertically formatted text input?} In this paper, we investigate the impact of vertical text input on the performance of various LLMs across multiple text classification datasets and analyze the underlying causes. Our findings are as follows: (i) Vertical text input significantly degrades the accuracy of LLMs in text classification tasks. (ii) \textit{Chain of Thought (CoT)} reasoning does not help LLMs recognize vertical input or mitigate its vulnerability, but \textit{few-shot learning} with careful analysis does. (iii) We explore the underlying cause of the vulnerability by analyzing the inherent issues in tokenization and attention matrices.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To broaden the dissemination of scientific knowledge to diverse audiences, it is desirable for scientific document summarization systems to simultaneously control multiple attributes such as length and empirical focus. However, existing research typically focuses on controlling single attributes, leaving the compositional control of multiple attributes underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce CCSBench, the first evaluation benchmark for compositional controllable summarization in the scientific domain. Our benchmark enables fine-grained control over both explicit attributes (e.g., length), which are objective and straightforward, and implicit attributes (e.g., conceptual or empirical focus), which are more subjective and abstract. We conduct extensive experiments using various large language models (LLMs) under various settings, including in-context learning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and two-stage modular methods for balancing control over different attributes. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs capabilities in balancing trade-offs between control attributes, especially implicit ones that require deeper understanding and abstract reasoning.

  Vision Language Models (VLMs) extend remarkable capabilities of text-only large language models and vision-only models, and are able to learn from and process multi-modal vision-text input. While modern VLMs perform well on a number of standard image classification and image-text matching tasks, they still struggle with a number of crucial vision-language (VL) reasoning abilities such as counting and spatial reasoning. Moreover, while they might be very brittle to small variations in instructions and/or evaluation protocols, existing benchmarks fail to evaluate their robustness (or rather the lack of it). In order to couple challenging VL scenarios with comprehensive robustness evaluation, we introduce DARE, Diverse Visual Question Answering with Robustness Evaluation, a carefully created and curated multiple-choice VQA benchmark. DARE evaluates VLM performance on five diverse categories and includes four robustness-oriented evaluations based on the variations of: prompts, the subsets of answer options, the output format and the number of correct answers. Among a spectrum of other findings, we report that state-of-the-art VLMs still struggle with questions in most categories and are unable to consistently deliver their peak performance across the tested robustness evaluations. The worst case performance across the subsets of options is up to 34% below the performance in the standard case. The robustness of the open-source VLMs such as LLaVA 1.6 and Idefics2 cannot match the closed-source models such as GPT-4 and Gemini, but even the latter remain very brittle to different variations.

  Creating an immersive and interactive theatrical experience is a long-term goal in the field of interactive narrative. The emergence of large language model (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing LLM-based drama generation methods often result in AI agents that lack initiative and cannot interact with the physical environment. Furthermore, these methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These limitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time performance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent framework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple topic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent improvisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given an autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based on their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to conversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of scene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon. The change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know and care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the quality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three primary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and interaction experience. The experimental evaluation shows that HAMLET can create expressive and coherent theatrical experiences. Our code, dataset and models are available atthis https URL.

  The injection molding industry faces critical challenges in preserving and transferring field knowledge, particularly as experienced workers retire and multilingual barriers hinder effective communication. This study introduces IM-Chat, a multi-agent framework based on large language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate knowledge transfer in injection molding. IM-Chat integrates both limited documented knowledge (e.g., troubleshooting tables, manuals) and extensive field data modeled through a data-driven process condition generator that infers optimal manufacturing settings from environmental inputs such as temperature and humidity, enabling robust and context-aware task resolution. By adopting a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy and tool-calling agents within a modular architecture, IM-Chat ensures adaptability without the need for fine-tuning. Performance was assessed across 100 single-tool and 60 hybrid tasks for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-3.5-turbo by domain experts using a 10-point rubric focused on relevance and correctness, and was further supplemented by automated evaluation using GPT-4o guided by a domain-adapted instruction prompt. The evaluation results indicate that more capable models tend to achieve higher accuracy, particularly in complex, tool-integrated scenarios. Overall, these findings demonstrate the viability of multi-agent LLM systems for industrial knowledge workflows and establish IM-Chat as a scalable and generalizable approach to AI-assisted decision support in manufacturing.

  General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in intelligence, performing comparably to human experts on complex reasoning tasks such as coding and mathematical reasoning. However, generating formal proofs in specialized languages like Lean 4 remains a significant challenge for these models, limiting their application in complex theorem proving and automated verification. Current approaches typically require specializing models through fine-tuning on dedicated formal corpora, incurring high costs for data collection and training. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Delta Prover}, an agent-based framework that orchestrates the interaction between a general-purpose LLM and the Lean 4 proof environment. Delta Prover leverages the reflection and reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs to interactively construct formal proofs in Lean 4, circumventing the need for model specialization. At its core, the agent integrates two novel, interdependent components: an algorithmic framework for reflective decomposition and iterative proof repair, and a custom Domain-Specific Language (DSL) built upon Lean 4 for streamlined subproblem management. \textbf{Delta Prover achieves a state-of-the-art 95.9\% success rate on the miniF2F-test benchmark, surpassing all existing approaches, including those requiring model specialization.} Furthermore, Delta Prover exhibits a significantly stronger test-time scaling law compared to standard Best-of-N proof strategies. Crucially, our findings demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs, when guided by an effective agentic structure, possess substantial untapped theorem-proving capabilities. This presents a computationally efficient alternative to specialized models for robust automated reasoning in formal environments.

  This paper presents the Coordinate Heart System (CHS), a geometric framework for emotion representation in artificial intelligence applications. We position eight core emotions as coordinates on a unit circle, enabling mathematical computation of complex emotional states through coordinate mixing and vector operations. Our initial five-emotion model revealed significant coverage gaps in the emotion space, leading to the development of an eight-emotion system that provides complete geometric coverage with mathematical guarantees. The framework converts natural language input to emotion coordinates and supports real-time emotion interpolation through computational algorithms. The system introduces a re-calibrated stability parameter S in [0,1], which dynamically integrates emotional load, conflict resolution, and contextual drain factors. This stability model leverages advanced Large Language Model interpretation of textual cues and incorporates hybrid temporal tracking mechanisms to provide nuanced assessment of psychological well-being states. Our key contributions include: (i) mathematical proof demonstrating why five emotions are insufficient for complete geometric coverage, (ii) an eight-coordinate system that eliminates representational blind spots, (iii) novel algorithms for emotion mixing, conflict resolution, and distance calculation in emotion space, and (iv) a comprehensive computational framework for AI emotion recognition with enhanced multi-dimensional stability modeling. Experimental validation through case studies demonstrates the system's capability to handle emotionally conflicted states, contextual distress factors, and complex psychological scenarios that traditional categorical emotion models cannot adequately represent. This work establishes a new mathematical foundation for emotion modeling in artificial intelligence systems.

  Recently, inspired by OpenAI-o1/o3 and Deepseek-R1, the R1-Style method based on reinforcement learning fine-tuning has received widespread attention from the community. Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning and code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their advantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal data type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in complex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain vision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex chart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic data synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning data covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of reasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training strategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and Chart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims to decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable subtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for improving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the typical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft reward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity in the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks and self-built chart reasoning dataset (\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}). Experimental results show that Chart-R1 has significant advantages compared to chart-domain methods, even comparable to open/closed source large-scale models (\emph{e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-3.5}).

  Non-destructive testing (NDT), particularly X-ray inspection, is vital for industrial quality assurance, yet existing deep-learning-based approaches often lack interactivity, interpretability, and the capacity for critical self-assessment, limiting their reliability and operator trust. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based agentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive X-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent positions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator, coordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect region proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in X-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides the LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating context assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination, confidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the SDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using tools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning, enhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate diverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset demonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection F1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and trustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of agentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.

  The rapid development of autonomous web agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), while greatly elevating efficiency, exposes the frontier risk of taking unintended or harmful actions. This situation underscores an urgent need for effective safety measures, akin to access controls for human users. To address this critical challenge, we introduce WebGuard, the first comprehensive dataset designed to support the assessment of web agent action risks and facilitate the development of guardrails for real-world online environments. In doing so, WebGuard specifically focuses on predicting the outcome of state-changing actions and contains 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193 websites across 22 diverse domains, including often-overlooked long-tail websites. These actions are categorized using a novel three-tier risk schema: SAFE, LOW, and HIGH. The dataset includes designated training and test splits to support evaluation under diverse generalization settings. Our initial evaluations reveal a concerning deficiency: even frontier LLMs achieve less than 60% accuracy in predicting action outcomes and less than 60% recall in lagging HIGH-risk actions, highlighting the risks of deploying current-generation agents without dedicated safeguards. We therefore investigate fine-tuning specialized guardrail models using WebGuard. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple generalization settings and find that a fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-7B model yields a substantial improvement in performance, boosting accuracy from 37% to 80% and HIGH-risk action recall from 20% to 76%. Despite these improvements, the performance still falls short of the reliability required for high-stakes deployment, where guardrails must approach near-perfect accuracy and recall.

  Text-to-image generative models like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion have revolutionized visual content creation across various applications, including advertising, personalized media, and design prototyping. However, crafting effective textual prompts to guide these models remains challenging, often requiring extensive trial and error. Existing prompt inversion approaches, such as soft and hard prompt techniques, are not so effective due to the limited interpretability and incoherent prompt generation. To address these issues, we propose Visually Guided Decoding (VGD), a gradient-free approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) and CLIP-based guidance to generate coherent and semantically aligned prompts. In essence, VGD utilizes the robust text generation capabilities of LLMs to produce human-readable prompts. Further, by employing CLIP scores to ensure alignment with user-specified visual concepts, VGD enhances the interpretability, generalization, and flexibility of prompt generation without the need for additional training. Our experiments demonstrate that VGD outperforms existing prompt inversion techniques in generating understandable and contextually relevant prompts, facilitating more intuitive and controllable interactions with text-to-image models.

  The deployment of agent systems in an enterprise environment is often hindered by several challenges: common models lack domain-specific process knowledge, leading to disorganized plans, missing key tools, and poor execution stability. To address this, this paper introduces Routine, a multi-step agent planning framework designed with a clear structure, explicit instructions, and seamless parameter passing to guide the agent's execution module in performing multi-step tool-calling tasks with high stability. In evaluations conducted within a real-world enterprise scenario, Routine significantly increases the execution accuracy in model tool calls, increasing the performance of GPT-4o from 41.1% to 96.3%, and Qwen3-14B from 32.6% to 83.3%. We further constructed a Routine-following training dataset and fine-tuned Qwen3-14B, resulting in an accuracy increase to 88.2% on scenario-specific evaluations, indicating improved adherence to execution plans. In addition, we employed Routine-based distillation to create a scenario-specific, multi-step tool-calling dataset. Fine-tuning on this distilled dataset raised the model's accuracy to 95.5%, approaching GPT-4o's performance. These results highlight Routine's effectiveness in distilling domain-specific tool-usage patterns and enhancing model adaptability to new scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that Routine provides a practical and accessible approach to building stable agent workflows, accelerating the deployment and adoption of agent systems in enterprise environments, and advancing the technical vision of AI for Process.

  Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly relies on multi-agent architectures that blend visual and language understanding. Yet, a pressing challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II) fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops. Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI. This blueprint is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other trust-critical domains.

  Temporal reasoning is pivotal for Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend the real world. However, existing works neglect the real-world challenges for temporal reasoning: (1) intensive temporal information, (2) fast-changing event dynamics, and (3) complex temporal dependencies in social interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-level benchmark TIME, designed for temporal reasoning in real-world scenarios. TIME consists of 38,522 QA pairs, covering 3 levels with 11 fine-grained sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses 3 sub-datasets reflecting different real-world challenges: TIME-Wiki, TIME-News, and TIME-Dial. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning models and non-reasoning models. And we conducted an in-depth analysis of temporal reasoning performance across diverse real-world scenarios and tasks, and summarized the impact of test-time scaling on temporal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we release TIME-Lite, a human-annotated subset to foster future research and standardized evaluation in temporal reasoning. The code is available atthis https URL, and the dataset is available atthis https URL.

  _Fengxiang Cheng, Haoxuan Li, Fenrong Liu, Robert van Rooij, Kun Zhang, Zhouchen Lin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes on various tasks. However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs, which can be categorized into the following two aspects: (1) Logical question answering: LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within a complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises. (2) Logical consistency: LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art question-answering LLM Macaw, answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose a detailed taxonomy. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistencies, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extending to modal logic to account for uncertainty and developing efficient algorithms that simultaneously satisfy multiple logical consistencies.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems, i.e. interconnected elements that include an LLM as a central component, such as conversational agents, are usually designed with monolithic, static architectures that rely on a single, general-purpose LLM to handle all user queries. However, these systems may be inefficient as different queries may require different levels of reasoning, domain knowledge or pre-processing. While generalist LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet) perform well across a wide range of tasks, they may incur significant financial, energy and computational costs. These costs may be disproportionate for simpler queries, resulting in unnecessary resource utilisation. A routing mechanism can therefore be employed to route queries to more appropriate components, such as smaller or specialised models, thereby improving efficiency and optimising resource consumption. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of routing strategies in LLM-based systems. Specifically, it reviews when, why, and how routing should be integrated into LLM pipelines to improve efficiency, scalability, and performance. We define the objectives to optimise, such as cost minimisation and performance maximisation, and discuss the timing of routing within the LLM workflow, whether it occurs before or after generation. We also detail the various implementation strategies, including similarity-based, supervised, reinforcement learning-based, and generative methods. Practical considerations such as industrial applications and current limitations are also examined, like standardising routing experiments, accounting for non-financial costs, and designing adaptive strategies. By formalising routing as a performance-cost optimisation problem, this survey provides tools and directions to guide future research and development of adaptive low-cost LLM-based systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, they exhibit certain cognitive patterns similar to those of humans that are not directly specified in training data. This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on temporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find that larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference point and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance logarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To uncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses across neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify a set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits minimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a logarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing representations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where years evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal orientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we found that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear temporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal construction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for understanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a subjective construction of the external world by its internal representational system. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien cognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a direction for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rise of service computing, cloud computing, and IoT, service ecosystems are becoming increasingly complex. The intricate interactions among intelligent agents make abnormal emergence analysis challenging, as traditional causal methods focus on individual trajectories. Large language models offer new possibilities for Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to reveal agent intentions. However, existing approaches remain limited to microscopic and static analysis. This paper introduces a framework: Emergence Analysis based on Multi-Agent Intention (EAMI), which enables dynamic and interpretable emergence analysis. EAMI first employs a dual-perspective thought track mechanism, where an Inspector Agent and an Analysis Agent extract agent intentions under bounded and perfect rationality. Then, k-means clustering identifies phase transition points in group intentions, followed by a Intention Temporal Emergence diagram for dynamic analysis. The experiments validate EAMI in complex online-to-offline (O2O) service system and the Stanford AI Town experiment, with ablation studies confirming its effectiveness, generalizability, and efficiency. This framework provides a novel paradigm for abnormal emergence and causal analysis in service ecosystems. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Smart contracts are trustworthy, immutable, and automatically executed programs on the blockchain. Their execution requires the Gas mechanism to ensure efficiency and fairness. However, due to non-optimal coding practices, many contracts contain Gas waste patterns that need to be optimized. Existing solutions mostly rely on manual discovery, which is inefficient, costly to maintain, and difficult to scale. Recent research uses large language models (LLMs) to explore new Gas waste patterns. However, it struggles to remain compatible with existing patterns, often produces redundant patterns, and requires manual validation/rewriting. To address this gap, we present GasAgent, the first multi-agent system for smart contract Gas optimization that combines compatibility with existing patterns and automated discovery/validation of new patterns, enabling end-to-end optimization. GasAgent consists of four specialized agents, Seeker, Innovator, Executor, and Manager, that collaborate in a closed loop to identify, validate, and apply Gas-saving improvements. Experiments on 100 verified real-world contracts demonstrate that GasAgent successfully optimizes 82 contracts, achieving an average deployment Gas savings of 9.97%. In addition, our evaluation confirms its compatibility with existing tools and validates the effectiveness of each module through ablation studies. To assess broader usability, we further evaluate 500 contracts generated by five representative LLMs across 10 categories and find that GasAgent optimizes 79.8% of them, with deployment Gas savings ranging from 4.79% to 13.93%, showing its usability as the optimization layer for LLM-assisted smart contract development.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) has become a standard for assessing LLM capabilities efficiently. A variety of metrics can be employed for this task. However, previous research has not conducted a thorough assessment of them. At the same time, MCQ evaluation suffers from answer fluctuation: models produce different results given slight changes in prompts. We suggest a metric assessment protocol in which evaluation methodologies are analyzed through their connection with fluctuation rates, as well as original performance. Our results show that there is a strong link between existing metrics and the answer changing, even when computed without any additional prompt variants. A novel metric, worst accuracy, demonstrates the highest association on the protocol.

  _Cole Robertson, Philip Wolff_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Do large language models (LLMs) construct and manipulate internal world models, or do they rely solely on statistical associations represented as output layer token probabilities? We adapt cognitive science methodologies from human mental models research to test LLMs on pulley system problems using TikZ-rendered stimuli. Study 1 examines whether LLMs can estimate mechanical advantage (MA). State-of-the-art models performed marginally but significantly above chance, and their estimates correlated significantly with ground-truth MA. Significant correlations between number of pulleys and model estimates suggest that models employed a pulley counting heuristic, without necessarily simulating pulley systems to derive precise values. Study 2 tested this by probing whether LLMs represent global features crucial to MA estimation. Models evaluated a functionally connected pulley system against a fake system with randomly placed components. Without explicit cues, models identified the functional system as having greater MA with F1=0.8, suggesting LLMs could represent systems well enough to differentiate jumbled from functional systems. Study 3 built on this by asking LLMs to compare functional systems with matched systems which were connected up but which transferred no force to the weight; LLMs identified the functional system with F1=0.46, suggesting random guessing. Insofar as they may generalize, these findings are compatible with the notion that LLMs manipulate internal world models, sufficient to exploit statistical associations between pulley count and MA (Study 1), and to approximately represent system components' spatial relations (Study 2). However, they may lack the facility to reason over nuanced structural connectivity (Study 3). We conclude by advocating the utility of cognitive scientific methods to evaluate the world-modeling capacities of artificial intelligence systems.

  The global ageing population necessitates new and emerging strategies for caring for older adults. In this article, we explore the potential for transformation in elderly care through Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We discuss the proactive and autonomous decision-making facilitated by Agentic AI in elderly care. Personalized tracking of health, cognitive care, and environmental management, all aimed at enhancing independence and high-level living for older adults, represents important areas of application. With a potential for significant transformation of elderly care, Agentic AI also raises profound concerns about data privacy and security, decision independence, and access. We share key insights to emphasize the need for ethical safeguards, privacy protections, and transparent decision-making. Our goal in this article is to provide a balanced discussion of both the potential and the challenges associated with Agentic AI, and to provide insights into its responsible use in elderly care, to bring Agentic AI into harmony with the requirements and vulnerabilities specific to the elderly. Finally, we identify the priorities for the academic research communities, to achieve human-centered advancements and integration of Agentic AI in elderly care. To the best of our knowledge, this is no existing study that reviews the role of Agentic AI in elderly care. Hence, we address the literature gap by analyzing the unique capabilities, applications, and limitations of LLM-based Agentic AI in elderly care. We also provide a companion interactive dashboard atthis https URL.

  The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract context from natural language problem descriptions naturally raises questions about their suitability in autonomous decision-making settings. This paper studies the behaviour of these models within a Markov Decision Process (MDPs). While traditional reinforcement learning (RL) strategies commonly employed in this setting rely on iterative exploration, LLMs, pre-trained on diverse datasets, offer the capability to leverage prior knowledge for faster adaptation. We investigate online structured prompting strategies in sequential decision making tasks, comparing the zero-shot performance of LLM-based approaches to that of classical RL methods. Our findings reveal that although LLMs demonstrate improved initial performance in simpler environments, they struggle with planning and reasoning in complex scenarios without fine-tuning or additional guidance. Our results show that feedback mechanisms, intended to improve decision-making, often introduce confusion, leading to diminished performance in intricate environments. These insights underscore the need for further exploration into hybrid strategies, fine-tuning, and advanced memory integration to enhance LLM-based decision-making capabilities.

  Generative AI, large language models, and agentic AI have emerged separately of urban planning. However, the convergence between AI and urban planning presents an interesting opportunity towards AI urban planners. This paper conceptualizes urban planning as a generative AI task, where AI synthesizes land-use configurations under geospatial, social, and human-centric constraints. We survey how generative AI approaches, including VAEs, GANs, transformers, and diffusion models, reshape urban design. We further identify critical gaps: 1) limited research on integrating urban theory guidance, 2) limited research of AI urban planning over multiple spatial resolutions or angularities, 3) limited research on augmenting urban design knowledge from data, and 4) limited research on addressing real-world interactions. To address these limitations, we outline future research directions in theory-guided generation, digital twins, and human-machine co-design, calling for a new synthesis of generative intelligence and participatory urbanism.

  As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications, scalable and rigorous safety evaluation is essential. This paper introduces Aymara AI, a programmatic platform for generating and administering customized, policy-grounded safety evaluations. Aymara AI transforms natural-language safety policies into adversarial prompts and scores model responses using an AI-based rater validated against human judgments. We demonstrate its capabilities through the Aymara LLM Risk and Responsibility Matrix, which evaluates 20 commercially available LLMs across 10 real-world safety domains. Results reveal wide performance disparities, with mean safety scores ranging from 86.2% to 52.4%. While models performed well in well-established safety domains such as Misinformation (mean = 95.7%), they consistently failed in more complex or underspecified domains, notably Privacy & Impersonation (mean = 24.3%). Analyses of Variance confirmed that safety scores differed significantly across both models and domains (p < .05). These findings underscore the inconsistent and context-dependent nature of LLM safety and highlight the need for scalable, customizable tools like Aymara AI to support responsible AI development and oversight.

  Large-language-model (LLM) agents exhibit complex, context-sensitive behaviour that quickly renders static benchmarks and ad-hoc manual testing obsolete.We present Neo, a configurable, multi-agent framework that automates realistic, multi-turn evaluation of LLM-based systems. Neo couples a Question Generation Agent and an Evaluation Agent through a shared context-hub, allowing domain prompts, scenario controls and dynamic feedback to be composed modularly. Test inputs are sampled from a probabilistic state model spanning dialogue flow, user intent and emotional tone, enabling diverse, human-like conversations that adapt after every turn.Applied to a production-grade Seller Financial Assistant chatbot, Neo (i) uncovered edge-case failures across five attack categories with a 3.3% break rate close to the 5.8% achieved by expert human red-teamers, and (ii) delivered 10-12X higher throughput, generating 180 coherent test questions in around 45 mins versus 16h of human effort. Beyond security probing, Neo's stochastic policies balanced topic coverage and conversational depth, yielding broader behavioural exploration than manually crafted scripts.Neo therefore lays a foundation for scalable, self-evolving LLM QA: its agent interfaces, state controller and feedback loops are model-agnostic and extensible to richer factual-grounding and policy-compliance checks. We release the framework to facilitate reproducible, high-fidelity testing of emerging agentic systems.

  Language models have become increasingly powerful tools for formal mathematical reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely exclusively on either large general-purpose models or smaller specialized models, each with distinct limitations, while training specialized large models still requires significant computational resources. This paper introduces ProofCompass, a novel hybrid methodology that achieves remarkable computational efficiency by strategically guiding existing specialized prover methods, such as DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5-RL (DSP-v1.5) with a Large Language Model (LLM) without requiring additional model training. The LLM provides natural language proof strategies and analyzes failed attempts to select intermediate lemmas, enabling effective problem decomposition. On the miniF2F benchmark, ProofCompass demonstrates substantial resource efficiency: it outperforms DSP-v1.5 ($54.9\% \rightarrow 55.3\%$) while using 25x fewer attempts ($3200 \rightarrow 128$). Our synergistic approach paves the way for simultaneously improving computational efficiency and accuracy in formal theorem proving.

  Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often suffer from an extreme long-tail distribution of dialogue data, causing a strong bias toward head-frequency blockbusters that sacrifices diversity and exacerbates the cold-start problem. An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL corpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all mentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention. This imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body representation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose LumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through three mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss (ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head over-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail Recommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to guide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a GPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically generates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity and distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly improve recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and INSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over fifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency, informativeness, and long-tail relevance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-layer collaboration in building an efficient and fair long-tail conversational recommender.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are accelerating scientific idea generation, but rigorously evaluating these numerous, often superficial, AI-generated propositions for novelty and factual accuracy is a critical bottleneck; manual verification is too slow. Existing validation methods are inadequate: LLMs as standalone verifiers may hallucinate and lack domain knowledge (our findings show 60% unawareness of relevant papers in specific domains), while traditional citation networks lack explicit causality and narrative surveys are unstructured. This underscores a core challenge: the absence of structured, verifiable, and causally-linked historical data of scientificthis http URLaddress this,we introduce \textbf{THE-Tree} (\textbf{T}echnology \textbf{H}istory \textbf{E}volution Tree), a computational framework that constructs such domain-specific evolution trees from scientific literature. THE-Tree employs a search algorithm to explore evolutionary paths. During its node expansion, it utilizes a novel "Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify" process: an LLM proposes potential advancements and cites supporting literature. Critically, each proposed evolutionary link is then validated for logical coherence and evidential support by a recovered natural language inference mechanism that interrogates the cited literature, ensuring that each step is grounded. We construct and validate 88 THE-Trees across diverse domains and release a benchmark dataset including up to 71k fact verifications covering 27k papers to foster further research. Experiments demonstrate that i) in graph completion, our THE-Tree improves hit@1 by 8% to 14% across multiple models compared to traditional citation networks; ii) for predicting future scientific developments, it improves hit@1 metric by nearly 10%; and iii) when combined with other methods, it boosts the performance of evaluating important scientific papers by almost 100%.

  This paper introduces Agent-Based Auto Research, a structured multi-agent framework designed to automate, coordinate, and optimize the full lifecycle of scientific research. Leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and modular agent collaboration, the system spans all major research phases, including literature review, ideation, methodology planning, experimentation, paper writing, peer review response, and dissemination. By addressing issues such as fragmented workflows, uneven methodological expertise, and cognitive overload, the framework offers a systematic and scalable approach to scientific inquiry. Preliminary explorations demonstrate the feasibility and potential of Auto Research as a promising paradigm for self-improving, AI-driven research processes.

  In the developer community for large language models (LLMs), there is not yet a clean pattern analogous to a software library, to support very large scale collaboration. Even for the commonplace use case of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it is not currently possible to write a RAG application against a well-defined set of APIs that are agreed upon by different LLM providers. Inspired by the idea of compiler intrinsics, we propose some elements of such a concept through introducing a library of LLM Intrinsics for RAG. An LLM intrinsic is defined as a capability that can be invoked through a well-defined API that is reasonably stable and independent of how the LLM intrinsic itself is implemented. The intrinsics in our library are released as LoRA adapters on HuggingFace, and through a software interface with clear structured input/output characteristics on top of vLLM as an inference platform, accompanied in both places with documentation and code. This article describes the intended usage, training details, and evaluations for each intrinsic, as well as compositions of multiple intrinsics.

  This study introduces a LLMs powered multiagent ensemble method to address challenges in hallucination and data labeling, particularly in large-scale EHR datasets. Manual labeling of such datasets requires domain expertise and is labor-intensive, time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. To overcome this bottleneck, we developed an ensemble LLMs method and demonstrated its effectiveness in two real-world tasks: (1) labeling a large-scale unlabeled ECG dataset in MIMIC-IV; (2) identifying social determinants of health (SDOH) from the clinical notes of EHR. Trading off benefits and cost, we selected a pool of diverse open source LLMs with satisfactory performance. We treat each LLM's prediction as a vote and apply a mechanism of majority voting with minimal winning threshold for ensemble. We implemented an ensemble LLMs application for EHR data labeling tasks. By using the ensemble LLMs and natural language processing, we labeled MIMIC-IV ECG dataset of 623,566 ECG reports with an estimated accuracy of 98.2%. We applied the ensemble LLMs method to identify SDOH from social history sections of 1,405 EHR clinical notes, also achieving competitive performance. Our experiments show that the ensemble LLMs can outperform individual LLM even the best commercial one, and the method reduces hallucination errors. From the research, we found that (1) the ensemble LLMs method significantly reduces the time and effort required for labeling large-scale EHR data, automating the process with high accuracy and quality; (2) the method generalizes well to other text data labeling tasks, as shown by its application to SDOH identification; (3) the ensemble of a group of diverse LLMs can outperform or match the performance of the best individual LLM; and (4) the ensemble method substantially reduces hallucination errors. This approach provides a scalable and efficient solution to data-labeling challenges.

  The development of autonomous agents increasingly relies on Multimodal Language Models (MLMs) to perform tasks described in natural language with GUI environments, such as websites, desktop computers, or mobile phones. Existing benchmarks for MLM agents in interactive environments are limited by their focus on a single environment, lack of detailed and generalized evaluation methods, and the complexities of constructing tasks and evaluators. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Crab, the first agent benchmark framework designed to support cross-environment tasks, incorporating a graph-based fine-grained evaluation method and an efficient mechanism for task and evaluator construction. Our framework supports multiple devices and can be easily extended to any environment with a Python interface. Leveraging Crab, we developed a cross-platform Crab Benchmark-v0 comprising 120 tasks in computer desktop and mobile phone environments. We evaluated four advanced MLMs using different single and multi-agent system configurations on this benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that the single agent with GPT-4o achieves the best completion ratio of 38.01%. All framework code, agent code, and task datasets are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Forests are crucial for ecological balance, but wildfires, a major cause of forest loss, pose significant risks. Fire weather indices, which assess wildfire risk and predict resource demands, are vital. With the rise of sensor networks in fields like healthcare and environmental monitoring, semantic sensor networks are increasingly used to gather climatic data such as wind speed, temperature, and humidity. However, processing these data streams to determine fire weather indices presents challenges, underscoring the growing importance of effective forest fire detection. This paper discusses using Apache Spark for early forest fire detection, enhancing fire risk prediction with meteorological and geographical data. Building on our previous development of Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontologies and Semantic Web Rules Language (SWRL) for managing forest fires in Monesterial Natural Park, we expanded SWRL to improve a Decision Support System (DSS) using a Large Language Models (LLMs) and Spark framework. We implemented real-time alerts with Spark streaming, tailored to various fire scenarios, and validated our approach using ontology metrics, query-based evaluations, LLMs score precision, F1 score, and recall measures.
