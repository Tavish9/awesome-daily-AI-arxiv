  Existing learning-based autonomous driving (AD) systems face challenges in comprehending high-level information, generalizing to rare events, and providing interpretability. To address these problems, this work employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as a decision-making component for complex AD scenarios that require human commonsense understanding. We devise cognitive pathways to enable comprehensive reasoning with LLMs, and develop algorithms for translating LLM decisions into actionable driving commands. Through this approach, LLM decisions are seamlessly integrated with low-level controllers by guided parameter matrix adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method not only consistently surpasses baseline approaches in single-vehicle tasks, but also helps handle complex driving behaviors even multi-vehicle coordination, thanks to the commonsense reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This paper presents an initial step toward leveraging LLMs as effective decision-makers for intricate AD scenarios in terms of safety, efficiency, generalizability, and interoperability. We aspire for it to serve as inspiration for future research in this field. Project page:this https URL

  Autonomous systems deployed on edge devices face significant challenges, including resource constraints, real-time processing demands, and adapting to dynamic environments. This work introduces ATLASv2, a novel system that integrates a fine-tuned TinyLLM, real-time object detection, and efficient path planning to enable hierarchical, multi-task navigation and manipulation all on the edge device, Jetson Nano. ATLASv2 dynamically expands its navigable landmarks by detecting and localizing objects in the environment which are saved to its internal knowledge base to be used for future task execution. We evaluate ATLASv2 in real-world environments, including a handcrafted home and office setting constructed with diverse objects and landmarks. Results show that ATLASv2 effectively interprets natural language instructions, decomposes them into low-level actions, and executes tasks with high success rates. By leveraging generative AI in a fully on-board framework, ATLASv2 achieves optimized resource utilization with minimal prompting latency and power consumption, bridging the gap between simulated environments and real-world applications.

  Because large language models are expensive to pretrain on different datasets, using smaller-scale experiments to decide on data is crucial for reducing costs. Which benchmarks and methods of making decisions from observed performance at small scale most accurately predict the datasets that yield the best large models? To empower open exploration of this question, we release models, data, and evaluations in DataDecide -- the most extensive open suite of models over differences in data and scale. We conduct controlled pretraining experiments across 25 corpora with differing sources, deduplication, and filtering up to 100B tokens, model sizes up to 1B parameters, and 3 random seeds. We find that the ranking of models at a single, small size (e.g., 150M parameters) is a strong baseline for predicting best models at our larger target scale (1B) (~80% of com parisons correct). No scaling law methods among 8 baselines exceed the compute-decision frontier of single-scale predictions, but DataDecide can measure improvement in future scaling laws. We also identify that using continuous likelihood metrics as proxies in small experiments makes benchmarks including MMLU, ARC, HellaSwag, MBPP, and HumanEval >80% predictable at the target 1B scale with just 0.01% of the compute.

- **[GPT Meets Graphs and KAN Splines: Testing Novel Frameworks on Multitask Fine-Tuned GPT-2 with LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10490)**  `arXiv:2504.10490`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Gabriel Bo, Marc Bernardino, Justin Gu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We explore the potential of integrating learnable and interpretable modules--specifically Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and graph-based representations--within a pre-trained GPT-2 model to enhance multi-task learning accuracy. Motivated by the recent surge in using KAN and graph attention (GAT) architectures in chain-of-thought (CoT) models and debates over their benefits compared to simpler architectures like MLPs, we begin by enhancing a standard self-attention transformer using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), fine-tuning hyperparameters, and incorporating L2 regularization. This approach yields significant improvements. To further boost interpretability and richer representations, we develop two variants that attempt to improve the standard KAN and GAT: Graph LoRA and Hybrid-KAN LoRA (Learnable GPT). However, systematic evaluations reveal that neither variant outperforms the optimized LoRA-enhanced transformer, which achieves 55.249% accuracy on the SST test set, 99.18% on the CFIMDB dev set, and 89.9% paraphrase detection test accuracy. On sonnet generation, we get a CHRF score of 42.097. These findings highlight that efficient parameter adaptation via LoRA remains the most effective strategy for our tasks: sentiment analysis, paraphrase detection, and sonnet generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Structured pruning is a promising approach to create smaller, faster LLMs. However, existing methods typically rely on backward passes, which can inflate memory requirements and compute costs. In this work we introduce Bonsai, a gradient-free structured pruning method that eliminates the need for backpropagation, significantly reducing memory requirements and compute costs while achieving state-of-the-art pruning performance. Bonsai uses forward-pass-only perturbative pruning to enable efficient compression of large models on a broader range of hardware configurations. Unlike existing structured pruning approaches, Bonsai not only achieves better compression with fewer resources, but also produces models that are twice as fast as those generated by semi-structured pruning. As a concrete demonstration, we use Bonsai to prune an 8B LLaMA-3 model to 50% sparsity on a single A6000 GPU -- a task infeasible with backprop-based methods, which require 2-3x memory. Our results show that removing backprop as a requirement not only enables pruning larger models on constrained hardware but can also lead to state-of-the-art efficiency and performance.

  Leveraging inference-time search in large language models has proven effective in further enhancing a trained model's capability to solve complex mathematical and reasoning problems. However, this approach significantly increases computational costs and inference time, as the model must generate and evaluate multiple candidate solutions to identify a viable reasoning path. To address this, we propose an effective approach that integrates search capabilities directly into the model by fine-tuning it using both successful (learning) and failed reasoning paths (forgetting) derived from diverse search methods. While fine-tuning the model with these data might seem straightforward, we identify a critical issue: the model's search capability tends to degrade rapidly if fine-tuning is performed naively. We show that this degradation can be substantially mitigated by employing a smaller learning rate. Extensive experiments on the challenging Game-of-24 and Countdown mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our approach not only outperforms both standard fine-tuning and inference-time search baselines but also significantly reduces inference time by 180$\times$.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As the post-training of large language models (LLMs) advances from instruction-following to complex reasoning tasks, understanding how different data affect finetuning dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a spectral analysis of layer-wise gradients induced by low/high-quality instruction and reasoning data for LLM post-training. Our analysis reveals that widely-studied metrics for data evaluation, e.g., IFD, InsTag, Difficulty, and Reward, can be explained and unified by spectral properties computed from gradients' singular value decomposition (SVD). Specifically, higher-quality data are usually associated with lower nuclear norms and higher effective ranks. Notably, effective rank exhibits better robustness and resolution than nuclear norm in capturing subtle quality differences. For example, reasoning data achieves substantially higher effective ranks than instruction data, implying richer gradient structures on more complex tasks. Our experiments also highlight that models within the same family share similar gradient patterns regardless of their sizes, whereas different model families diverge significantly. Providing a unified view on the effects of data quality across instruction and reasoning data, this work illuminates the interplay between data quality and training stability, shedding novel insights into developing better data exploration strategies for post-training.

  _Lihong Zhang, Yue Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across organizations without sharing raw data, addressing crucial privacy concerns in healthcare natural language processing (NLP). However, training large language models (LLMs) in federated settings faces significant challenges, including communication overhead and data heterogeneity. We propose Layer-Skipping Federated Learning, where only selected layers of a pre-trained LLM are fine-tuned across clients while others remain frozen. Applied to LLaMA 3.2-1B, our approach reduces communication costs by approximately 70% while maintaining performance within 2% of centralized training. We evaluate our method on clinical NER and classification tasks using i2b2 and MIMIC-III datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that Layer-Skipping FL outperforms competitive baselines, handles non-IID clinical data distributions effectively, and shows robustness when combined with differential privacy. This approach represents a practical solution for privacy-preserving collaborative learning in healthcare NLP.

- **[Teaching Transformers Causal Reasoning through Axiomatic Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07612)**  `arXiv:2407.07612`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For text-based AI systems to interact in the real world, causal reasoning is an essential skill. Since active interventions are costly, we study to what extent a system can learn causal reasoning from symbolic demonstrations of causal axioms. Specifically, we present an axiomatic training method where the system learns from multiple demonstrations of a causal axiom (or rule), rather than incorporating the axiom as an inductive bias or inferring it from data values. A key question is whether the system would learn to generalize from the axiom demonstrations to more complex scenarios. Our results, based on applying axiomatic training to learn the transitivity axiom and d-separation rule, indicate that such generalization is possible. To avoid data contamination issues, we start with a 67 million parameter transformer model and train it from scratch. On both tasks, we find that a model trained on linear causal chains (along with some noisy variations) can generalize well to complex graphs, including longer causal chains, causal chains with reversed order, and graphs withthis http URLhandle diverse text inputs, the same method is extended to finetune language models. Finetuning Llama-3.1 8B model on our axiomatic data leads to significant gains on causal benchmarks such as Corr2Cause and CLEAR, in some cases providing state-of-the-art performance surpassing GPT-4.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Causal discovery traditionally relies on statistical methods applied to observational data, often requiring large datasets and assumptions about underlying causal structures. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced new possibilities for causal discovery by providing domain expert knowledge. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can effectively process observational data for causal discovery. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs for data-driven causal discovery by integrating observational data for LLM-based reasoning. Specifically, we examine whether LLMs can effectively utilize observational data through two prompting strategies: pairwise prompting and breadth first search (BFS)-based prompting. In both approaches, we incorporate the observational data directly into the prompt to assess LLMs' ability to infer causal relationships from such data. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that incorporating observational data enhances causal discovery, boosting F1 scores by up to 0.11 point using both pairwise and BFS LLM-based prompting, while outperforming traditional statistical causal discovery baseline by up to 0.52 points. Our findings highlight the potential and limitations of LLMs for data-driven causal discovery, demonstrating their ability to move beyond textual metadata and effectively interpret and utilize observational data for more informed causal reasoning. Our studies lays the groundwork for future advancements toward fully LLM-driven causal discovery.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large-scale pre-training have shown the potential to learn generalizable representations for downstream tasks. In the graph domain, however, capturing and transferring structural information across different graph domains remains challenging, primarily due to the inherent differences in topological patterns across various contexts. Additionally, most existing models struggle to capture the complexity of rich graph structures, leading to inadequate exploration of the embedding space. To address these challenges, we propose GFSE, a universal graph structural encoder designed to capture transferable structural patterns across diverse domains such as molecular graphs, social networks, and citation networks. GFSE is the first cross-domain graph structural encoder pre-trained with multiple self-supervised learning objectives. Built on a Graph Transformer, GFSE incorporates attention mechanisms informed by graph inductive bias, enabling it to encode intricate multi-level and fine-grained topological features. The pre-trained GFSE produces generic and theoretically expressive positional and structural encoding for graphs, which can be seamlessly integrated with various downstream graph feature encoders, including graph neural networks for vectorized features and Large Language Models for text-attributed graphs. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate GFSE's capability to significantly enhance the model's performance while requiring substantially less task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, GFSE achieves state-of-the-art performance in 81.6% evaluated cases, spanning diverse graph models and datasets, highlighting its potential as a powerful and versatile encoder for graph-structured data.

  Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision to large language models (LLMs), but scaling up training data annotation remains challenging for both humans and LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose an active learning approach, ActPRM, which proactively selects the most uncertain samples for training, substantially reducing labeling costs. During training, we use the PRM to estimate uncertainty after the forward pass, retaining only highly uncertain data. A capable yet costly reasoning model then labels this data. Then we compute the loss with respect to the labels and update the PRM's weights. We compare ActPRM vs. vanilla fine-tuning, on a pool-based active learning setting, demonstrating that ActPRM reduces 50% annotation, but achieving the comparable or even better performance. Beyond annotation efficiency, we further advance the actively trained PRM by filtering over 1M+ math reasoning trajectories with ActPRM, retaining 60% of the data. A subsequent training on this selected dataset yields a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) PRM on ProcessBench (75.0%) and PRMBench (65.5%) compared with same sized models.

  _Feng Chen, Allan Raventos, Nan Cheng, Surya Ganguli, Shaul Druckmann_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights the power of scaling test-time compute to achieve strong performance on complex tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. This raises a critical question: how should model training be modified to optimize performance under a subsequent test-time compute strategy and budget? To explore this, we focus on pass@N, a simple test-time strategy that searches for a correct answer in $N$ independent samples. We show, surprisingly, that training with cross-entropy (CE) loss can be ${\it misaligned}$ with pass@N in that pass@N accuracy ${\it decreases}$ with longer training. We explain the origins of this misalignment in terms of model overconfidence induced by CE, and experimentally verify our prediction of overconfidence as an impediment to scaling test-time compute via pass@N. Furthermore we suggest a principled, modified training loss that is better aligned to pass@N by limiting model confidence and rescuing pass@N test performance. Our algorithm demonstrates improved mathematical reasoning on MATH and MiniF2F benchmarks under several scenarios: (1) providing answers to math questions; and (2) proving theorems by searching over proof trees of varying shapes. Overall our work underscores the importance of co-designing two traditionally separate phases of LLM development: training-time protocols and test-time search and reasoning strategies.

  _Hongxu Chen, Runshi Li, Bowei Zhu, Zhen Wang, Long Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are widely used to fine-tune large models across various domains for specific downstream tasks. While task-specific LoRAs are often available, concerns about data privacy and intellectual property can restrict access to training data, limiting the acquisition of a multi-task model through gradient-based training. In response, LoRA merging presents an effective solution by combining multiple LoRAs into a unified adapter while maintaining data privacy. Prior works on LoRA merging primarily frame it as an optimization problem, yet these approaches face several limitations, including the rough assumption about input features utilized in optimization, massive sample requirements, and the unbalanced optimization objective. These limitations can significantly degrade performance. To address these, we propose a novel optimization-based method, named IterIS: 1) We formulate LoRA merging as an advanced optimization problem to mitigate the rough assumption. Additionally, we employ an iterative inference-solving framework in our algorithm. It can progressively refine the optimization objective for improved performance. 2) We introduce an efficient regularization term to reduce the need for massive sample requirements (requiring only 1-5% of the unlabeled samples compared to prior methods). 3) We utilize adaptive weights in the optimization objective to mitigate potential unbalances in LoRA merging process. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over multiple baselines and state-of-the-art methods in composing tasks for text-to-image diffusion, vision-language models, and large language models. Furthermore, our layer-wise algorithm can achieve convergence with minimal steps, ensuring efficiency in both memory and computation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Task arithmetic refers to editing the pre-trained model by adding a weighted sum of task vectors, each of which is the weight update from the pre-trained model to fine-tuned models for certain tasks. This approach recently gained attention as a computationally efficient inference method for model editing, e.g., multi-task learning, forgetting, and out-of-domain generalization capabilities. However, the theoretical understanding of why task vectors can execute various conceptual operations remains limited, due to the highly non-convexity of training Transformer-based models. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of the generalization guarantees of task vector methods on nonlinear Transformers. We consider a conceptual learning setting, where each task is a binary classification problem based on a discriminative pattern. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of task addition in simultaneously learning a set of irrelevant or aligned tasks, as well as the success of task negation in unlearning one task from irrelevant or contradictory tasks. Moreover, we prove the proper selection of linear coefficients for task arithmetic to achieve guaranteed generalization to out-of-domain tasks. All of our theoretical results hold for both dense-weight parameters and their low-rank approximations. Although established in a conceptual setting, our theoretical findings were validated on a practical machine unlearning task using the large language model Phi-1.5 (1.3B).

  _Rui Dai, Sile Hu, Xu Shen, Yonggang Zhang, Xinmei Tian, Jieping Ye_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Task arithmetic is a straightforward yet highly effective strategy for model merging, enabling the resultant model to exhibit multi-task capabilities. Recent research indicates that models demonstrating linearity enhance the performance of task arithmetic. In contrast to existing methods that rely on the global linearization of the model, we argue that this linearity already exists within the model's submodules. In particular, we present a statistical analysis and show that submodules (e.g., layers, self-attentions, and MLPs) exhibit significantly higher linearity than the overall model. Based on these findings, we propose an innovative model merging strategy that independently merges these submodules. Especially, we derive a closed-form solution for optimal merging weights grounded in the linear properties of these submodules. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the standard task arithmetic approach and other established baselines across different model scales and various tasks. This result highlights the benefits of leveraging the linearity of submodules and provides a new perspective for exploring solutions for effective and practical multi-task model merging.

  _Shuo Xie, Mohamad Amin Mohamadi, Zhiyuan Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adam outperforms SGD when training language models. Yet this advantage is not well-understood theoretically -- previous convergence analysis for Adam and SGD mainly focuses on the number of steps $T$ and is already minimax-optimal in non-convex cases, which are both $\widetilde{O}(T^{-1/4})$. In this work, we argue that the exploitation of nice $\ell_\infty$-geometry is the key advantage of Adam over SGD. More specifically, we give a new convergence analysis for Adam under novel assumptions that loss is smooth under $\ell_\infty$-geometry rather than the more common $\ell_2$-geometry, which yields a much better empirical smoothness constant for GPT-2 and ResNet models. Our experiments confirm that Adam performs much worse when the favorable $\ell_\infty$-geometry is changed while SGD provably remains unaffected. We also extend the convergence analysis to blockwise Adam under novel blockwise smoothness assumptions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) show promise for autonomous driving but often lack transparent reasoning capabilities that are critical for safety. We investigate whether explicitly modeling reasoning during fine-tuning enhances VLM performance on driving decision tasks. Using GPT-4o, we generate structured reasoning chains for driving scenarios from the DriveLM benchmark with category-specific prompting strategies. We compare reasoning-based fine-tuning, answer-only fine-tuning, and baseline instruction-tuned models across multiple small VLM families (Llama 3.2, Llava 1.5, and Qwen 2.5VL). Our results demonstrate that reasoning-based fine-tuning consistently outperforms alternatives, with Llama3.2-11B-reason achieving the highest performance. Models fine-tuned with reasoning show substantial improvements in accuracy and text generation quality, suggesting explicit reasoning enhances internal representations for driving decisions. These findings highlight the importance of transparent decision processes in safety-critical domains and offer a promising direction for developing more interpretable autonomous driving systems.

  Visual captioning benchmarks have become outdated with the emergence of modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as the brief ground-truth sentences and traditional metrics fail to assess detailed captions effectively. While recent benchmarks attempt to address this by focusing on keyword extraction or object-centric evaluation, they remain limited to vague-view or object-view analyses and incomplete visual element coverage. In this paper, we introduce CAPability, a comprehensive multi-view benchmark for evaluating visual captioning across 12 dimensions spanning six critical views. We curate nearly 11K human-annotated images and videos with visual element annotations to evaluate the generated captions. CAPability stably assesses both the correctness and thoroughness of captions using F1-score. By converting annotations to QA pairs, we further introduce a heuristic metric, \textit{know but cannot tell} ($K\bar{T}$), indicating a significant performance gap between QA and caption capabilities. Our work provides the first holistic analysis of MLLMs' captioning abilities, as we identify their strengths and weaknesses across various dimensions, guiding future research to enhance specific aspects of capabilities.

  In today's visually dominated social media landscape, predicting the perceived credibility of visual content and understanding what drives human judgment are crucial for countering misinformation. However, these tasks are challenging due to the diversity and richness of visual features. We introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-informed feature discovery framework that leverages multimodal LLMs, such as GPT-4o, to evaluate content credibility and explain its reasoning. We extract and quantify interpretable features using targeted prompts and integrate them into machine learning models to improve credibility predictions. We tested this approach on 4,191 visual social media posts across eight topics in science, health, and politics, using credibility ratings from 5,355 crowdsourced workers. Our method outperformed zero-shot GPT-based predictions by 13 percent in R2, and revealed key features like information concreteness and image format. We discuss the implications for misinformation mitigation, visual credibility, and the role of LLMs in social science.

  The rapid growth of intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) and integrated vehicle-road-cloud systems has increased the demand for accurate, real-time HD map updates. However, ensuring map reliability remains challenging due to inconsistencies in crowdsourced data, which suffer from motion blur, lighting variations, adverse weather, and lane marking degradation. This paper introduces CleanMAP, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based distillation framework designed to filter and refine crowdsourced data for high-confidence HD map updates. CleanMAP leverages an MLLM-driven lane visibility scoring model that systematically quantifies key visual parameters, assigning confidence scores (0-10) based on their impact on lane detection. A novel dynamic piecewise confidence-scoring function adapts scores based on lane visibility, ensuring strong alignment with human evaluations while effectively filtering unreliable data. To further optimize map accuracy, a confidence-driven local map fusion strategy ranks and selects the top-k highest-scoring local maps within an optimal confidence range (best score minus 10%), striking a balance between data quality and quantity. Experimental evaluations on a real-world autonomous vehicle dataset validate CleanMAP's effectiveness, demonstrating that fusing the top three local maps achieves the lowest mean map update error of 0.28m, outperforming the baseline (0.37m) and meeting stringent accuracy thresholds (<= 0.32m). Further validation with real-vehicle data confirms 84.88% alignment with human evaluators, reinforcing the model's robustness and reliability. This work establishes CleanMAP as a scalable and deployable solution for crowdsourced HD map updates, ensuring more precise and reliable autonomous navigation.

  Analyzing Fast, Frequent, and Fine-grained (F$^3$) events presents a significant challenge in video analytics and multi-modal LLMs. Current methods struggle to identify events that satisfy all the F$^3$ criteria with high accuracy due to challenges such as motion blur and subtle visual discrepancies. To advance research in video understanding, we introduce F$^3$Set, a benchmark that consists of video datasets for precise F$^3$ event detection. Datasets in F$^3$Set are characterized by their extensive scale and comprehensive detail, usually encompassing over 1,000 event types with precise timestamps and supporting multi-level granularity. Currently, F$^3$Set contains several sports datasets, and this framework may be extended to other applications as well. We evaluated popular temporal action understanding methods on F$^3$Set, revealing substantial challenges for existing techniques. Additionally, we propose a new method, F$^3$ED, for F$^3$ event detections, achieving superior performance. The dataset, model, and benchmark code are available atthis https URL.

  Increasing attention has been placed on improving the reasoning capacities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). As the cornerstone for AI agents that function in the physical realm, video-based visual-spatial intelligence (VSI) emerges as one of the most pivotal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. This work conducts a first, in-depth study on improving the visual-spatial reasoning of MLLMs via R1-Zero-like training. Technically, we first identify that the visual-spatial reasoning capacities of small- to medium-sized Qwen2-VL models cannot be activated via Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts. We then incorporate GRPO training for improved visual-spatial reasoning, using the carefully curated VSI-100k dataset, following DeepSeek-R1-Zero. During the investigation, we identify the necessity to keep the KL penalty (even with a small value) in GRPO. With just 120 GPU hours, our vsGRPO-2B model, fine-tuned from Qwen2-VL-2B, can outperform the base model by 12.1% and surpass GPT-4o. Moreover, our vsGRPO-7B model, fine-tuned from Qwen2-VL-7B, achieves performance comparable to that of the best open-source model LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B. Additionally, we compare vsGRPO to supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization baselines and observe strong performance superiority. The code and dataset will be available soon.

  _Zihao Pan, Weibin Wu, Yuhang Cao, Zibin Zheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep neural network based systems deployed in sensitive environments are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Unrestricted adversarial attacks typically manipulate the semantic content of an image (e.g., color or texture) to create adversarial examples that are both effective and photorealistic. Recent works have utilized the diffusion inversion process to map images into a latent space, where high-level semantics are manipulated by introducing perturbations. However, they often results in substantial semantic distortions in the denoised output and suffers from low efficiency. In this study, we propose a novel framework called Semantic-Consistent Unrestricted Adversarial Attacks (SCA), which employs an inversion method to extract edit-friendly noise maps and utilizes Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to provide semantic guidance throughout the process. Under the condition of rich semantic information provided by MLLM, we perform the DDPM denoising process of each step using a series of edit-friendly noise maps, and leverage DPM Solver++ to accelerate this process, enabling efficient sampling with semantic consistency. Compared to existing methods, our framework enables the efficient generation of adversarial examples that exhibit minimal discernible semantic changes. Consequently, we for the first time introduce Semantic-Consistent Adversarial Examples (SCAE). Extensive experiments and visualizations have demonstrated the high efficiency of SCA, particularly in being on average 12 times faster than the state-of-the-art attacks. Our research can further draw attention to the security of multimedia information.

  This work presents SimpleAR, a vanilla autoregressive visual generation framework without complex architecure modifications. Through careful exploration of training and inference optimization, we demonstrate that: 1) with only 0.5B parameters, our model can generate 1024x1024 resolution images with high fidelity, and achieve competitive results on challenging text-to-image benchmarks, e.g., 0.59 on GenEval and 79.66 on DPG; 2) both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training could lead to significant improvements on generation aesthectics and prompt alignment; and 3) when optimized with inference acceleraton techniques like vLLM, the time for SimpleAR to generate an 1024x1024 image could be reduced to around 14 seconds. By sharing these findings and open-sourcing the code, we hope to reveal the potential of autoregressive visual generation and encourage more participation in this research field.

  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in efficient image super-resolution. However, for CNN-based methods, performance gains often require deeper networks and larger feature maps, which increase complexity and inference costs. Inspired by LoRA's success in fine-tuning large language models, we explore its application to lightweight models and propose Distillation-Supervised Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (DSCLoRA), which improves model performance without increasing architectural complexity or inference costs. Specifically, we integrate ConvLoRA into the efficient SR network SPAN by replacing the SPAB module with the proposed SConvLB module and incorporating ConvLoRA layers into both the pixel shuffle block and its preceding convolutional layer. DSCLoRA leverages low-rank decomposition for parameter updates and employs a spatial feature affinity-based knowledge distillation strategy to transfer second-order statistical information from teacher models (pre-trained SPAN) to student models (ours). This method preserves the core knowledge of lightweight models and facilitates optimal solution discovery under certain conditions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that DSCLoRA improves PSNR and SSIM over SPAN while maintaining its efficiency and competitive image quality. Notably, DSCLoRA ranked first in the Overall Performance Track of the NTIRE 2025 Efficient Super-Resolution Challenge. Our code and models are made publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The exponential increase in video content poses significant challenges in terms of efficient navigation, search, and retrieval, thus requiring advanced video summarization techniques. Existing video summarization methods, which heavily rely on visual features and temporal dynamics, often fail to capture the semantics of video content, resulting in incomplete or incoherent summaries. To tackle the challenge, we propose a new video summarization framework that leverages the capabilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs), expecting that the knowledge learned from massive data enables LLMs to evaluate video frames in a manner that better aligns with diverse semantics and human judgments, effectively addressing the inherent subjectivity in defining keyframes. Our method, dubbed LLM-based Video Summarization (LLMVS), translates video frames into a sequence of captions using a Muti-modal Large Language Model (M-LLM) and then assesses the importance of each frame using an LLM, based on the captions in its local context. These local importance scores are refined through a global attention mechanism in the entire context of video captions, ensuring that our summaries effectively reflect both the details and the overarching narrative. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing ones in standard benchmarks, highlighting the potential of LLMs in the processing of multimedia content.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Historical maps are essential resources that provide insights into the geographical landscapes of the past. They serve as valuable tools for researchers across disciplines such as history, geography, and urban studies, facilitating the reconstruction of historical environments and the analysis of spatial transformations over time. However, when constrained to analogue or scanned formats, their interpretation is limited to humans and therefore not scalable. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly in computer vision and large language models (LLMs), have opened new avenues for automating the recognition and classification of features and objects in historical maps. In this paper, we propose a novel distillation method that leverages LLMs and attention mechanisms for the automatic annotation of historical maps. LLMs are employed to generate coarse classification labels for low-resolution historical image patches, while attention mechanisms are utilized to refine these labels to higher resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that the refined labels achieve a high recall of more than 90%. Additionally, the intersection over union (IoU) scores--84.2% for Wood and 72.0% for Settlement--along with precision scores of 87.1% and 79.5%, respectively, indicate that most labels are well-aligned with ground-truth annotations. Notably, these results were achieved without the use of fine-grained manual labels during training, underscoring the potential of our approach for efficient and scalable historical map analysis.

  Language-based foundation models, such as large language models (LLMs) or large vision-language models (LVLMs), have been widely studied in long-tailed recognition. However, the need for linguistic data is not applicable to all practical tasks. In this study, we aim to explore using large vision models (LVMs) or visual foundation models (VFMs) to enhance long-tailed data features without any language information. Specifically, we extract features from the LVM and fuse them with features in the baseline network's map and latent space to obtain the augmented features. Moreover, we design several prototype-based losses in the latent space to further exploit the potential of the augmented features. In the experimental section, we validate our approach on two benchmark datasets: ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist2018.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conditional layout generation aims to automatically generate visually appealing and semantically coherent layouts from user-defined constraints. While recent methods based on generative models have shown promising results, they typically require substantial amounts of training data or extensive fine-tuning, limiting their versatility and practical applicability. Alternatively, some training-free approaches leveraging in-context learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged, but they often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities and overly simplistic ranking mechanisms, which restrict their ability to generate consistently high-quality layouts. To this end, we propose LayoutCoT, a novel approach that leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through a combination of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. Specifically, LayoutCoT transforms layout representations into a standardized serialized format suitable for processing by LLMs. A Layout-aware RAG is used to facilitate effective retrieval and generate a coarse layout by LLMs. This preliminary layout, together with the selected exemplars, is then fed into a specially designed CoT reasoning module for iterative refinement, significantly enhancing both semantic coherence and visual quality. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets spanning three conditional layout generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LayoutCoT achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring training or fine-tuning. Notably, our CoT reasoning module enables standard LLMs, even those without explicit deep reasoning abilities, to outperform specialized deep-reasoning models such as deepseek-R1, highlighting the potential of our approach in unleashing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs for layout generation tasks.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have altered the landscape of computer vision, obtaining impressive results across a wide range of tasks, especially in zero-shot settings. Unfortunately, their strong performance does not always transfer to out-of-distribution domains, such as earth observation (EO) imagery. Prior work has demonstrated that MLLMs excel at some EO tasks, such as image captioning and scene understanding, while failing at tasks that require more fine-grained spatial reasoning, such as object localization. However, MLLMs are advancing rapidly and insights quickly become out-dated. In this work, we analyze more recent MLLMs that have been explicitly trained to include fine-grained spatial reasoning capabilities, benchmarking them on EO object localization tasks. We demonstrate that these models are performant in certain settings, making them well suited for zero-shot scenarios. Additionally, we provide a detailed discussion focused on prompt selection, ground sample distance (GSD) optimization, and analyzing failure cases. We hope that this work will prove valuable as others evaluate whether an MLLM is well suited for a given EO localization task and how to optimize it.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for visual document understanding (VDU), visual information extraction (VIE) from relation-rich documents remains challenging due to the layout diversity and limited training data. While existing synthetic document generators attempt to address data scarcity, they either rely on manually designed layouts and templates, or adopt rule-based approaches that limit layout diversity. Besides, current layout generation methods focus solely on topological patterns without considering textual content, making them impractical for generating documents with complex associations between the contents and layouts. In this paper, we propose a Relation-rIch visual Document GEnerator (RIDGE) that addresses these limitations through a two-stage approach: (1) Content Generation, which leverages LLMs to generate document content using a carefully designed Hierarchical Structure Text format which captures entity categories and relationships, and (2) Content-driven Layout Generation, which learns to create diverse, plausible document layouts solely from easily available Optical Character Recognition (OCR) results, requiring no human labeling or annotations efforts. Experimental results have demonstrated that our method significantly enhances the performance of document understanding models on various VIE benchmarks. The code and model will be available atthis https URL.

  We curate a dataset AgMMU for evaluating and developing vision-language models (VLMs) to produce factually accurate answers for knowledge-intensive expert domains. Our AgMMU concentrates on one of the most socially beneficial domains, agriculture, which requires connecting detailed visual observation with precise knowledge to diagnose, e.g., pest identification, management instructions, etc. As a core uniqueness of our dataset, all facts, questions, and answers are extracted from 116,231 conversations between real-world users and authorized agricultural experts. After a three-step dataset curation pipeline with GPT-4o, LLaMA models, and human verification, AgMMU features an evaluation set of 5,460 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and open-ended questions (OEQs). We also provide a development set that contains 205,399 pieces of agricultural knowledge information, including disease identification, symptoms descriptions, management instructions, insect and pest identification, and species identification. As a multimodal factual dataset, it reveals that existing VLMs face significant challenges with questions requiring both detailed perception and factual knowledge. Moreover, open-source VLMs still demonstrate a substantial performance gap compared to proprietary ones. To advance knowledge-intensive VLMs, we conduct fine-tuning experiments using our development set, which improves LLaVA-1.5 evaluation accuracy by up to 3.1%. We hope that AgMMU can serve both as an evaluation benchmark dedicated to agriculture and a development suite for incorporating knowledge-intensive expertise into general-purpose VLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce InternVL3, a significant advancement in the InternVL series featuring a native multimodal pre-training paradigm. Rather than adapting a text-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and linguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora during a single pre-training stage. This unified training paradigm effectively addresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in conventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve performance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position encoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed preference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies alongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of multi-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the MMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its capabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models, including ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also maintaining strong pure-language proficiency. In pursuit of open-science principles, we will publicly release both the training data and model weights to foster further research and development in next-generation MLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable versatility in understanding diverse multimodal data and tasks. However, these capabilities come with an increased model scale. While post-training pruning reduces model size in unimodal models, its application to MLLMs often yields limited success. Our analysis discovers that conventional methods fail to account for the unique token attributes across layers and modalities inherent to MLLMs. Inspired by this observation, we propose TAMP, a simple yet effective pruning framework tailored for MLLMs, featuring two key components: (1) Diversity-Aware Sparsity, which adjusts sparsity ratio per layer based on diversities among multimodal output tokens, preserving more parameters in high-diversity layers; and (2) Adaptive Multimodal Input Activation, which identifies representative multimodal input tokens using attention scores to guide unstructured weight pruning. We validate our method on two state-of-the-art MLLMs: LLaVA-NeXT, designed for vision-language tasks, and VideoLLaMA2, capable of processing audio, visual, and language modalities. Empirical experiments across various multimodal evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that each component of our approach substantially outperforms existing pruning techniques.

  We present Kimi-VL, an efficient open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model (VLM) that offers advanced multimodal reasoning, long-context understanding, and strong agent capabilities - all while activating only 2.8B parameters in its language decoder (Kimi-VL-A3B). Kimi-VL demonstrates strong performance across challenging domains: as a general-purpose VLM, Kimi-VL excels in multi-turn agent tasks (e.g., OSWorld), matching flagship models. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable capabilities across diverse challenging vision language tasks, including college-level image and video comprehension, OCR, mathematical reasoning, and multi-image understanding. In comparative evaluations, it effectively competes with cutting-edge efficient VLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, and Gemma-3-12B-IT, while surpassing GPT-4o in several key domains. Kimi-VL also advances in processing long contexts and perceiving clearly. With a 128K extended context window, Kimi-VL can process diverse long inputs, achieving impressive scores of 64.5 on LongVideoBench and 35.1 on MMLongBench-Doc. Its native-resolution vision encoder, MoonViT, further allows it to see and understand ultra-high-resolution visual inputs, achieving 83.2 on InfoVQA and 34.5 on ScreenSpot-Pro, while maintaining lower computational cost for common tasks. Building upon Kimi-VL, we introduce an advanced long-thinking variant: Kimi-VL-Thinking. Developed through long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), this model exhibits strong long-horizon reasoning capabilities. It achieves scores of 61.7 on MMMU, 36.8 on MathVision, and 71.3 on MathVista while maintaining the compact 2.8B activated LLM parameters, setting a new standard for efficient multimodal thinking models.

  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) helps reduce hallucinations in Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VLLMs), but its reliance on offline preference data limits adaptability and fails to capture true video-response misalignment. We propose Video Direct Preference Optimization (VDPO), an online preference learning framework that eliminates the need for preference annotation by leveraging video augmentations to generate rejected samples while keeping responses fixed. However, selecting effective augmentations is non-trivial, as some clips may be semantically identical to the original under specific prompts, leading to false rejections and disrupting alignment. To address this, we introduce Prompt-aware Multi-instance Learning VDPO (PaMi-VDPO), which selects augmentations based on prompt context. Instead of a single rejection, we construct a candidate set of augmented clips and apply a close-to-far selection strategy, initially ensuring all clips are semantically relevant while then prioritizing the most prompt-aware distinct clip. This allows the model to better capture meaningful visual differences, mitigating hallucinations, while avoiding false rejections, and improving alignment. PaMi-VDPOseamlessly integrates into existing VLLMs without additional parameters, GPT-4/human supervision. With only 10k SFT data, it improves the base model by 5.3% on VideoHallucer, surpassing GPT-4o, while maintaining stable performance on general video benchmarks.

  This paper investigates the thinking process in rule-based reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RFT) for multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). We first propose CLS-RL for classification, using verifiable rewards to encourage MLLM thinking. Experiments show CLS-RL significantly outperforms SFT and yields a 'free-lunch' generalization effect (improving performance on unseen datasets after training on one dataset). We then question if this explicit thinking is always necessary for RFT. Challenging convention that explicit thinking is crucial for RFT, we introduce No-Thinking-RL, minimizing thinking via a simple equality accuracy reward. Experiments show No-Thinking-RL surpasses CLS-RL in in-domain and generalization abilities, with significantly less fine-tuning time. This suggests reducing thinking can improve MLLM fine-tuning efficiency and effectiveness for certain visual tasks. We hypothesize explicit thinking negatively impacts reward convergence during RFT. To test this, we propose the Think-After-Answerwer method to let models first output the answer and then generate thinking process to alliviate the negative impact of thinking. We further test No-Thinking-RL on diverse tasks (including math, spatial, puzzles) with 2B and 7B models. For 2B models, No-Thinking-RL outperforms thinking-based RFT for all tasks, even on math, with Think-After-Answerwer performing intermediately. For 7B models, performance is comparable on simple visual tasks, but RFT with thinking excels on complex reasoning (math). This implies when dealing with complex math problems, smaller models struggle with generating effective reasoning, hurting performance on complex tasks. Conversely, for simple visual tasks, thinking is not indispensable, and its removal can boost performance and reduce training time. We hope our findings offer insights for better understanding the effect of the thinking process in RFT.

  Foundation models trained on vast amounts of data have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generation capabilities in the domains of text, images, audio and video. Our goal at Roblox is to build such a foundation model for 3D intelligence, a model that can support developers in producing all aspects of a Roblox experience, from generating 3D objects and scenes to rigging characters for animation to producing programmatic scripts describing object behaviors. We discuss three key design requirements for such a 3D foundation model and then present our first step towards building such a model. We expect that 3D geometric shapes will be a core data type and describe our solution for 3D shape tokenizer. We show how our tokenization scheme can be used in applications for text-to-shape generation, shape-to-text generation and text-to-scene generation. We demonstrate how these applications can collaborate with existing large language models (LLMs) to perform scene analysis and reasoning. We conclude with a discussion outlining our path to building a fully unified foundation model for 3D intelligence.

  Deploying large language models (LLMs) presents critical challenges due to the inherent trade-offs associated with key performance metrics, such as latency, accuracy, and throughput. Typically, gains in one metric is accompanied with degradation in others. Early-Exit LLMs (EE-LLMs) efficiently navigate this trade-off space by skipping some of the later model layers when it confidently finds an output token early, thus reducing latency without impacting accuracy. However, as the early exits taken depend on the task and are unknown apriori to request processing, EE-LLMs conservatively load the entire model, limiting resource savings and throughput. Also, current frameworks statically select a model for a user task, limiting our ability to adapt to changing nature of the input queries.We propose HELIOS to address these challenges. First, HELIOS shortlists a set of candidate LLMs, evaluates them using a subset of prompts, gathering telemetry data in real-time. Second, HELIOS uses the early exit data from these evaluations to greedily load the selected model only up to a limited number of layers. This approach yields memory savings which enables us to process more requests at the same time, thereby improving throughput. Third, HELIOS monitors and periodically reassesses the performance of the candidate LLMs and if needed, switches to another model that can service incoming queries more efficiently (such as using fewer layers without lowering accuracy). Our evaluations show that HELIOS achieves 1.48$\times$ throughput, 1.10$\times$ energy-efficiency, 1.39$\times$ lower response time, and 3.7$\times$ improvements in inference batch sizes compared to the baseline, when optimizing for the respective service level objectives.

  Large language models have evolved to process multiple modalities beyond text, such as images and audio, which motivates us to explore how to effectively leverage them for graph reasoning tasks. The key question, therefore, is how to transform graphs into linear sequences of tokens, a process we term "graph linearization", so that LLMs can handle graphs naturally. We consider that graphs should be linearized meaningfully to reflect certain properties of natural language text, such as local dependency and global alignment, in order to ease contemporary LLMs, trained on trillions of textual tokens, better understand graphs. To achieve this, we developed several graph linearization methods based on graph centrality and degeneracy. These methods are further enhanced using node relabeling techniques. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods compared to the random linearization baseline. Our work introduces novel graph representations suitable for LLMs, contributing to the potential integration of graph machine learning with the trend of multimodal processing using a unified transformer model.

  Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution to compress large language models (LLMs) by transferring their knowledge to smaller models. During this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between the output distributions of the teacher model and the student model to transfer more information. However, we reveal that the current white-box KD framework exhibits two limitations: a) bridging probability distributions from different output spaces will limit the similarity between the teacher model and the student model; b) this framework cannot be applied to LLMs with different vocabularies. One of the root causes for these limitations is that the distributions from the teacher and the student for KD are output by different prediction heads, which yield distributions in different output spaces and dimensions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual-space knowledge distillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the prediction heads of the teacher and the student models for KD. Specifically, we first introduce two projectors with ideal initialization to project the teacher/student hidden states into the student/teacher representation spaces. After this, the hidden states from different models can share the same head and unify the output spaces of the distributions. Furthermore, we develop an exact token alignment (ETA) algorithm to align the same tokens in two differently-tokenized sequences. Based on the above, our DSKD framework is a general KD framework that supports both off-policy and on-policy KD, and KD between any two LLMs regardless of their vocabularies. Extensive experiments on instruction-following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation benchmarks show that DSKD significantly outperforms existing methods based on the current white-box KD framework and surpasses other cross-tokenizer KD methods for LLMs with different vocabularies.

  Brand reputation in the banking sector is maintained through insightful analysis of customer opinion on code-mixed and multilingual content. Conventional NLP models misclassify or ignore code-mixed text, when mix with low resource languages such as Sinhala-English and fail to capture domain-specific knowledge. This study introduces a hybrid NLP method to improve keyword extraction, content filtering, and aspect-based classification of banking content. Keyword extraction in English is performed with a hybrid approach comprising a fine-tuned SpaCy NER model, FinBERT-based KeyBERT embeddings, YAKE, and EmbedRank, which results in a combined accuracy of 91.2%. Code-mixed and Sinhala keywords are extracted using a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa model integrated with a domain-specific Sinhala financial vocabulary, and it results in an accuracy of 87.4%. To ensure data quality, irrelevant comment filtering was performed using several models, with the BERT-base-uncased model achieving 85.2% for English and XLM-RoBERTa 88.1% for Sinhala, which was better than GPT-4o, SVM, and keyword-based filtering. Aspect classification followed the same pattern, with the BERT-base-uncased model achieving 87.4% for English and XLM-RoBERTa 85.9% for Sinhala, both exceeding GPT-4 and keyword-based approaches. These findings confirm that fine-tuned transformer models outperform traditional methods in multilingual financial text analysis. The present framework offers an accurate and scalable solution for brand reputation monitoring in code-mixed and low-resource banking environments.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities when prompted with strategies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, these approaches focus on token-level output without considering internal weight dynamics. We introduce Weight-of-Thought (WoT) reasoning, a novel approach that examines neural network weights before inference to identify reasoning pathways. Unlike existing methods, WoT explores the weight space through graph-based message passing, multi-step reasoning processes, and attention mechanisms. Our implementation creates an interconnected graph of reasoning nodes. Experiments on diverse reasoning tasks (syllogistic, mathematical, algebraic, combinatorial, and geometric) demonstrate that WoT achieves superior performance compared to traditional methods, particularly for complex problems. This approach leads to both improved performance and greater interpretability of the reasoning process, offering a promising direction for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

  Recent studies have demonstrated that large pretrained language models (LLMs) such as BERT and GPT-2 exhibit biases in token prediction, often inherited from the data distributions present in their training corpora. In response, a number of mathematical frameworks have been proposed to quantify, identify, and mitigate these the likelihood of biased token predictions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of such techniques tailored towards widely used LLMs such as BERT, GPT-2, etc. We additionally introduce Fairpy, a modular and extensible toolkit that provides plug-and-play interfaces for integrating these mathematical tools, enabling users to evaluate both pretrained and custom language models.

  The capacity for complex mathematical reasoning is a key benchmark for artificial intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) applied to LLMs shows promise, progress is significantly hindered by the lack of large-scale training data that is sufficiently challenging, possesses verifiable answer formats suitable for RL, and is free from contamination with evaluation benchmarks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepMath-103K, a new, large-scale dataset comprising approximately 103K mathematical problems, specifically designed to train advanced reasoning models via RL. DeepMath-103K is curated through a rigorous pipeline involving source analysis, stringent decontamination against numerous benchmarks, and filtering for high difficulty (primarily Levels 5-9), significantly exceeding existing open resources in challenge. Each problem includes a verifiable final answer, enabling rule-based RL, and three distinct R1-generated solutions suitable for diverse training paradigms like supervised fine-tuning or distillation. Spanning a wide range of mathematical topics, DeepMath-103K promotes the development of generalizable reasoning. We demonstrate that models trained on DeepMath-103K achieve significant improvements on challenging mathematical benchmarks, validating its effectiveness. We release DeepMath-103K publicly to facilitate community progress in building more capable AI reasoning systems:this https URL.

  Recent advances in reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) mark a shift from general LLMs toward models designed for complex decision-making, a crucial aspect in medicine. However, their performance in specialized domains like ophthalmology remains underexplored. This study comprehensively evaluated and compared the accuracy and reasoning capabilities of four newly developed reasoning-focused LLMs, namely DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1, o3-mini, and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking. Each model was assessed using 5,888 multiple-choice ophthalmology exam questions from the MedMCQA dataset in zero-shot setting. Quantitative evaluation included accuracy, Macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, METEOR, BERTScore, BARTScore, and AlignScore), computed against ground-truth reasonings. Average inference time was recorded for a subset of 100 randomly selected questions. Additionally, two board-certified ophthalmologists qualitatively assessed clarity, completeness, and reasoning structure of responses to differential diagnosis questions.O1 (0.902) and DeepSeek-R1 (0.888) achieved the highest accuracy, with o1 also leading in Macro-F1 (0.900). The performance of models across the text-generation metrics varied: O3-mini excelled in ROUGE-L (0.151), o1 in METEOR (0.232), DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini tied for BERTScore (0.673), DeepSeek-R1 (-4.105) and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking (-4.127) performed best in BARTScore, while o3-mini (0.181) and o1 (0.176) led AlignScore. Inference time across the models varied, with DeepSeek-R1 being slowest (40.4 seconds) and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking fastest (6.7 seconds). Qualitative evaluation revealed that DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking tended to provide detailed and comprehensive intermediate reasoning, whereas o1 and o3-mini displayed concise and summarized justifications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sexism is generally defined as prejudice and discrimination based on sex or gender, affecting every sector of society, from social institutions to relationships and individual behavior. Social media platforms amplify the impact of sexism by conveying discriminatory content not only through text but also across multiple modalities, highlighting the critical need for a multimodal approach to the analysis of sexism online. With the rise of social media platforms where users share short videos, sexism is increasingly spreading through video content. Automatically detecting sexism in videos is a challenging task, as it requires analyzing the combination of verbal, audio, and visual elements to identify sexist content. In this study, (1) we introduce MuSeD, a new Multimodal Spanish dataset for Sexism Detection consisting of $\approx$ 11 hours of videos extracted from TikTok and BitChute; (2) we propose an innovative annotation framework for analyzing the contribution of textual and multimodal labels in the classification of sexist and non-sexist content; and (3) we evaluate a range of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs on the task of sexism detection. We find that visual information plays a key role in labeling sexist content for both humans and models. Models effectively detect explicit sexism; however, they struggle with implicit cases, such as stereotypes, instances where annotators also show low agreement. This highlights the inherent difficulty of the task, as identifying implicit sexism depends on the social and cultural context.

  While multimodal fusion has been extensively studied in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), the role of fusion depth and multimodal capacity allocation remains underexplored. In this work, we position fusion depth, scalability, and dedicated multimodal capacity as primary factors for effective fusion. We introduce DeepMLF, a novel multimodal language model (LM) with learnable tokens tailored toward deep fusion. DeepMLF leverages an audiovisual encoder and a pretrained decoder LM augmented with multimodal information across its layers. We append learnable tokens to the LM that: 1) capture modality interactions in a controlled fashion and 2) preserve independent information flow for each modality. These fusion tokens gather linguistic information via causal self-attention in LM Blocks and integrate with audiovisual information through cross-attention MM Blocks. Serving as dedicated multimodal capacity, this design enables progressive fusion across multiple layers, providing depth in the fusion process. Our training recipe combines modality-specific losses and language modelling loss, with the decoder LM tasked to predict ground truth polarity. Across three MSA benchmarks with varying dataset characteristics, DeepMLF achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results confirm that deeper fusion leads to better performance, with optimal fusion depths (5-7) exceeding those of existing approaches. Additionally, our analysis on the number of fusion tokens reveals that small token sets ($\sim$20) achieve optimal performance. We examine the importance of representation learning order (fusion curriculum) through audiovisual encoder initialization experiments. Our ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed fusion design and gating while providing a holistic examination of DeepMLF's scalability to LLMs, and the impact of each training objective and embedding regularization.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance across a variety of tasks, partly due to advanced prompting techniques. However, these techniques often require lengthy prompts, which increase computational costs and can hinder performance because of the limited context windows of LLMs. While prompt compression is a straightforward solution, existing methods confront the challenges of retaining essential information, adapting to context changes, and remaining effective across different tasks. To tackle these issues, we propose a task-agnostic method called Dynamic Compressing Prompts (LLM-DCP). Our method reduces the number of prompt tokens while aiming to preserve the performance as much as possible. We model prompt compression as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling the DCP-Agent to sequentially remove redundant tokens by adapting to dynamic contexts and retaining crucial content. We develop a reward function for training the DCP-Agent that balances the compression rate, the quality of the LLM output, and the retention of key information. This allows for prompt token reduction without needing an external black-box LLM. Inspired by the progressive difficulty adjustment in curriculum learning, we introduce a Hierarchical Prompt Compression (HPC) training strategy that gradually increases the compression difficulty, enabling the DCP-Agent to learn an effective compression method that maintains information integrity. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, especially at higher compression rates. The code for our approach will be available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) perform well in medical QA, but their effectiveness in Japanese contexts is limited due to privacy constraints that prevent the use of commercial models like GPT-4 in clinical settings. As a result, recent efforts focus on instruction-tuning open-source LLMs, though the potential of combining them with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to explore a knowledge graph-based (KG) RAG framework for Japanese medical QA small-scale open-source LLMs. Experimental results show that KG-based RAG has only a limited impact on Japanese medical QA using small-scale open-source LLMs. Further case studies reveal that the effectiveness of the RAG is sensitive to the quality and relevance of the external retrieved content. These findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential of applying RAG in Japanese medical QA, while also serving as a reference for other low-resource languages.

  _Phill Kyu Rhee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs), powered by Transformers, have demonstrated human-like intelligence capabilities, yet their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This paper presents a novel framework for interpreting LLMs as probabilistic left context-sensitive languages (CSLs) generators. We hypothesize that Transformers can be effectively decomposed into three fundamental components: context windows, attention mechanisms, and autoregressive generation frameworks. This decomposition allows for the development of more flexible and interpretable computational models, moving beyond the traditional view of attention and autoregression as inseparable processes. We argue that next-token predictions can be understood as probabilistic, dynamic approximations of left CSL production rules, providing an intuitive explanation for how simple token predictions can yield human-like intelligence outputs. Given that all CSLs are left context-sensitive (Penttonen, 1974), we conclude that Transformers stochastically approximate CSLs, which are widely recognized as models of human-like intelligence. This interpretation bridges the gap between Formal Language Theory and the observed generative power of Transformers, laying a foundation for future advancements in generative AI theory and applications. Our novel perspective on Transformer architectures will foster a deeper understanding of LLMs and their future potentials.

  Navigating high-stakes dilemmas involving conflicting values is challenging even for humans, let alone for AI. Yet prior work in evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in such situations has been limited to everyday scenarios. To close this gap, this work first introduces CLASH (Character perspective-based LLM Assessments in Situations with High-stakes), a meticulously curated dataset consisting of 345 high-impact dilemmas along with 3,795 individual perspectives of diverse values. In particular, we design CLASH in a way to support the study of critical aspects of value-based decision-making processes which are missing from prior work, including understanding decision ambivalence and psychological discomfort as well as capturing the temporal shifts of values in characters' perspectives. By benchmarking 10 open and closed frontier models, we uncover several key findings. (1) Even the strongest models, such as GPT-4o and Claude-Sonnet, achieve less than 50% accuracy in identifying situations where the decision should be ambivalent, while they perform significantly better in clear-cut scenarios. (2) While LLMs reasonably predict psychological discomfort as marked by human, they inadequately comprehend perspectives involving value shifts, indicating a need for LLMs to reason over complex values. (3) Our experiments also reveal a significant correlation between LLMs' value preferences and their steerability towards a given value. (4) Finally, LLMs exhibit greater steerability when engaged in value reasoning from a third-party perspective, compared to a first-person setup, though certain value pairs benefit uniquely from the first-person framing.

  Multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmarks are widely used for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their reliability is undermined by benchmark contamination. In this study, we reframe contamination as an inherent aspect of learning and seek to disentangle genuine capability acquisition from superficial memorization in LLM evaluation. First, by analyzing model performance under different memorization conditions, we uncover a counterintuitive trend: LLMs perform worse on memorized MCQs than on non-memorized ones, indicating the coexistence of two distinct learning phenomena, i.e., rote memorization and genuine capability learning. To disentangle them, we propose TrinEval, a novel evaluation framework that reformulates MCQs into an alternative trinity format, reducing memorization while preserving knowledge assessment. Experiments validate TrinEval's effectiveness in reformulation, and its evaluation reveals that common LLMs may memorize by rote 20.5% of knowledge points (in MMLU on average).

  Misleading chart visualizations, which intentionally manipulate data representations to support specific claims, can distort perceptions and lead to incorrect conclusions. Despite decades of research, misleading visualizations remain a widespread and pressing issue. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong chart comprehension capabilities, yet no existing work has systematically evaluated their ability to detect and interpret misleading charts. This paper introduces the Misleading Chart Question Answering (Misleading ChartQA) Benchmark, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed to assess MLLMs in identifying and reasoning about misleading charts. It contains over 3,000 curated examples, covering 21 types of misleaders and 10 chart types. Each example includes standardized chart code, CSV data, and multiple-choice questions with labeled explanations, validated through multi-round MLLM checks and exhausted expert human review. We benchmark 16 state-of-the-art MLLMs on our dataset, revealing their limitations in identifying visually deceptive practices. We also propose a novel pipeline that detects and localizes misleaders, enhancing MLLMs' accuracy in misleading chart interpretation. Our work establishes a foundation for advancing MLLM-driven misleading chart comprehension. We publicly release the sample dataset to support further research in this critical area.

  Personality assessment, particularly through situational judgment tests (SJTs), is a vital tool for psychological research, talent selection, and educational evaluation. This study explores the potential of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM), to automate the generation of personality situational judgment tests (PSJTs) in Chinese. Traditional SJT development is labor-intensive and prone to biases, while GPT-4 offers a scalable, efficient alternative. Two studies were conducted: Study 1 evaluated the impact of prompt design and temperature settings on content validity, finding that optimized prompts with a temperature of 1.0 produced creative and accurate items. Study 2 assessed the psychometric properties of GPT-4-generated PSJTs, revealing that they demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity, surpassing the performance of manually developed tests in measuring the Big Five personality traits. This research highlights GPT-4's effectiveness in developing high-quality PSJTs, providing a scalable and innovative method for psychometric test development. These findings expand the possibilities of automatic item generation and the application of LLMs in psychology, and offer practical implications for streamlining test development processes in resource-limited settings.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked the potential for generating high-quality game commentary. However, producing insightful and engaging commentary for complex games with incomplete information remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel commentary method that combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) and LLMs, tailored specifically for the Chinese card game \textit{Guandan}. Our system leverages RL to generate intricate card-playing scenarios and employs LLMs to generate corresponding commentary text, effectively emulating the strategic analysis and narrative prowess of professional commentators. The framework comprises a state commentary guide, a Theory of Mind (ToM)-based strategy analyzer, and a style retrieval module, which seamlessly collaborate to deliver detailed and context-relevant game commentary in the Chinese language environment. We empower LLMs with ToM capabilities and refine both retrieval and information filtering mechanisms. This facilitates the generation of personalized commentary content. Our experimental results showcase the substantial enhancement in performance achieved by the proposed commentary framework when applied to open-source LLMs, surpassing the performance of GPT-4 across multiple evaluation metrics.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous tasks, yet they often rely on external context to handle complex tasks. While retrieval-augmented frameworks traditionally focus on selecting top-ranked documents in a single pass, many real-world scenarios demand compositional retrieval, where multiple sources must be combined in a coordinated manner. In this work, we propose a tri-encoder sequential retriever that models this process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), decomposing the probability of retrieving a set of elements into a sequence of conditional probabilities and allowing each retrieval step to be conditioned on previously selected examples. We train the retriever in two stages: first, we efficiently construct supervised sequential data for initial policy training; we then refine the policy to align with the LLM's preferences using a reward grounded in the structural correspondence of generated programs. Experimental results show that our method consistently and significantly outperforms baselines, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling inter-example dependencies. These findings highlight the potential of compositional retrieval for tasks requiring multiple pieces of evidence or examples.

  Hybrid LLM architectures that combine Attention and State Space Models (SSMs) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and runtime performance. Recent work has demonstrated that applying compression and distillation to Attention-only models yields smaller, more accurate models at a fraction of the training cost. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of compressing Hybrid architectures. We introduce a novel group-aware pruning strategy that preserves the structural integrity of SSM blocks and their sequence modeling capabilities. Furthermore, we demonstrate the necessity of such SSM pruning to achieve improved accuracy and inference speed compared to traditional approaches. Our compression recipe combines SSM, FFN, embedding dimension, and layer pruning, followed by knowledge distillation-based retraining, similar to the MINITRON technique. Using this approach, we compress the Nemotron-H 8B Hybrid model down to 4B parameters with up to 40x fewer training tokens. The resulting model surpasses the accuracy of similarly-sized models while achieving 2x faster inference, significantly advancing the Pareto frontier.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although large language models (LLMs) have become generally more capable and accurate across many tasks, some fundamental sources of unreliability remain in their behavior. One key limitation is their inconsistency at reporting the the same information when prompts are changed. In this paper, we consider the discrepancy between a model's generated answer and their own verification of that answer, the generator-validator gap. We define this gap in a more stringent way than prior work: we expect correlation of scores from a generator and a validator over the entire set of candidate answers. We show that according to this measure, a large gap exists in various settings, including question answering, lexical semantics tasks, and next-word prediction. We then propose RankAlign, a ranking-based training method, and show that it significantly closes the gap by 31.8% on average, surpassing all baseline methods. Moreover, this approach generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks and lexical items.

  Python is one of the most commonly used programming languages in industry and education. Its English keywords and built-in functions/modules allow it to come close to pseudo-code in terms of its readability and ease of writing. However, those who do not speak English may not experience these advantages. In fact, they may even be hindered in their ability to understand Python code, as the English nature of its terms creates an additional layer of overhead. To that end, we introduce the task of automatically translating Python's natural modality (keywords, error types, identifiers, etc.) into other human languages. This presents a unique challenge, considering the abbreviated nature of these forms, as well as potential untranslatability of advanced mathematical/programming concepts across languages. We therefore create an automated pipeline to translate Python into other human languages, comparing strategies using machine translation and large language models. We then use this pipeline to acquire translations from five common Python libraries (pytorch, pandas, tensorflow, numpy, and random) in seven languages, and do a quality test on a subset of these terms in French, Greek, and Bengali. We hope this will provide a clearer path forward towards creating a universal Python, accessible to anyone regardless of nationality or language background.

  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit excellent performance in natural language processing (NLP), but remain highly sensitive to the quality of input queries, especially when these queries contain misleading or inaccurate information. Existing methods focus on correcting the output, but they often overlook the potential of improving the ability of LLMs to detect and correct misleading content in the input itself. In this paper, we propose a novel three-stage fine-tuning method that enhances the ability of LLMs to detect and correct misleading information in the input, further improving response accuracy and reducing hallucinations. Specifically, the three stages include (1) training LLMs to identify misleading information, (2) training LLMs to correct the misleading information using built-in or external knowledge, and (3) training LLMs to generate accurate answers based on the corrected queries. To evaluate our method, we conducted experiments on three datasets for the hallucination detection task and the question answering (QA) task, as well as two datasets containing misleading information that we constructed. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy and factuality of LLM responses, while also enhancing the ability to detect hallucinations and reducing the generation of hallucinations in the output, particularly when the query contains misleading information. We will publicly release our code upon acceptance.

  Similar to LLMs, the development of vision language models is mainly driven by English datasets and models trained in English and Chinese language, whereas support for other languages, even those considered high-resource languages such as German, remains significantly weaker. In this work we present an analysis of open-weight VLMs on factual knowledge in the German and English language. We disentangle the image-related aspects from the textual ones by analyzing accu-racy with jury-as-a-judge in both prompt languages and images from German and international contexts. We found that for celebrities and sights, VLMs struggle because they are lacking visual cognition of German image contents. For animals and plants, the tested models can often correctly identify the image contents ac-cording to the scientific name or English common name but fail in German lan-guage. Cars and supermarket products were identified equally well in English and German images across both prompt languages.

  Peer review is a cornerstone of quality control in scientific publishing. With the increasing workload, the unintended use of `quick' heuristics, referred to as lazy thinking, has emerged as a recurring issue compromising review quality. Automated methods to detect such heuristics can help improve the peer-reviewing process. However, there is limited NLP research on this issue, and no real-world dataset exists to support the development of detection tools. This work introduces LazyReview, a dataset of peer-review sentences annotated with fine-grained lazy thinking categories. Our analysis reveals that Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to detect these instances in a zero-shot setting. However, instruction-based fine-tuning on our dataset significantly boosts performance by 10-20 performance points, highlighting the importance of high-quality training data. Furthermore, a controlled experiment demonstrates that reviews revised with lazy thinking feedback are more comprehensive and actionable than those written without such feedback. We will release our dataset and the enhanced guidelines that can be used to train junior reviewers in the community. (Code available here:this https URL)

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves Large Language Model (LLM) performance on knowledge-intensive tasks but depends heavily on initial search query quality. Current methods, often using Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically focus on query formulation or reasoning over results, without explicitly encouraging persistence after a failed search. We introduce ReZero (Retry-Zero), a novel RL framework that directly rewards the act of retrying a search query following an initial unsuccessful attempt. This incentivizes the LLM to explore alternative queries rather than prematurely halting. ReZero demonstrates significant improvement, achieving 46.88% accuracy compared to a 25% baseline. By rewarding persistence, ReZero enhances LLM robustness in complex information-seeking scenarios where initial queries may prove insufficient.

  The ability of cross-lingual context retrieval is a fundamental aspect of cross-lingual alignment of large language models (LLMs), where the model extracts context information in one language based on requests in another language. Despite its importance in real-life applications, this ability has not been adequately investigated for state-of-the-art models. In this paper, we evaluate the cross-lingual context retrieval ability of over 40 LLMs across 12 languages to understand the source of this ability, using cross-lingual machine reading comprehension (xMRC) as a representative scenario. Our results show that several small, post-trained open LLMs show strong cross-lingual context retrieval ability, comparable to closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4o, and their estimated oracle performances greatly improve after post-training. Our interpretability analysis shows that the cross-lingual context retrieval process can be divided into two main phases: question encoding and answer retrieval, which are formed in pre-training and post-training, respectively. The phasing stability correlates with xMRC performance, and the xMRC bottleneck lies at the last model layers in the second phase, where the effect of post-training can be evidently observed. Our results also indicate that larger-scale pretraining cannot improve the xMRC performance. Instead, larger LLMs need further multilingual post-training to fully unlock their cross-lingual context retrieval potential. Our code and is available atthis https URL

  Determining and ranking the most salient entities in a text is critical for user-facing systems, especially as users increasingly rely on models to interpret long documents they only partially read. Graded entity salience addresses this need by assigning entities scores that reflect their relative importance in a text. Existing approaches fall into two main categories: subjective judgments of salience, which allow for gradient scoring but lack consistency, and summarization-based methods, which define salience as mention-worthiness in a summary, promoting explainability but limiting outputs to binary labels (entities are either summary-worthy or not). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for graded entity salience that combines the strengths of both approaches. Using an English dataset spanning 12 spoken and written genres, we collect 5 summaries per document and calculate each entity's salience score based on its presence across these summaries. Our approach shows stronger correlation with scores based on human summaries and alignments, and outperforms existing techniques, including LLMs. We release our data and code atthis https URLto support further research on graded salient entity extraction.

  While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced performance across diverse natural language tasks, the high computational and financial costs associated with their deployment remain substantial barriers. Existing routing strategies partially alleviate this challenge by assigning queries to cheaper or specialized models, but they frequently rely on extensive labeled data or fragile task-specific heuristics. Conversely, fusion techniques aggregate multiple LLM outputs to boost accuracy and robustness, yet they often exacerbate cost and may reinforce shared biases.We introduce EMAFusion, a new framework that self-optimizes for seamless LLM selection and reliable execution for a given query. Specifically, EMAFusion integrates a taxonomy-based router for familiar query types, a learned router for ambiguous inputs, and a cascading approach that progressively escalates from cheaper to more expensive models based on multi-judge confidence evaluations. Through extensive evaluations, we find EMAFusion outperforms the best individual models by over 2.6 percentage points (94.3% vs. 91.7%), while being 4X cheaper than the average cost. EMAFusion further achieves a remarkable 17.1 percentage point improvement over models like GPT-4 at less than 1/20th the cost. Our combined routing approach delivers 94.3% accuracy compared to taxonomy-based (88.1%) and learned model predictor-based (91.7%) methods alone, demonstrating the effectiveness of our unified strategy. Finally, EMAFusion supports flexible cost-accuracy trade-offs, allowing users to balance their budgetary constraints and performance needs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models rely on semantic priors to perform in-context learning, which leads to poor performance on tasks involving inductive reasoning. Instruction-tuning methods based on imitation learning can superficially enhance the in-context learning performance of language models, but they often fail to improve the model's understanding of the underlying rules that connect inputs and outputs in few-shot demonstrations. We propose ReDis, a reasoning distillation technique designed to improve the inductive reasoning capabilities of language models. Through a careful combination of data augmentation, filtering, supervised fine-tuning, and alignment, ReDis achieves significant performance improvements across a diverse range of tasks, including 1D-ARC, List Function, ACRE, and MiniSCAN. Experiments on three language model backbones show that ReDis outperforms equivalent few-shot prompting baselines across all tasks and even surpasses the teacher model, GPT-4o, in some cases. ReDis, based on the LLaMA-3 backbone, achieves relative improvements of 23.2%, 2.8%, and 66.6% over GPT-4o on 1D-ARC, ACRE, and MiniSCAN, respectively, within a similar hypothesis search space. The code, dataset, and model checkpoints will be made available atthis https URL.

  _Thilo Hagendorff, Sarah Fabi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) can perform reasoning computations both internally within their latent space and externally by generating explicit token sequences like chains of thought. Significant progress in enhancing reasoning abilities has been made by scaling test-time compute. However, understanding and quantifying model-internal reasoning abilities - the inferential "leaps" models make between individual token predictions - remains crucial. This study introduces a benchmark (n = 4,000 items) designed to quantify model-internal reasoning in different domains. We achieve this by having LLMs indicate the correct solution to reasoning problems not through descriptive text, but by selecting a specific language of their initial response token that is different from English, the benchmark language. This not only requires models to reason beyond their context window, but also to overrise their default tendency to respond in the same language as the prompt, thereby posing an additional cognitive strain. We evaluate a set of 18 LLMs, showing significant performance variations, with GPT-4.5 achieving the highest accuracy (74.7%), outperforming models like Grok-2 (67.2%), and Llama 3.1 405B (65.6%). Control experiments and difficulty scaling analyses suggest that while LLMs engage in internal reasoning, we cannot rule out heuristic exploitations under certain conditions, marking an area for future investigation. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can "think" via latent-space computations, revealing model-internal inference strategies that need further understanding, especially regarding safety-related concerns such as covert planning, goal-seeking, or deception emerging without explicit token traces.

  Checkboxes are critical in real-world document processing where the presence or absence of ticks directly informs data extraction and decision-making processes. Yet, despite the strong performance of Large Vision and Language Models across a wide range of tasks, they struggle with interpreting checkable content. This challenge becomes particularly pressing in industries where a single overlooked checkbox may lead to costly regulatory or contractual oversights. To address this gap, we introduce the CheckboxQA dataset, a targeted resource designed to evaluate and improve model performance on checkbox-related tasks. It reveals the limitations of current models and serves as a valuable tool for advancing document comprehension systems, with significant implications for applications in sectors such as legal tech and finance.The dataset is publicly available at:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present MultiLoKo, a new benchmark for evaluating multilinguality in LLMs covering 31 languages. MultiLoKo consists of three partitions: a main partition consisting of 500 questions per language, separately sourced to be locally relevant to the specific language, and two translated partitions, containing human-authored translations from 30 non-English languages to English and vice versa. For comparison, we also release corresponding machine-authored translations. The data is equally distributed over two splits: a dev split and a blind, out-of-distribution test split. MultiLoKo can be used to study a variety of questions regarding the multilinguality of LLMs as well as meta-questions about multilingual benchmark creation. We compute MultiLoKo scores for 11 base and chat models marketed to be multilingual and study their average performance, their performance parity across languages, how much their ability to answer questions depends on the question language, and which languages are most difficult. None of the models we studied performs well on MultiLoKo, as indicated by low average scores as well as large differences between the best and worst scoring languages. Furthermore, we find a substantial effect of the question language, indicating sub-optimal knowledge transfer between languages. Lastly, we find that using local vs English-translated data can result in differences more than 20 points for the best performing models, drastically change the estimated difficulty of some languages. For using machines instead of human translations, we find a weaker effect on ordering of language difficulty, a larger difference in model rankings, and a substantial drop in estimated performance for all models.

  Current multimodal benchmarks often conflate reasoning with domain-specific knowledge, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate general reasoning abilities in non-expert settings. To address this, we introduce VisualPuzzles, a benchmark that targets visual reasoning while deliberately minimizing reliance on specialized knowledge. VisualPuzzles consists of diverse questions spanning five categories: algorithmic, analogical, deductive, inductive, and spatial reasoning. One major source of our questions is manually translated logical reasoning questions from the Chinese Civil Service Examination. Experiments show that VisualPuzzles requires significantly less intensive domain-specific knowledge and more complex reasoning compared to benchmarks like MMMU, enabling us to better evaluate genuine multimodal reasoning. Evaluations show that state-of-the-art multimodal large language models consistently lag behind human performance on VisualPuzzles, and that strong performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks does not necessarily translate to success on reasoning-focused, knowledge-light tasks. Additionally, reasoning enhancements such as scaling up inference compute (with "thinking" modes) yield inconsistent gains across models and task types, and we observe no clear correlation between model size and performance. We also found that models exhibit different reasoning and answering patterns on VisualPuzzles compared to benchmarks with heavier emphasis on knowledge. VisualPuzzles offers a clearer lens through which to evaluate reasoning capabilities beyond factual recall and domain knowledge.

  Large language models (LLMs) pre-trained predominantly on English text exhibit surprising multilingual capabilities, yet the mechanisms driving cross-lingual generalization remain poorly understood. This work investigates how the alignment of representations for text written in different languages correlates with LLM performance on natural language understanding tasks and translation tasks, both at the language and the instance level. For this purpose, we introduce cross-lingual alignment metrics such as the Discriminative Alignment Index (DALI) to quantify the alignment at an instance level for discriminative tasks. Through experiments on three natural language understanding tasks (Belebele, XStoryCloze, XCOPA), and machine translation, we find that while cross-lingual alignment metrics strongly correlate with task accuracy at the language level, the sample-level alignment often fails to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions, exposing alignment as a necessary but insufficient condition for success.

  Collaborative assistants, or chatbots, are data-driven decision support systems that enable natural interaction for task completion. While they can meet critical needs in modern society, concerns about their reliability and trustworthiness persist. In particular, Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek are becoming more accessible. However, such chatbots have limitations, including their inability to explain response generation, the risk of generating problematic content, the lack of standardized testing for reliability, and the need for deep AI expertise and extended development times. These issues make chatbots unsuitable for trust-sensitive applications like elections or healthcare. To address these concerns, we introduce SafeChat, a general architecture for building safe and trustworthy chatbots, with a focus on information retrieval use cases. Key features of SafeChat include: (a) safety, with a domain-agnostic design where responses are grounded and traceable to approved sources (provenance), and 'do-not-respond' strategies to prevent harmful answers; (b) usability, with automatic extractive summarization of long responses, traceable to their sources, and automated trust assessments to communicate expected chatbot behavior, such as sentiment; and (c) fast, scalable development, including a CSV-driven workflow, automated testing, and integration with various devices. We implemented SafeChat in an executable framework using the open-source chatbot platform Rasa. A case study demonstrates its application in building ElectionBot-SC, a chatbot designed to safely disseminate official election information. SafeChat is being used in many domains, validating its potential, and is available at:this https URL.

  Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have dominated much of the artificial intelligence scene with their ability to process and generate natural languages. However, the majority of LLM research and development remains English-centric, leaving low-resource languages such as those in the Southeast Asian (SEA) region under-represented. To address this representation gap, we introduce Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B-IT and Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B-IT, two cutting-edge multilingual LLMs designed for SEA languages. The SEA-LION family of LLMs supports 11 SEA languages, namely English, Chinese, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Malay, Thai, Burmese, Lao, Filipino, Tamil, and Khmer. Our work leverages large-scale multilingual continued pre-training with a comprehensive post-training regime involving multiple stages of instruction fine-tuning, alignment, and model merging. Evaluation results on multilingual benchmarks indicate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across LLMs supporting SEA languages. We open-source the models to benefit the wider SEA community.

  Long-form generation is crucial for a wide range of practical applications, typically categorized into short-to-long and long-to-long generation. While short-to-long generations have received considerable attention, generating long texts from extremely long resources remains relatively underexplored. The primary challenge in long-to-long generation lies in effectively integrating and analyzing relevant information from extensive inputs, which remains difficult for current large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2, a novel test-time scaling strategy designed to enhance the ability of LLMs to process extremely long inputs. Drawing inspiration from convolutional neural networks, which iteratively integrate local features into higher-level global representations, LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2 utilizes stacked convolutional scaling layers to progressively expand the understanding of input materials. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the ability of LLMs to process long inputs and generate coherent, informative long-form articles, outperforming several representative baselines. Both LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2 and SurveyEval are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has seen increasing adoption in healthcare, with specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging to support clinical applications. A fundamental requirement for these models is accurate identification of TCM drug ingredients. In this paper, we evaluate how general and TCM-specialized LLMs perform when identifying ingredients of Chinese drugs. Our systematic analysis reveals consistent failure patterns: models often interpret drug names literally, overuse common herbs regardless of relevance, and exhibit erratic behaviors when faced with unfamiliar formulations. LLMs also fail to understand the verification task. These findings demonstrate that current LLMs rely primarily on drug names rather than possessing systematic pharmacological knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach focused on ingredient names. Experiments across 220 TCM formulations show our method significantly improves accuracy from approximately 50% to 82% in ingredient verification tasks. Our work highlights critical weaknesses in current TCM-specific LLMs and offers a practical solution for enhancing their clinical reliability.

  Language model post-training is applied to refine behaviors and unlock new skills across a wide range of recent language models, but open recipes for applying these techniques lag behind proprietary ones. The underlying training data and recipes for post-training are simultaneously the most important pieces of the puzzle and the portion with the least transparency. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tulu 3, a family of fully-open state-of-the-art post-trained models, alongside its data, code, and training recipes, serving as a comprehensive guide for modern post-training techniques. Tulu 3, which builds on Llama 3.1 base models, achieves results surpassing the instruct versions of Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral, and even closed models such as GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5-Haiku. The training algorithms for our models include supervised finetuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a novel method we call Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). With Tulu 3, we introduce a multi-task evaluation scheme for post-training recipes with development and unseen evaluations, standard benchmark implementations, and substantial decontamination of existing open datasets on said benchmarks. We conclude with analysis and discussion of training methods that did not reliably improve performance.In addition to the Tulu 3 model weights and demo, we release the complete recipe -- including datasets for diverse core skills, a robust toolkit for data curation and evaluation, the training code and infrastructure, and, most importantly, a detailed report for reproducing and further adapting the Tulu 3 approach to more domains.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been widely adopted for preference alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, DPO is derived as a bandit problem in which the whole response is treated as a single arm, ignoring the importance differences between tokens, which may affect optimization efficiency and make it difficult to achieve optimal results. In this work, we propose that the optimal data for DPO has equal expected rewards for each token in winning and losing responses, as there is no difference in token importance. However, since the optimal dataset is unavailable in practice, we propose using the original dataset for importance sampling to achieve unbiased optimization. Accordingly, we propose a token-level importance sampling DPO objective named TIS-DPO that assigns importance weights to each token based on its reward. Inspired by previous works, we estimate the token importance weights using the difference in prediction probabilities from a pair of contrastive LLMs. We explore three methods to construct these contrastive LLMs: (1) guiding the original LLM with contrastive prompts, (2) training two separate LLMs using winning and losing responses, and (3) performing forward and reverse DPO training with winning and losing responses. Experiments show that TIS-DPO significantly outperforms various baseline methods on harmlessness and helpfulness alignment and summarization tasks. We also visualize the estimated weights, demonstrating their ability to identify key token positions.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI), leading to the development of increasingly large models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-405B. However, scaling up model sizes results in exponentially higher computational costs and energy consumption, making these models impractical for academic researchers and businesses with limited resources. At the same time, Small Models (SMs) are frequently used in practical settings, although their significance is currently underestimated. This raises important questions about the role of small models in the era of LLMs, a topic that has received limited attention in prior research. In this work, we systematically examine the relationship between LLMs and SMs from two key perspectives: Collaboration and Competition. We hope this survey provides valuable insights for practitioners, fostering a deeper understanding of the contribution of small models and promoting more efficient use of computational resources.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown great progress in responding to user questions, allowing for a multitude of diverse applications. Yet, the quality of LLM outputs heavily depends on the prompt design, where a good prompt might enable the LLM to answer a very challenging question correctly. Therefore, recent works have developed many strategies for improving the prompt, including both manual crafting and in-domain optimization. However, their efficacy in unrestricted scenarios remains questionable, as the former depends on human design for specific questions and the latter usually generalizes poorly to unseen scenarios. To address these problems, we give LLMs the freedom to design the best prompts according to themselves. Specifically, we include a hierarchy of LLMs, first constructing a prompt with precise instructions and accurate wording in a hierarchical manner, and then using this prompt to generate the final answer to the user query. We term this pipeline Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflow, or HMAW. In contrast with prior works, HMAW imposes no human restriction and requires no training, and is completely task-agnostic while capable of adjusting to the nuances of the underlying task. Through both quantitative and qualitative experiments across multiple benchmarks, we verify that despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can create detailed and suitable prompts, further boosting the performance of current LLMs.

  This paper proposes SafeGPT, a two-tiered framework that integrates generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for efficient and reliable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) last-mile deliveries. In the proposed design, a Global GPT module assigns high-level tasks such as sector allocation, while an On-Device GPT manages real-time local route planning. An RL-based safety filter monitors each GPT decision and overrides unsafe actions that could lead to battery depletion or duplicate visits, effectively mitigating hallucinations. Furthermore, a dual replay buffer mechanism helps both the GPT modules and the RL agent refine their strategies over time. Simulation results demonstrate that SafeGPT achieves higher delivery success rates compared to a GPT-only baseline, while substantially reducing battery consumption and travel distance. These findings validate the efficacy of combining GPT-based semantic reasoning with formal safety guarantees, contributing a viable solution for robust and energy-efficient UAV logistics.

  In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of the projected Bellman equation (PBE) and two algorithms to solve this equation: linear Q-learning and approximate value iteration (AVI). We consider two sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution to PBE : strictly negatively row dominating diagonal (SNRDD) assumption and a condition motivated by the convergence of AVI. The SNRDD assumption also ensures the convergence of linear Q-learning, and its relationship with the convergence of AVI is examined. Lastly, several interesting observations on the solution of PBE are provided when using $\epsilon$-greedy policy.

  AI Agents powered by Large Language Models are transforming the world through enormous applications. A super agent has the potential to fulfill diverse user needs, such as summarization, coding, and research, by accurately understanding user intent and leveraging the appropriate tools to solve tasks. However, to make such an agent viable for real-world deployment and accessible at scale, significant optimizations are required to ensure high efficiency and low cost. This paper presents a design of the Super Agent System. Upon receiving a user prompt, the system first detects the intent of the user, then routes the request to specialized task agents with the necessary tools or automatically generates agentic workflows. In practice, most applications directly serve as AI assistants on edge devices such as phones and robots. As different language models vary in capability and cloud-based models often entail high computational costs, latency, and privacy concerns, we then explore the hybrid mode where the router dynamically selects between local and cloud models based on task complexity. Finally, we introduce the blueprint of an on-device super agent enhanced with cloud. With advances in multi-modality models and edge hardware, we envision that most computations can be handled locally, with cloud collaboration only as needed. Such architecture paves the way for super agents to be seamlessly integrated into everyday life in the near future.

  We study the automated derivation of safety requirements in a self-driving vehicle use case, leveraging LLMs in combination with agent-based retrieval-augmented generation. Conventional approaches that utilise pre-trained LLMs to assist in safety analyses typically lack domain-specific knowledge. Existing RAG approaches address this issue, yet their performance deteriorates when handling complex queries and it becomes increasingly harder to retrieve the most relevant information. This is particularly relevant for safety-relevant applications. In this paper, we propose the use of agent-based RAG to derive safety requirements and show that the retrieved information is more relevant to the queries. We implement an agent-based approach on a document pool of automotive standards and the Apollo case study, as a representative example of an automated driving perception system. Our solution is tested on a data set of safety requirement questions and answers, extracted from the Apollo data. Evaluating a set of selected RAG metrics, we present and discuss advantages of a agent-based approach compared to default RAG methods.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with web search capabilities have demonstrated impressive potential for deep research tasks. However, current approaches predominantly rely on either manually engineered prompts (prompt engineering-based) with brittle performance or reinforcement learning within controlled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) environments (RAG-based) that fail to capture the complexities of real-world interaction. In this paper, we introduce DeepResearcher, the first comprehensive framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based deep research agents through scaling reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world environments with authentic web search interactions. Unlike RAG-based approaches that assume all necessary information exists within a fixed corpus, our method trains agents to navigate the noisy, unstructured, and dynamic nature of the open web. We implement a specialized multi-agent architecture where browsing agents extract relevant information from various webpage structures and overcoming significant technical challenges. Extensive experiments on open-domain research tasks demonstrate that DeepResearcher achieves substantial improvements of up to 28.9 points over prompt engineering-based baselines and up to 7.2 points over RAG-based RL agents. Our qualitative analysis reveals emergent cognitive behaviors from end-to-end RL training, including the ability to formulate plans, cross-validate information from multiple sources, engage in self-reflection to redirect research, and maintain honesty when unable to find definitive answers. Our results highlight that end-to-end training in real-world web environments is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental requirement for developing robust research capabilities aligned with real-world applications.

  In the field of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), common methods typically involve unfreezing the language model during training to foster profound visual understanding. However, the fine-tuning of such models with vision-language data often leads to a diminution of their natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. To avoid this performance degradation, a straightforward solution is to freeze the language model while developing multimodal competencies. Unfortunately, previous works have not attained satisfactory outcomes. Building on the strategy of freezing the language model, we conduct thorough structural exploration and introduce the Inner-Adaptor Architecture (IAA). Specifically, the architecture incorporates multiple multimodal adaptors at varying depths within the large language model to facilitate direct interaction with the inherently text-oriented transformer layers, thereby enabling the frozen language model to acquire multimodal capabilities. Unlike previous approaches of freezing language models that require large-scale aligned data, our proposed architecture is able to achieve superior performance on small-scale datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to improve the general multimodal capabilities and visual grounding abilities of the MLLM. Our approach remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across various vision-language benchmarks without sacrificing performance on NLP tasks. Code and models are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models can be used to solve long-horizon planning problems in two distinct modes: a fast 'System-1' mode, directly generating plans without any explicit search or backtracking, and a slow 'System-2' mode, planning step-by-step by explicitly searching over possible actions. While System-2 is typically more effective, it is also more computationally expensive, making it infeasible for long plans or large action spaces. Moreover, isolated System-1 or 2 ignores the user's end goals, failing to provide ways to control the model's behavior. To this end, we propose the System-1.x Planner, a controllable planning framework with LLMs that is capable of generating hybrid plans and balancing between the two planning modes based on the difficulty of the problem at hand. System-1.x consists of (i) a controller, (ii) a System-1 Planner, and (iii) a System-2 Planner. Based on a user-specified hybridization factor (x) governing the mixture between System-1 and 2, the controller decomposes a problem into sub-goals, and classifies them as easy or hard to be solved by either System-1 or 2, respectively. We fine-tune all three components on top of a single base LLM, requiring only search traces as supervision. Experiments with two diverse planning tasks -- Maze Navigation and Blocksworld -- show that our System-1.x Planner outperforms a System-1 Planner, a System-2 Planner trained to approximate A* search, and also a symbolic planner (A*). We demonstrate the following key properties of our planner: (1) controllability: increasing the hybridization factor (e.g., System-1.75 vs 1.5) performs more search, improving performance, (2) flexibility: by building a neuro-symbolic variant with a neural System-1 and a symbolic System-2, we can use existing symbolic methods, and (3) generalizability: by being able to learn from different search algorithms, our method is robust to the choice of search algorithm.

  Reasoning is the fundamental capability of large language models (LLMs). Due to the rapid progress of LLMs, there are two main issues of current benchmarks: i) these benchmarks can be crushed in a short time (less than 1 year), and ii) these benchmarks may be easily hacked. To handle these issues, we propose the ever-scalingness for building the benchmarks which are uncrushable, unhackable, auto-verifiable and general. This paper presents Nondeterministic Polynomial-time Problem Challenge (NPPC), an ever-scaling reasoning benchmark for LLMs. Specifically, the NPPC has three main modules: i) npgym, which provides a unified interface of 25 well-known NP-complete problems and can generate any number of instances with any levels of complexities, ii) npsolver: which provides a unified interface to evaluate the problem instances with both online and offline models via APIs and local deployments, respectively, and iii) npeval: which provides the comprehensive and ready-to-use tools to analyze the performances of LLMs over different problems, the number of tokens, the aha moments, the reasoning errors and the solution errors. Extensive experiments over widely-used LLMs demonstrate: i) NPPC can successfully decrease the performances of advanced LLMs' performances to below 10%, demonstrating that NPPC is uncrushable, ii) DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and o1/o3-mini are the most powerful LLMs, where DeepSeek-R1 outperforms Claude-3.7-Sonnet and o1/o3-mini in most NP-complete problems considered, and iii) the numbers of tokens, aha moments in the advanced LLMs, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet and DeepSeek-R1, are observed first to increase and then decrease when the problem instances become more and more difficult. We believe that NPPC is the first ever-scaling reasoning benchmark, serving as the uncrushable and unhackable testbed for LLMs toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).

  Recent advances in Large Language Models have demonstrated their capabilities across a variety of tasks. However, automatically extracting implicit knowledge from natural language remains a significant challenge, as machines lack active experience with the physical world. Given this scenario, semantic knowledge graphs can serve as conceptual spaces that guide the automated text generation reasoning process to achieve more efficient and explainable results. In this paper, we apply a logic-augmented generation (LAG) framework that leverages the explicit representation of a text through a semantic knowledge graph and applies it in combination with prompt heuristics to elicit implicit analogical connections. This method generates extended knowledge graph triples representing implicit meaning, enabling systems to reason on unlabeled multimodal data regardless of the domain. We validate our work through three metaphor detection and understanding tasks across four datasets, as they require deep analogical reasoning capabilities. The results show that this integrated approach surpasses current baselines, performs better than humans in understanding visual metaphors, and enables more explainable reasoning processes, though still has inherent limitations in metaphor understanding, especially for domain-specific metaphors. Furthermore, we propose a thorough error analysis, discussing issues with metaphorical annotations and current evaluation methods.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities and are receiving increasing attention to enhance their reasoning through scaling test--time compute. However, their application in open--ended, knowledge--intensive, complex reasoning scenarios is still limited. Reasoning--oriented methods struggle to generalize to open--ended scenarios due to implicit assumptions of complete world knowledge. Meanwhile, knowledge--augmented reasoning (KAR) methods fail to address two core challenges: 1) error propagation, where errors in early steps cascade through the chain, and 2) verification bottleneck, where the explore--exploit tradeoff arises in multi--branch decision processes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ARise, a novel framework that integrates risk assessment of intermediate reasoning states with dynamic retrieval--augmented generation (RAG) within a Monte Carlo tree search paradigm. This approach enables effective construction and optimization of reasoning plans across multiple maintained hypothesis branches. Experimental results show that ARise significantly outperforms the state--of--the--art KAR methods by up to 23.10%, and the latest RAG-equipped large reasoning models by up to 25.37%.

  We introduce Kimina-Prover Preview, a large language model that pioneers a novel reasoning-driven exploration paradigm for formal theorem proving, as showcased in this preview release. Trained with a large-scale reinforcement learning pipeline from Qwen2.5-72B, Kimina-Prover demonstrates strong performance in Lean 4 proof generation by employing a structured reasoning pattern we term \textit{formal reasoning pattern}. This approach allows the model to emulate human problem-solving strategies in Lean, iteratively generating and refining proof steps. Kimina-Prover sets a new state-of-the-art on the miniF2F benchmark, reaching 80.7% with pass@8192. Beyond improved benchmark performance, our work yields several key insights: (1) Kimina-Prover exhibits high sample efficiency, delivering strong results even with minimal sampling (pass@1) and scaling effectively with computational budget, stemming from its unique reasoning pattern and RL training; (2) we demonstrate clear performance scaling with model size, a trend previously unobserved for neural theorem provers in formal mathematics; (3) the learned reasoning style, distinct from traditional search algorithms, shows potential to bridge the gap between formal verification and informal mathematical intuition. We open source distilled versions with 1.5B and 7B parameters of Kimina-Prover

  Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities across a wide range of tasks, and their application in the medical domain holds particular promise due to the demand for high generalizability and reliance on interdisciplinary knowledge. However, existing medical agent systems often rely on static, manually crafted workflows that lack the flexibility to accommodate diverse diagnostic requirements and adapt to emerging clinical scenarios. Motivated by the success of automated machine learning (AutoML), this paper introduces a novel framework for the automated design of medical agent architectures. Specifically, we define a hierarchical and expressive agent search space that enables dynamic workflow adaptation through structured modifications at the node, structural, and framework levels. Our framework conceptualizes medical agents as graph-based architectures composed of diverse, functional node types and supports iterative self-improvement guided by diagnostic feedback. Experimental results on skin disease diagnosis tasks demonstrate that the proposed method effectively evolves workflow structures and significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy over time. This work represents the first fully automated framework for medical agent architecture design and offers a scalable, adaptable foundation for deploying intelligent agents in real-world clinical environments.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs have been remarkable. However, these models still rely solely on their parametric knowledge, which limits their ability to generate up-to-date information and increases the risk of producing erroneous content. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially mitigates these challenges by incorporating external data sources, yet the reliance on databases and retrieval systems can introduce irrelevant or inaccurate documents, ultimately undermining both performance and reasoning quality. In this paper, we propose Multi-Modal Knowledge-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMKB-RAG), a novel multi-modal RAG framework that leverages the inherent knowledge boundaries of models to dynamically generate semantic tags for the retrieval process. This strategy enables the joint filtering of retrieved documents, retaining only the most relevant and accurate references. Extensive experiments on knowledge-based visual question-answering tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach: on the E-VQA dataset, our method improves performance by +4.2% on the Single-Hop subset and +0.4% on the full dataset, while on the InfoSeek dataset, it achieves gains of +7.8% on the Unseen-Q subset, +8.2% on the Unseen-E subset, and +8.1% on the full dataset. These results highlight significant enhancements in both accuracy and robustness over the current state-of-the-art MLLM and RAG frameworks.

  This paper presents a simple, effective, and cost-efficient strategy to improve LLM performance by scaling test-time compute. Our strategy builds upon the repeated-sampling-then-voting framework, with a novel twist: incorporating multiple models, even weaker ones, to leverage their complementary strengths that potentially arise from diverse training data and paradigms. By using consistency as a signal, our strategy dynamically switches between models. Theoretical analysis highlights the efficiency and performance advantages of our strategy. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our strategy not only outperforms self-consistency and state-of-the-art multi-agent debate approaches, but also significantly reduces inference costs. Additionally, ModelSwitch requires only a few comparable LLMs to achieve optimal performance and can be extended with verification methods, demonstrating the potential of leveraging multiple LLMs in the generation-verification paradigm.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the development of intelligent LLM-based agents capable of interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). These agents demonstrate strong reasoning and adaptability, enabling them to perform complex tasks that traditionally required predefined rules. However, the reliance on step-by-step reasoning in LLM-based agents often results in inefficiencies, particularly for routine tasks. In contrast, traditional rule-based systems excel in efficiency but lack the intelligence and flexibility to adapt to novel scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel evolutionary framework for GUI agents that enhances operational efficiency while retaining intelligence and flexibility. Our approach incorporates a memory mechanism that records the agent's task execution history. By analyzing this history, the agent identifies repetitive action sequences and evolves high-level actions that act as shortcuts, replacing these low-level operations and improving efficiency. This allows the agent to focus on tasks requiring more complex reasoning, while simplifying routine actions. Experimental results on multiple benchmark tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both efficiency and accuracy. The code will be open-sourced to support further research.

  Identifying reliable synthesis pathways in materials chemistry is a complex task, particularly in polymer science, due to the intricate and often non-unique nomenclature of macromolecules. To address this challenge, we propose an agent system that integrates large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs. By leveraging LLMs' powerful capabilities for extracting and recognizing chemical substance names, and storing the extracted data in a structured knowledge graph, our system fully automates the retrieval of relevant literatures, extraction of reaction data, database querying, construction of retrosynthetic pathway trees, further expansion through the retrieval of additional literature and recommendation of optimal reaction pathways. By considering the complex interdependencies among chemical reactants, a novel Multi-branched Reaction Pathway Search Algorithm (MBRPS) is proposed to help identify all valid multi-branched reaction pathways, which arise when a single product decomposes into multiple reaction intermediates. In contrast, previous studies were limited to cases where a product decomposes into at most one reaction intermediate. This work represents the first attempt to develop a fully automated retrosynthesis planning agent tailored specially for macromolecules powered by LLMs. Applied to polyimide synthesis, our new approach constructs a retrosynthetic pathway tree with hundreds of pathways and recommends optimized routes, including both known and novel pathways. This demonstrates utilizing LLMs for literature consultation to accomplish specific tasks is possible and crucial for future materials research, given the vast amount of materials-related literature.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This booklet, Unlocking the Wisdom of Multi-LLM Collaborative Intelligence, serves as an accessible introduction to the full volume The Path to Artificial General Intelligence. Through fourteen aphorisms, it distills the core principles of Multi-LLM Agent Collaborative Intelligence (MACI), a framework designed to coordinate multiple LLMs toward reasoning, planning, and decision-making that surpasses the capabilities of any single model. The booklet includes titles, abstracts, and introductions from each main chapter, along with the full content of the first two. The newly released third edition features significant enhancements to Chapters 6 through 9 and a revised preface responding to Yann LeCun's critique of AGI feasibility. While LeCun argues that LLMs lack grounding, memory, and planning, we propose that MACI's collaborative architecture, featuring multimodal agents in executive, legislative, and judicial roles, directly addresses these limitations. Chapters on SocraSynth, EVINCE, consciousness modeling, and behavior regulation demonstrate that reasoning systems grounded in structured interaction and checks and balances can produce more reliable, interpretable, and adaptive intelligence. By integrating complementary model strengths, including world modeling and multimodal perception, MACI enables a system-level intelligence that exceeds the sum of its parts. Like human institutions, progress in AI may depend less on isolated performance and more on coordinated judgment. Collaborative LLMs, not just larger ones, may chart the path toward artificial general intelligence.
