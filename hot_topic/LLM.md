- **[RoboTwin: Dual-Arm Robot Benchmark with Generative Digital Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13059)**  `arXiv:2504.13059`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  In the rapidly advancing field of robotics, dual-arm coordination and complex object manipulation are essential capabilities for developing advanced autonomous systems. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality demonstration data and real-world-aligned evaluation benchmarks severely limits such development. To address this, we introduce RoboTwin, a generative digital twin framework that uses 3D generative foundation models and large language models to produce diverse expert datasets and provide a real-world-aligned evaluation platform for dual-arm robotic tasks. Specifically, RoboTwin creates varied digital twins of objects from single 2D images, generating realistic and interactive scenarios. It also introduces a spatial relation-aware code generation framework that combines object annotations with large language models to break down tasks, determine spatial constraints, and generate precise robotic movement code. Our framework offers a comprehensive benchmark with both simulated and real-world data, enabling standardized evaluation and better alignment between simulated training and real-world performance. We validated our approach using the open-source COBOT Magic Robot platform. Policies pre-trained on RoboTwin-generated data and fine-tuned with limited real-world samples demonstrate significant potential for enhancing dual-arm robotic manipulation systems by improving success rates by over 70% for single-arm tasks and over 40% for dual-arm tasks compared to models trained solely on real-world data.

- **[Trajectory Adaptation using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12755)**  `arXiv:2504.12755`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Anurag Maurya, Tashmoy Ghosh, Ravi Prakash_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adapting robot trajectories based on human instructions as per new situations is essential for achieving more intuitive and scalable human-robot interactions. This work proposes a flexible language-based framework to adapt generic robotic trajectories produced by off-the-shelf motion planners like RRT, A-star, etc, or learned from human demonstrations. We utilize pre-trained LLMs to adapt trajectory waypoints by generating code as a policy for dense robot manipulation, enabling more complex and flexible instructions than current methods. This approach allows us to incorporate a broader range of commands, including numerical inputs. Compared to state-of-the-art feature-based sequence-to-sequence models which require training, our method does not require task-specific training and offers greater interpretability and more effective feedback mechanisms. We validate our approach through simulation experiments on the robotic manipulator, aerial vehicle, and ground robot in the Pybullet and Gazebo simulation environments, demonstrating that LLMs can successfully adapt trajectories to complex human instructions.

  _Runyu Ma, Jelle Luijkx, Zlatan Ajanovic, Jens Kober_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In robot manipulation, Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from low sample efficiency and uncertain convergence, especially in large observation and action spaces. Foundation Models (FMs) offer an alternative, demonstrating promise in zero-shot and few-shot settings. However, they can be unreliable due to limited physical and spatial understanding. We introduce ExploRLLM, a method that combines the strengths of both paradigms. In our approach, FMs improve RL convergence by generating policy code and efficient representations, while a residual RL agent compensates for the FMs' limited physical understanding. We show that ExploRLLM outperforms both policies derived from FMs and RL baselines in table-top manipulation tasks. Additionally, real-world experiments show that the policies exhibit promising zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. Supplementary material is available atthis https URL.

- **[QLLM: Do We Really Need a Mixing Network for Credit Assignment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12961)**  `arXiv:2504.12961`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhouyang Jiang, Bin Zhang, Airong Wei, Zhiwei Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Credit assignment has remained a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Previous studies have primarily addressed this issue through value decomposition methods under the centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm, where neural networks are utilized to approximate the nonlinear relationship between individual Q-values and the global Q-value. Although these approaches have achieved considerable success in various benchmark tasks, they still suffer from several limitations, including imprecise attribution of contributions, limited interpretability, and poor scalability in high-dimensional state spaces. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm, \textbf{QLLM}, which facilitates the automatic construction of credit assignment functions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the concept of \textbf{TFCAF} is introduced, wherein the credit allocation process is represented as a direct and expressive nonlinear functional formulation. A custom-designed \textit{coder-evaluator} framework is further employed to guide the generation, verification, and refinement of executable code by LLMs, significantly mitigating issues such as hallucination and shallow reasoning during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on several standard MARL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, QLLM exhibits strong generalization capability and maintains compatibility with a wide range of MARL algorithms that utilize mixing networks, positioning it as a promising and versatile solution for complex multi-agent scenarios.

- **[Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Prediction via Rule-Regularized Heteroscedastic Deep Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13111)**  `arXiv:2504.13111`  `cs.LG` `cs.RO`  
  _Kumar Manas, Christian Schlauch, Adrian Paschke, Christian Wirth, Nadja Klein_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher. Project page:this https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and have been applied across various scientific fields, including chemistry. However, many chemical tasks require the processing of visual information, which cannot be successfully handled by existing chemical LLMs. This brings a growing need for models capable of integrating multimodal information in the chemical domain. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ChemVLM}, an open-source chemical multimodal large language model specifically designed for chemical applications. ChemVLM is trained on a carefully curated bilingual multimodal dataset that enhances its ability to understand both textual and visual chemical information, including molecular structures, reactions, and chemistry examination questions. We develop three datasets for comprehensive evaluation, tailored to Chemical Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Chemical Reasoning (MMCR), and Multimodal Molecule Understanding tasks. We benchmark ChemVLM against a range of open-source and proprietary multimodal large language models on various tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ChemVLM achieves competitive performance across all evaluated tasks. Our model can be found atthis https URL.

- **[Activated LoRA: Fine-tuned LLMs for Intrinsics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12397)**  `arXiv:2504.12397`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Kristjan Greenewald, Luis Lastras, Thomas Parnell, Vraj Shah, Lucian Popa, Giulio Zizzo, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

- **[Unveiling Hidden Collaboration within Mixture-of-Experts in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12359)**  `arXiv:2504.12359`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yuanbo Tang, Yan Tang, Naifan Zhang, Meixuan Chen, Yang Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mixture-of-Experts based large language models (MoE LLMs) have shown significant promise in multitask adaptability by dynamically routing inputs to specialized experts. Despite their success, the collaborative mechanisms among experts are still not well understood, limiting both the interpretability and optimization of these models. In this paper, we focus on two critical issues: (1) identifying expert collaboration patterns, and (2) optimizing MoE LLMs through expert pruning. To address the first issue, we propose a hierarchical sparse dictionary learning (HSDL) method that uncovers the collaboration patterns among experts. For the second issue, we introduce the Contribution-Aware Expert Pruning (CAEP) algorithm, which effectively prunes low-contribution experts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that expert collaboration patterns are closely linked to specific input types and exhibit semantic significance across various tasks. Moreover, pruning experiments show that our approach improves overall performance by 2.5\% on average, outperforming existing methods. These findings offer valuable insights into enhancing the efficiency and interpretability of MoE LLMs, offering a clearer understanding of expert interactions and improving model optimization.

- **[GPG: A Simple and Strong Reinforcement Learning Baseline for Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02546)**  `arXiv:2504.02546`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Xiangxiang Chu, Hailang Huang, Xiao Zhang, Fei Wei, Yong Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) can directly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models without extensive reliance on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this work, we revisit the traditional Policy Gradient (PG) mechanism and propose a minimalist RL approach termed Group Policy Gradient (GPG). Unlike conventional methods, GPG directly optimize the original RL objective, thus obviating the need for surrogate loss functions. By eliminating the critic and reference models, avoiding KL divergence constraints, and addressing the advantage and gradient estimation bias, our approach significantly simplifies the training process compared to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach achieves superior performance without relying on auxiliary techniques or adjustments. As illustrated in Figure 1, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only reduces computational costs but also consistently outperforms GRPO across various unimodal and multimodal tasks.

- **[Large Language Models as Attribution Regularizers for Efficient Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20268)**  `arXiv:2502.20268`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Davor Vukadin, Marin ≈†iliƒá, Goran Delaƒç_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse domains. However, effectively leveraging their vast knowledge for training smaller downstream models remains an open challenge, especially in domains like tabular data learning, where simpler models are often preferred due to interpretability and efficiency.In this paper, we introduce a novel yet straightforward method for incorporating LLM-generated global task feature attributions into the training process of smaller networks. Specifically, we propose an attribution-matching regularization term that aligns the training dynamics of the smaller model with the insights provided by the LLM. By doing so, our approach yields superior performance in few-shot learning scenarios. Notably, our method requires only black-box API access to the LLM, making it easy to integrate into existing training pipelines with minimal computational overhead.Furthermore, we demonstrate how this method can be used to address common issues in real-world datasets, such as skewness and bias. By integrating high-level knowledge from LLMs, our approach improves generalization, even when training data is limited or imbalanced. We validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across multiple tasks, demonstrating improved learning efficiency and model robustness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We adapt alignment techniques from reasoning LLMs to the task of generating engineering sketch constraints found in computer-aided design (CAD) models. Engineering sketches consist of geometric primitives (e.g. points, lines) connected by constraints (e.g. perpendicular, tangent) that define the relationships between them. For a design to be easily editable, the constraints must effectively capture design intent, ensuring the geometry updates predictably when parameters change. Although current approaches can generate CAD designs, an open challenge remains to align model outputs with design intent, we label this problem `design alignment'. A critical first step towards aligning generative CAD models is to generate constraints which fully-constrain all geometric primitives, without over-constraining or distorting sketch geometry. Using alignment techniques to train an existing constraint generation model with feedback from a constraint solver, we are able to fully-constrain 93% of sketches compared to 34% when using a na√Øve supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baseline and only 8.9% without alignment. Our approach can be applied to any existing constraint generation model and sets the stage for further research bridging alignment strategies between the language and design domains.

  _Yu Wang, Fu-Chieh Chang, Pei-Yuan Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful technique to improve in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) by breaking complex reasoning into intermediate steps. However, the ability of CoT to generalize under distribution shift remains poorly understood. In this work, we extend a latent-variable framework for CoT prompting and study its behavior on two prototypical out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios: (i) the latent variables for CoT steps are permuted into novel combinations, and (ii) the latent variables uniformly scaled by a factor. Our experiments demonstrate that CoT inference generalizes effectively to OOD samples whose latent variables closely resemble those seen during training, but its performance degrades as this similarity decreases. These findings provide foundational insights into the strengths and limitations of CoT prompting under OOD conditions and suggest directions for developing more resilient reasoning strategies in future LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLM ensembles are widely used for LLM judges. However, how to estimate their accuracy, especially in an efficient way, is unknown. In this paper, we present a principled maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework for an economical and precise estimation of the performance of LLM ensemble judgment. We first propose a mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions to model the judgment distribution, revising from the vanilla Binomial distribution. Next, we introduce a conformal prediction-driven approach that enables adaptive stopping during iterative sampling to balance accuracy with efficiency. Furthermore, we design a prior transfer mechanism that utilizes learned distributions on open-source datasets to improve estimation on a target dataset when only scarce annotations are available. Finally, we present BetaConform, a framework that integrates our distribution assumption, adaptive stopping, and the prior transfer mechanism to deliver a theoretically guaranteed distribution estimation of LLM ensemble judgment with minimum labeled samples. BetaConform is also validated empirically. For instance, with only 10 samples from the TruthfulQA dataset, for a Llama ensembled judge, BetaConform gauges its performance with error margin as small as 3.37%.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Video Models (LVMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in video understanding but often suffer from misalignment with human intuition and video hallucination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce VistaDPO, a novel framework for Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Direct Preference Optimization. VistaDPO enhances text-video preference alignment across three hierarchical levels: i) Instance Level, aligning overall video content with responses; ii) Temporal Level, aligning video temporal semantics with event descriptions; and iii) Perceptive Level, aligning spatial objects with language tokens. Given the lack of datasets for fine-grained video-language preference alignment, we construct VistaDPO-7k, a dataset of 7.2K QA pairs annotated with chosen and rejected responses, along with spatial-temporal grounding information such as timestamps, keyframes, and bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Video Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioning performance tasks demonstrate that VistaDPO significantly improves the performance of existing LVMs, effectively mitigating video-language misalignment and hallucination. The code and data are available atthis https URL.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly progressed in offline video understanding. However, applying these models to real-world scenarios, such as autonomous driving and human-computer interaction, presents unique challenges due to the need for real-time processing of continuous online video streams. To this end, this paper presents systematic efforts from three perspectives: evaluation benchmark, model architecture, and training strategy. First, we introduce OVBench, a comprehensive question-answering benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to perceive, memorize, and reason within online video contexts. It features 6 core task types across three temporal contexts-past, current, and future-forming 16 subtasks from diverse datasets. Second, we propose a new Pyramid Memory Bank (PMB) that effectively retains key spatiotemporal information in video streams. Third, we proposed an offline-to-online learning paradigm, designing an interleaved dialogue format for online video data and constructing an instruction-tuning dataset tailored for online video training. This framework led to the development of VideoChat-Online, a robust and efficient model for online video understanding. Despite the lower computational cost and higher efficiency, VideoChat-Online outperforms existing state-of-the-art offline and online models across popular offline video benchmarks and OVBench, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model architecture and training strategy. % Our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art offline models Qwen2-VL 7B and online models Flash-VStream, by 4.19% and 23.7% on OVBench, respectively.

  Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence. However, visual reasoning, reasoning involving both visual and textual inputs, remains underexplored. Recent advancements, including the reasoning models like OpenAI o1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, which incorporate image inputs, have opened this capability. In this ongoing work, we focus specifically on photography-related tasks because a photo is a visual snapshot of the physical world where the underlying physics (i.e., illumination, blur extent, etc.) interplay with the camera parameters. Successfully reasoning from the visual information of a photo to identify these numerical camera settings requires the MLLMs to have a deeper understanding of the underlying physics for precise visual comprehension, representing a challenging and intelligent capability essential for practical applications like photography assistant agents. We aim to evaluate MLLMs on their ability to distinguish visual differences related to numerical camera settings, extending a methodology previously proposed for vision-language models (VLMs). Our preliminary results demonstrate the importance of visual reasoning in photography-related tasks. Moreover, these results show that no single MLLM consistently dominates across all evaluation tasks, demonstrating ongoing challenges and opportunities in developing MLLMs with better visual reasoning.

  The ability to combine existing concepts into novel ideas stands as a fundamental hallmark of human intelligence. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like GPT-4V and DALLE-3 have sparked debate about whether their outputs reflect combinational creativity--defined by M. A. Boden (1998) as synthesizing novel ideas through combining existing concepts--or sophisticated pattern matching of training data. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we investigate the combinational creativity of VLMs from the lens of concept blending. We propose the Identification-Explanation-Implication (IEI) framework, which decomposes creative processes into three levels: identifying input spaces, extracting shared attributes, and deriving novel semantic implications. To validate this framework, we curate CreativeMashup, a high-quality dataset of 666 artist-generated visual mashups annotated according to the IEI framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that in comprehension tasks, best VLMs have surpassed average human performance while falling short of expert-level understanding; in generation tasks, incorporating our IEI framework into the generation pipeline significantly enhances the creative quality of VLMs outputs. Our findings establish both a theoretical foundation for evaluating artificial creativity and practical guidelines for improving creative generation in VLMs.

  _Siwei Yang, Mude Hui, Bingchen Zhao, Yuyin Zhou, Nataniel Ruiz, Cihang Xie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce $\texttt{Complex-Edit}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate instruction-based image editing models across instructions of varying complexity. To develop this benchmark, we harness GPT-4o to automatically collect a diverse set of editing instructions at scale. Our approach follows a well-structured ``Chain-of-Edit'' pipeline: we first generate individual atomic editing tasks independently and then integrate them to form cohesive, complex instructions. Additionally, we introduce a suite of metrics to assess various aspects of editing performance, along with a VLM-based auto-evaluation pipeline that supports large-scale assessments. Our benchmark yields several notable insights: 1) Open-source models significantly underperform relative to proprietary, closed-source models, with the performance gap widening as instruction complexity increases; 2) Increased instructional complexity primarily impairs the models' ability to retain key elements from the input images and to preserve the overall aesthetic quality; 3) Decomposing a complex instruction into a sequence of atomic steps, executed in a step-by-step manner, substantially degrades performance across multiple metrics; 4) A straightforward Best-of-N selection strategy improves results for both direct editing and the step-by-step sequential approach; and 5) We observe a ``curse of synthetic data'': when synthetic data is involved in model training, the edited images from such models tend to appear increasingly synthetic as the complexity of the editing instructions rises -- a phenomenon that intriguingly also manifests in the latest GPT-4o outputs.

- **[Low-hallucination Synthetic Captions for Large-Scale Vision-Language Model Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13123)**  `arXiv:2504.13123`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Xinsong Zhang, Yarong Zeng, Xinting Huang, Hu Hu, Runquan Xie, Han Hu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, the field of vision-language model pre-training has experienced rapid advancements, driven primarily by the continuous enhancement of textual capabilities in large language models. However, existing training paradigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality image-text pairs. As models and data scales grow exponentially, the availability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce and saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain. This study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for vision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale low-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a viable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2) achieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language models through empirical validation. This paper presents three key contributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, low-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions. Our continuous DPO methodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations. Specifically, the non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2% to 77.9% for a 7B-size model. 2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals that our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their counterparts. Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data achieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text pairs and other previous work. Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support in the text-to-image domain. With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1 on a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation benchmark. 3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and knowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset.

  Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success across multiple disciplines due to their exceptional instruction-following capabilities and extensive world knowledge. However, whether these MLLMs possess human-like compositional reasoning abilities remains an open problem. To unveil their reasoning behaviors, we first curate a \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{A}ssumptive \textbf{R}ea\textbf{s}oning Benchmark (MARS-Bench) in this paper. Interestingly, we find that most prevalent MLLMs can be easily fooled by the introduction of a presupposition into the question, whereas such presuppositions appear naive to human reasoning. Besides, we also propose a simple yet effective method, Active Deduction (AD), a novel reinforcement learning paradigm to encourage the model to actively perform composite deduction before reaching a final decision. Equipped with the proposed AD method, a MLLM demonstrates significant improvements in assumptive reasoning abilities without compromising its general-purpose question-answering performance. We also provide extensive evaluations of both open-source and private MLLMs on MARS-Bench, along with experimental analyses of the AD method.

- **[EventVAD: Training-Free Event-Aware Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13092)**  `arXiv:2504.13092`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yihua Shao, Haojin He, Sijie Li, Siyu Chen, Xinwei Long, Fanhu Zeng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in video generation have been driven by diffusion models and autoregressive frameworks, yet critical challenges persist in harmonizing prompt adherence, visual quality, motion dynamics, and duration: compromises in motion dynamics to enhance temporal visual quality, constrained video duration (5-10 seconds) to prioritize resolution, and inadequate shot-aware generation stemming from general-purpose MLLMs' inability to interpret cinematic grammar, such as shot composition, actor expressions, and camera motions. These intertwined limitations hinder realistic long-form synthesis and professional film-style generation. To address these limitations, we propose SkyReels-V2, an Infinite-length Film Generative Model, that synergizes Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), Multi-stage Pretraining, Reinforcement Learning, and Diffusion Forcing Framework. Firstly, we design a comprehensive structural representation of video that combines the general descriptions by the Multi-modal LLM and the detailed shot language by sub-expert models. Aided with human annotation, we then train a unified Video Captioner, named SkyCaptioner-V1, to efficiently label the video data. Secondly, we establish progressive-resolution pretraining for the fundamental video generation, followed by a four-stage post-training enhancement: Initial concept-balanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) improves baseline quality; Motion-specific Reinforcement Learning (RL) training with human-annotated and synthetic distortion data addresses dynamic artifacts; Our diffusion forcing framework with non-decreasing noise schedules enables long-video synthesis in an efficient search space; Final high-quality SFT refines visual fidelity.

  Recent advances in the visual-language area have developed natural multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for spatial reasoning through visual prompting. However, due to remote sensing (RS) imagery containing abundant geospatial information that differs from natural images, it is challenging to effectively adapt natural spatial models to the RS domain. Moreover, current RS MLLMs are limited in overly narrow interpretation levels and interaction manner, hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address those challenges, a spatial MLLM named EarthGPT-X is proposed, enabling a comprehensive understanding of multi-source RS imagery, such as optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and infrared. EarthGPT-X offers zoom-in and zoom-out insight, and possesses flexible multi-grained interactive abilities. Moreover, EarthGPT-X unifies two types of critical spatial tasks (i.e., referring and grounding) into a visual prompting framework. To achieve these versatile capabilities, several key strategies are developed. The first is the multi-modal content integration method, which enhances the interplay between images, visual prompts, and text instructions. Subsequently, a cross-domain one-stage fusion training strategy is proposed, utilizing the large language model (LLM) as a unified interface for multi-source multi-task learning. Furthermore, by incorporating a pixel perception module, the referring and grounding tasks are seamlessly unified within a single framework. In addition, the experiments conducted demonstrate the superiority of the proposed EarthGPT-X in multi-grained tasks and its impressive flexibility in multi-modal interaction, revealing significant advancements of MLLM in the RS field.

  Collaborative perception has attracted growing interest from academia and industry due to its potential to enhance perception accuracy, safety, and robustness in autonomous driving through multi-agent information fusion. With the advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, numerous collaborative perception datasets have emerged, varying in cooperation paradigms, sensor configurations, data sources, and application scenarios. However, the absence of systematic summarization and comparative analysis hinders effective resource utilization and standardization of model evaluation. As the first comprehensive review focused on collaborative perception datasets, this work reviews and compares existing resources from a multi-dimensional perspective. We categorize datasets based on cooperation paradigms, examine their data sources and scenarios, and analyze sensor modalities and supported tasks. A detailed comparative analysis is conducted across multiple dimensions. We also outline key challenges and future directions, including dataset scalability, diversity, domain adaptation, standardization, privacy, and the integration of large language models. To support ongoing research, we provide a continuously updated online repository of collaborative perception datasets and related literature:this https URL.

  The widespread adoption of diffusion models in image generation has increased the demand for privacy-compliant unlearning. However, due to the high-dimensional nature and complex feature representations of diffusion models, achieving selective unlearning remains challenging, as existing methods struggle to remove sensitive information while preserving the consistency of non-sensitive regions. To address this, we propose an Automatic Dataset Creation Framework based on prompt-based layered editing and training-free local feature removal, constructing the ForgetMe dataset and introducing the Entangled evaluation metric. The Entangled metric quantifies unlearning effectiveness by assessing the similarity and consistency between the target and background regions and supports both paired (Entangled-D) and unpaired (Entangled-S) image data, enabling unsupervised evaluation. The ForgetMe dataset encompasses a diverse set of real and synthetic scenarios, including CUB-200-2011 (Birds), Stanford-Dogs, ImageNet, and a synthetic cat dataset. We apply LoRA fine-tuning on Stable Diffusion to achieve selective unlearning on this dataset and validate the effectiveness of both the ForgetMe dataset and the Entangled metric, establishing them as benchmarks for selective unlearning. Our work provides a scalable and adaptable solution for advancing privacy-preserving generative AI.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, they often struggle with capturing complex human preferences and generalizing to unseen data. To address these challenges, we introduce Energy-Based Reward Model (EBRM), a lightweight post-hoc refinement framework that enhances RM robustness and generalization. EBRM models the reward distribution explicitly, capturing uncertainty in human preferences and mitigating the impact of noisy or misaligned annotations. It achieves this through conflict-aware data filtering, label-noise-aware contrastive training, and hybrid initialization. Notably, EBRM enhances RMs without retraining, making it computationally efficient and adaptable across different models and tasks. Empirical evaluations on RM benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both robustness and generalization, achieving up to a 5.97% improvement in safety-critical alignment tasks compared to standard RMs. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments confirm that our refined rewards enhance alignment quality, effectively delaying reward hacking. These results demonstrate our approach as a scalable and effective enhancement for existing RMs and alignment pipelines. The code is available at EBRM.

  There is a long history of building predictive models in healthcare using tabular data from electronic medical records. However, these models fail to extract the information found in unstructured clinical notes, which document diagnosis, treatment, progress, medications, and care plans. In this study, we investigate how answers generated by GPT-4o-mini (ChatGPT) to simple clinical questions about patients, when given access to the patient's discharge summary, can support patient-level mortality prediction. Using data from 14,011 first-time admissions to the Coronary Care or Cardiovascular Intensive Care Units in the MIMIC-IV Note dataset, we implement a transparent framework that uses GPT responses as input features in logistic regression models. Our findings demonstrate that GPT-based models alone can outperform models trained on standard tabular data, and that combining both sources of information yields even greater predictive power, increasing AUC by an average of 5.1 percentage points and increasing positive predictive value by 29.9 percent for the highest-risk decile. These results highlight the value of integrating large language models (LLMs) into clinical prediction tasks and underscore the broader potential for using LLMs in any domain where unstructured text data remains an underutilized resource.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The KV-Cache technique has become the standard for the inference of large language models (LLMs). Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a bottleneck of the LLM inference system. This paper enables a novel dynamic KV-Cache eviction policy by injecting a lightweight module called Attention-Gate to the model. It accepts the global context as input and yields eviction flags for each token. The self-attention modules in the model proceed according to the flags and cache only a subset of the KV states for next token prediction. The Attention-Gates can yield various flags for different heads and layers and be easily tuned on top of a pre-trained LLM via continual pre-training or supervised fine-tuning. The computational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates can be minimal. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach across multiple scenarios, showing that effective eviction of redundant tokens can not only improve efficiency but also enhance performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies have made significant progress in developing large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain, which can answer expert-level questions and demonstrate the potential to assist clinicians in real-world clinical scenarios. Studies have also witnessed the importance of integrating various modalities with the existing LLMs for a better understanding of complex clinical contexts, which are innately multi-faceted by nature. Although studies have demonstrated the ability of multimodal LLMs in histopathology to answer questions from given images, they lack in understanding of thorough clinical context due to the patch-level data with limited information from public datasets. Thus, developing WSI-level MLLMs is significant in terms of the scalability and applicability of MLLMs in histopathology. In this study, we introduce an expert-level MLLM for histopathology using WSIs, dubbed as ChatEXAONEPath. We present a retrieval-based data generation pipeline using 10,094 pairs of WSIs and histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We also showcase an AI-based evaluation protocol for a comprehensive understanding of the medical context from given multimodal information and evaluate generated answers compared to the original histopathology reports. We demonstrate the ability of diagnosing the given histopathology images using ChatEXAONEPath with the acceptance rate of 62.9% from 1,134 pairs of WSIs and reports. Our proposed model can understand pan-cancer WSIs and clinical context from various cancer types. We argue that our proposed model has the potential to assist clinicians by comprehensively understanding complex morphology of WSIs for cancer diagnosis through the integration of multiple modalities.

  A wide range of LM applications require generating text that conforms to syntactic or semantic constraints. Imposing such constraints can be naturally framed as probabilistic conditioning, but exact generation from the resulting distribution -- which can differ substantially from the LM's base distribution -- is generally intractable. In this work, we develop an architecture for controlled LM generation based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Our SMC framework allows us to flexibly incorporate domain- and problem-specific constraints at inference time, and efficiently reallocate computational resources in light of new information during the course of generation. By comparing to a number of alternatives and ablations on four challenging domains -- Python code generation for data science, text-to-SQL, goal inference, and molecule synthesis -- we demonstrate that, with little overhead, our approach allows small open-source language models to outperform models over 8x larger, as well as closed-source, fine-tuned ones. In support of the probabilistic perspective, we show that these performance improvements are driven by better approximation to the posterior distribution. Our system builds on the framework of Lew et al. (2023) and integrates with its language model probabilistic programming language, giving users a simple, programmable way to apply SMC to a broad variety of controlled generation problems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the development of general-purpose autonomous agents, demonstrating remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks across various domains. This surge has spurred the evolution of a plethora of prompt-based reasoning frameworks. A recent focus has been on iterative reasoning strategies that refine outputs through self-evaluation and verbalized feedback. However, these strategies require additional computational complexity to enable models to recognize and correct their mistakes, leading to a significant increase in their cost. In this work, we introduce the concept of ``retrials without feedback'', an embarrassingly simple yet powerful mechanism for enhancing reasoning frameworks by allowing LLMs to retry problem-solving attempts upon identifying incorrect answers. Unlike conventional iterative refinement methods, our method does not require explicit self-reflection or verbalized feedback, simplifying the refinement process. Our findings indicate that simpler retrial-based approaches often outperform more sophisticated reasoning frameworks, suggesting that the benefits of complex methods may not always justify their computational costs. By challenging the prevailing assumption that more intricate reasoning strategies inherently lead to better performance, our work offers new insights into how simpler, more efficient approaches can achieve optimal results. So, are retrials all you need?

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) sometimes fail to respond appropriately to deterministic tasks -- such as counting or forming acronyms -- because the implicit prior distribution they have learned over sequences of tokens influences their responses. In this work, we show that, in at least some cases, LLMs actually compute the information needed to perform these tasks correctly, and we identify some interventions that can allow them to access this information to improve their performance. First, we show that simply prompting the language model to not rely on its prior knowledge leads to dramatic improvements in prior-dominated tasks. We then use mechanistic interpretability techniques to localize the prior within the LLM and manipulate the extent to which that prior influences its responses. Specifically, we show that it is possible to identify layers of the underlying neural network that correlate with the prior probability of a response and that lightweight finetuning of these layers with basic prompts on prior-dominated tasks achieves high performance on held-out answers. These results suggest that the information required to produce a correct response is contained within the representations of the problems formed by the models. Furthermore, we show that this finetuning is significantly more effective for prior-dominated tasks, and that the error after finetuning is no longer correlated with the prior. Our results suggest that it may be possible to define effective methods for manipulating the extent to which LLMs rely upon their priors in solving problems, potentially increasing their performance in settings where LLMs hallucinate for reasons related to the prior probability of token sequences.

  Recent smaller language models such Phi-3.5 and Phi-4 rely on synthetic data generated using larger Language models. Questions remain about leveraging synthetic data for other use cases, such as adapting LLMs to specific domains. A key limitation of synthetic data is low diversity, which negatively impacts its downstream applicability for improving other models. To address this, we propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple "expert" LLM agents to collaboratively generate data. Using only 25 million tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B-v0.3) to two specialized domains-Finance and Biomedicine-without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in general tasks. In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM pre-training corpora.Continually pre-training Mistral-7B-v0.3 with MetaSynth notably outperforms the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08% in Finance and 13.75% in Biomedicine. The same model shows degraded performance when trained on data generated using a template prompt, even when the template includes prior generations and varying In-Context exemplars of real data. Our findings suggest that a few million tokens of diverse synthetic data without mixing any real data, is sufficient for effective domain adaptation when using MetaSynth.

  To what extent can entire books be extracted from LLMs? Using the Llama 3 70B family of models, and the "prefix-prompting" extraction technique, we were able to auto-regressively reconstruct, with a very high level of similarity, one entire book (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) from just the first 500 tokens. We were also able to obtain high extraction rates on several other books, piece-wise. However, these successes do not extend uniformly to all books. We show that extraction rates of books correlate with book popularity and thus, likely duplication in the training data.We also confirm the undoing of mitigations in the instruction-tuned Llama 3.1, following recent work (Nasr et al., 2025). We further find that this undoing comes from changes to only a tiny fraction of weights concentrated primarily in the lower transformer blocks. Our results provide evidence of the limits of current regurgitation mitigation strategies and introduce a framework for studying how fine-tuning affects the retrieval of verbatim memorization in aligned LLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of pre-trained knowledge in their parameters, but updating them as real-world information evolves remains a challenge. Existing methodologies and benchmarks primarily target entity substitutions, failing to capture the full breadth of complex real-world dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge Update Playground (KUP), an automatic pipeline for simulating realistic knowledge updates reflected in an evidence corpora. KUP's evaluation framework includes direct and indirect probes to both test memorization of updated facts and reasoning over them, for any update learning methods. Next, we present a lightweight method called memory conditioned training (MCT), which conditions tokens in the update corpus on self-generated "memory" tokens during training. Our strategy encourages LLMs to surface and reason over newly memorized knowledge at inference. Our results on two strong LLMs show that (1) KUP benchmark is highly challenging, with the best CPT models achieving $<2\%$ in indirect probing setting (reasoning) and (2) MCT training significantly outperforms prior continued pre-training (CPT) baselines, improving direct probing (memorization) results by up to $25.4\%$.

  Clinical case reports and discharge summaries may be the most complete and accurate summarization of patient encounters, yet they are finalized, i.e., timestamped after the encounter. Complementary data structured streams become available sooner but suffer from incompleteness. To train models and algorithms on more complete and temporally fine-grained data, we construct a pipeline to phenotype, extract, and annotate time-localized findings within case reports using large language models. We apply our pipeline to generate an open-access textual time series corpus for Sepsis-3 comprising 2,139 case reports from the Pubmed-Open Access (PMOA) Subset. To validate our system, we apply it on PMOA and timeline annotations from I2B2/MIMIC-IV and compare the results to physician-expert annotations. We show high recovery rates of clinical findings (event match rates: O1-preview--0.755, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753) and strong temporal ordering (concordance: O1-preview--0.932, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.932). Our work characterizes the ability of LLMs to time-localize clinical findings in text, illustrating the limitations of LLM use for temporal reconstruction and providing several potential avenues of improvement via multimodal integration.

  While data synthesis and distillation are promising strategies to enhance small language models, current approaches heavily rely on Large Language Models (LLMs), which suffer from high computational costs, environmental inefficiency, and potential biases inherited from monolithic architectures. In contrast, smaller LLMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual capabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable data. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose a multiple small LLMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized roles across small LLMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically achieved by a single large LLM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small LLMs assume distinct roles-Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator-to simulate a peer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial data samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the Adjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. By decomposing the synthesis process into specialized sub-tasks, collaborative small LLMs can achieve data-level parity with large LLM-based distillation. Through experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that GRA-produced data matches or exceeds the quality of single large LLM outputs, e.g., Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct. Our results challenge the necessity of monolithic large models for high-quality data synthesis, advocating instead for strategic coordination of smaller agents.

  Recent evaluations of LLMs on coreference resolution have revealed that traditional output formats and evaluation metrics do not fully capture the models' referential understanding. To address this, we introduce IdentifyMe, a new benchmark for mention resolution presented in a multiple-choice question (MCQ) format, commonly used for evaluating LLMs. IdentifyMe features long narratives and employs heuristics to exclude easily identifiable mentions, creating a more challenging task. The benchmark also consists of a curated mixture of different mention types and corresponding entities, allowing for a fine-grained analysis of model performance. We evaluate both closed- and open source LLMs on IdentifyMe and observe a significant performance gap (20-30%) between the state-of-the-art sub-10B open models vs. closed ones. We observe that pronominal mentions, which have limited surface information, are typically much harder for models to resolve than nominal mentions. Additionally, we find that LLMs often confuse entities when their mentions overlap in nested structures. The highest-scoring model, GPT-4o, achieves 81.9% accuracy, highlighting the strong referential capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs while also indicating room for further improvement.

  With the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), numerous outstanding accomplishments have emerged within the open-source community. Due to the complexity of creating and training multimodal data pairs, it is still a computational and time-consuming process to build powerful MLLMs. In this work, we introduce Capybara-OMNI, an MLLM that trains in a lightweight and efficient manner and supports understanding text, image, video, and audio modalities. We present in detail the framework design, the data construction, and the training recipe, to develop an MLLM step-by-step to obtain competitive performance. We also provide exclusive benchmarks utilized in our experiments to show how to properly verify understanding capabilities across different modalities. Results show that by following our guidance, we can efficiently build an MLLM that achieves competitive performance among models of the same scale on various multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, to enhance the multimodal instruction following and conversational capabilities of the model, we further discuss how to train the chat version upon an MLLM understanding model, which is more in line with user habits for tasks like real-time interaction with humans. We publicly disclose the Capybara-OMNI model, along with its chat-based version. The disclosure includes both the model weights, a portion of the training data, and the inference codes, which are made available on GitHub.

  Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve the factuality of their responses. However, in practice, these systems often need to handle ambiguous user queries and potentially conflicting information from multiple sources while also suppressing inaccurate information from noisy or irrelevant documents. Prior work has generally studied and addressed these challenges in isolation, considering only one aspect at a time, such as handling ambiguity or robustness to noise and misinformation. We instead consider multiple factors simultaneously, proposing (i) RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguity and Misinformation in Documents), a new dataset that simulates complex and realistic scenarios for conflicting evidence for a user query, including ambiguity, misinformation, and noise; and (ii) MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent approach in which LLM agents debate over the merits of an answer over multiple rounds, allowing an aggregator to collate responses corresponding to disambiguated entities while discarding misinformation and noise, thereby handling diverse sources of conflict jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs -- which requires presenting all valid answers for ambiguous queries -- improving over strong RAG baselines by up to 11.40% and on FaithEval -- which requires suppressing misinformation -- where we improve by up to 15.80% (absolute) with Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, we find that RAMDocs poses a challenge for existing RAG baselines (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only obtains 32.60 exact match score). While MADAM-RAG begins to address these conflicting factors, our analysis indicates that a substantial gap remains especially when increasing the level of imbalance in supporting evidence and misinformation.

The analysis is further extended to four large language models (LLMs): GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen, and Claude. Our results reveal a counterintuitive trend: models with higher technical accuracy often exhibit lower agreement with domain experts, whereas LLMs demonstrate greater expert alignment despite relatively lower accuracy scores. To quantify and interpret model-expert agreement, we employ Cohen's Kappa, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and SHAP-based explainability techniques. Findings indicate that expert-aligned models tend to rely more on contextual and temporal language cues, rather than location-specific keywords. These results underscore that accuracy alone is insufficient for evaluating models in safety-critical NLP applications. We advocate for incorporating expert agreement as a complementary metric in model evaluation frameworks and highlight the promise of LLMs as interpretable, scalable tools for crash analysis pipelines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aspect-based summarization aims to generate summaries tailored to specific aspects, addressing the resource constraints and limited generalizability of traditional summarization approaches. Recently, large language models have shown promise in this task without the need for training. However, they rely excessively on prompt engineering and face token limits and hallucination challenges, especially with in-context learning. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for aspect-based summarization: Self-Aspect Retrieval Enhanced Summary Generation. Rather than relying solely on in-context learning, given an aspect, we employ an embedding-driven retrieval mechanism to identify its relevant text segments. This approach extracts the pertinent content while avoiding unnecessary details, thereby mitigating the challenge of token limits. Moreover, our framework optimizes token usage by deleting unrelated parts of the text and ensuring that the model generates output strictly based on the given aspect. With extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our framework not only achieves superior performance but also effectively mitigates the token limitation problem.

  Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive information during training, posing risks when deploying publicly accessible models. Current machine unlearning methods struggle to selectively remove specific data associations without degrading overall model capabilities. This paper presents our solution to SemEval-2025 Task 4 on targeted unlearning, which introduces a two-stage methodology that combines causal mediation analysis with layer-specific optimization. Through systematic causal tracing experiments on OLMo architectures (1B and 7B parameters), we identify the critical role of the first few transformer layers (layers 0-5) in storing subject-attribute associations within MLP modules. Building on this insight, we develop a constrained optimization approach that freezes upper layers while applying a novel joint loss function to lower layers-simultaneously maximizing forget set loss via output token cross-entropy penalties and minimizing retain set deviation through adaptive regularization. Our method achieves 2nd place in the 1B model track, demonstrating strong task performance while maintaining 88% of baseline MMLU accuracy. These results establish causal-informed layer optimization as a promising paradigm for efficient, precise unlearning in LLMs, offering a significant step forward in addressing data privacy concerns in AI systems.

  The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced information retrieval systems, particularly in response generation (RG). Unfortunately, LLMs often face knowledge conflicts between internal memory and retrievaled external information, arising from misinformation, biases, or outdated knowledge. These conflicts undermine response reliability and introduce uncertainty in decision-making. In this work, we analyze how LLMs navigate knowledge conflicts from an information-theoretic perspective and reveal that when conflicting and supplementary information exhibit significant differences, LLMs confidently resolve their preferences. However, when the distinction is ambiguous, LLMs experience heightened uncertainty. Based on this insight, we propose Swin-VIB, a novel framework that integrates a pipeline of variational information bottleneck models into adaptive augmentation of retrieved information and guiding LLM preference in response generation. Extensive experiments on single-choice, open-ended question-answering (QA), and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of Swin-VIB. Notably, our method improves single-choice task accuracy by at least 7.54\% over competitive baselines.

However, existing works primarily focus on ethical reviews, failing to capture the diversity of national values, which encompass broader policy, legal, and moral considerations. Furthermore, current benchmarks that rely on spectrum tests using manually designed questionnaires are not easily scalable.To address these limitations, we introduce NaVAB, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with the values of five major nations: China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. NaVAB implements a national value extraction pipeline to efficiently construct value assessment datasets. Specifically, we propose a modeling procedure with instruction tagging to process raw data sources, a screening process to filter value-related topics and a generation process with a Conflict Reduction mechanism to filter non-conflictingthis http URLconduct extensive experiments on various LLMs across countries, and the results provide insights into assisting in the identification of misaligned scenarios. Moreover, we demonstrate that NaVAB can be combined with alignment techniques to effectively reduce value concerns by aligning LLMs' values with the target country.

  Despite significant progress, recent studies indicate that current large language models (LLMs) may still capture dataset biases and utilize them during inference, leading to the poor generalizability of LLMs. However, due to the diversity of dataset biases and the insufficient nature of bias suppression based on in-context learning, the effectiveness of previous prior knowledge-based debiasing methods and in-context learning based automatic debiasing methods is limited. To address these challenges, we explore the combination of causal mechanisms with information theory and propose an information gain-guided causal intervention debiasing (IGCIDB) framework. This framework first utilizes an information gain-guided causal intervention method to automatically and autonomously balance the distribution of instruction-tuning dataset. Subsequently, it employs a standard supervised fine-tuning process to train LLMs on the debiased dataset. Experimental results show that IGCIDB can effectively debias LLM to improve its generalizability across different tasks.

  Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in general domains and demonstrated promise in multimodal mathematical reasoning. However, applying MLLMs to geometry problem solving (GPS) remains challenging due to lack of accurate step-by-step solution data and severe hallucinations during reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoGen, a pipeline that can automatically generates step-wise reasoning paths for geometry diagrams. By leveraging the precise symbolic reasoning, \textbf{GeoGen} produces large-scale, high-quality question-answer pairs. To further enhance the logical reasoning ability of MLLMs, we train \textbf{GeoLogic}, a Large Language Model (LLM) using synthetic data generated by GeoGen. Serving as a bridge between natural language and symbolic systems, GeoLogic enables symbolic tools to help verifying MLLM outputs, making the reasoning process more rigorous and alleviating hallucinations. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves the performance of MLLMs, achieving remarkable results on benchmarks for geometric reasoning tasks. This improvement stems from our integration of the strengths of LLMs and symbolic systems, which enables a more reliable and interpretable approach for the GPS task.

  Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language questions (NLQs) by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods either rely on employing task-specific strategies or custom-defined representations, which struggle to leverage the knowledge transfer between different SKR tasks or align with the prior of LLMs, thereby limiting their performance. This paper proposes a novel USKR framework named \textsc{Pandora}, which takes advantage of \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API to construct a unified knowledge representation for alignment with LLM pre-training. It employs an LLM to generate textual reasoning steps and executable Python code for each question. Demonstrations are drawn from a memory of training examples that cover various SKR tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks involving three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified frameworks and competes effectively with task-specific methods.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive datasets often learn sensitive information, which raises significant social and legal concerns under principles such as the "Right to be forgotten." Retraining entire models from scratch to remove undesired information is both costly and impractical. Furthermore, existing single-domain unlearning methods fail to address multi-domain scenarios, where knowledge is interwoven across domains such as privacy and copyright, creating overlapping representations that lead to excessive knowledge removal or degraded performance. To tackle these issues, we propose GRAIL (GRadient-based AdaptIve unLearning), a novel multi-domain unlearning framework. GRAIL leverages gradient information from multiple domains to precisely distinguish the unlearning scope from the retention scope, and applies an adaptive parameter-wise localization strategy to selectively remove targeted knowledge while preserving critical parameters for each domain. Experimental results on unlearning benchmarks show that GRAIL achieves unlearning success on par with the existing approaches, while also demonstrating up to 17% stronger knowledge retention success compared to the previous state-of-art method. Our findings establish a new paradigm for effectively managing and regulating sensitive information in large-scale pre-trained language models.

  Aligning language models with human preferences presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving personalization without incurring excessive computational costs. Existing methods rely on reward signals and additional annotated data, limiting their scalability and adaptability to diverse human values. To address these challenges, we introduce Persona-judge, a novel discriminative paradigm that enables training-free personalized alignment with unseen preferences. Instead of optimizing policy parameters through external reward feedback, Persona-judge leverages the intrinsic preference judgment capabilities of the model. Specifically, a draft model generates candidate tokens conditioned on a given preference, while a judge model, embodying another preference, cross-validates the predicted tokens whether to be accepted. Experimental results demonstrate that Persona-judge, using the inherent preference evaluation mechanisms of the model, offers a scalable and computationally efficient solution to personalized alignment, paving the way for more adaptive customized alignment.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with long-context reasoning, not only due to the quadratic scaling of computational complexity with sequence length but also because of the scarcity and expense of annotating long-context data. There has been barely any open-source work that systematically ablates long-context data, nor is there any openly available instruction tuning dataset with contexts surpassing 100K tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel post-training synthetic data generation strategy designed to efficiently extend the context window of LLMs while preserving their general task performance. Our approach scalably extends to arbitrarily long context lengths, unconstrained by the length of available real-world data, which effectively addresses the scarcity of raw long-context data. Through a step-by-step rotary position embedding (RoPE) scaling training strategy, we demonstrate that our model, with a context length of up to 1M tokens, performs well on the RULER benchmark and InfiniteBench and maintains robust performance on general language tasks.

  Recent work suggests that preference-tuning techniques--including Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences (RLHF) methods like PPO and GRPO, as well as alternatives like DPO--reduce diversity, creating a dilemma given that such models are widely deployed in applications requiring diverse outputs. To address this, we introduce a framework for measuring effective semantic diversity--diversity among outputs that meet quality thresholds--which better reflects the practical utility of large language models (LLMs). Using open-ended tasks that require no human intervention, we find counterintuitive results: although preference-tuned models--especially those trained via RL--exhibit reduced lexical and syntactic diversity, they produce greater effective semantic diversity than SFT or base models, not from increasing diversity among high-quality outputs, but from generating more high-quality outputs overall. We discover that preference tuning reduces syntactic diversity while preserving semantic diversity--revealing a distinction between diversity in form and diversity in content that traditional metrics often overlook. Our analysis further shows that smaller models are consistently more parameter-efficient at generating unique content within a fixed sampling budget, offering insights into the relationship between model scaling and diversity. These findings have important implications for applications that require diverse yet high-quality outputs, from creative assistance to synthetic data generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges in representation learning by requiring models to capture both the semantic richness of node-associated texts and the structural dependencies of the graph. While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions, text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.

  Pretraining data has a direct impact on the behaviors and quality of language models (LMs), but we only understand the most basic principles of this relationship. While most work focuses on pretraining data's effect on downstream task behavior, we investigate its relationship to LM representations. Previous work has discovered that, in language models, some concepts are encoded `linearly' in the representations, but what factors cause these representations to form? We study the connection between pretraining data frequency and models' linear representations of factual relations. We find evidence that the formation of linear representations is strongly connected to pretraining term frequencies; specifically for subject-relation-object fact triplets, both subject-object co-occurrence frequency and in-context learning accuracy for the relation are highly correlated with linear representations. This is the case across all phases of pretraining. In OLMo-7B and GPT-J, we discover that a linear representation consistently (but not exclusively) forms when the subjects and objects within a relation co-occur at least 1k and 2k times, respectively, regardless of when these occurrences happen during pretraining. Finally, we train a regression model on measurements of linear representation quality in fully-trained LMs that can predict how often a term was seen in pretraining. Our model achieves low error even on inputs from a different model with a different pretraining dataset, providing a new method for estimating properties of the otherwise-unknown training data of closed-data models. We conclude that the strength of linear representations in LMs contains signal about the models' pretraining corpora that may provide new avenues for controlling and improving model behavior: particularly, manipulating the models' training data to meet specific frequency thresholds.

  Timing of clinical events is central to characterization of patient trajectories, enabling analyses such as process tracing, forecasting, and causal reasoning. However, structured electronic health records capture few data elements critical to these tasks, while clinical reports lack temporal localization of events in structured form. We present a system that transforms case reports into textual time series-structured pairs of textual events and timestamps. We contrast manual and large language model (LLM) annotations (n=320 and n=390 respectively) of ten randomly-sampled PubMed open-access (PMOA) case reports (N=152,974) and assess inter-LLM agreement (n=3,103; N=93). We find that the LLM models have moderate event recall(O1-preview: 0.80) but high temporal concordance among identified events (O1-preview: 0.95). By establishing the task, annotation, and assessment systems, and by demonstrating high concordance, this work may serve as a benchmark for leveraging the PMOA corpus for temporal analytics.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are often provided as a service via an API, making it challenging for developers to detect changes in their behavior. We present an approach to monitor LLMs for changes by comparing the distributions of linguistic and psycholinguistic features of generated text. Our method uses a statistical test to determine whether the distributions of features from two samples of text are equivalent, allowing developers to identify when an LLM has changed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using five OpenAI completion models and Meta's Llama 3 70B chat model. Our results show that simple text features coupled with a statistical test can distinguish between language models. We also explore the use of our approach to detect prompt injection attacks. Our work enables frequent LLM change monitoring and avoids computationally expensive benchmark evaluations.

  Span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction represents a novel and complex challenge within emotion cause analysis. This task involves identifying emotion spans, cause spans, and their associated emotion categories within the text to form structured triplets. While prior research has predominantly concentrated on clause-level emotion-cause pair extraction and span-level emotion-cause detection, these methods often confront challenges originating from redundant information retrieval and difficulty in accurately determining emotion categories, particularly when emotions are expressed implicitly or ambiguously. To overcome these challenges, this study explores a fine-grained approach to span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction and introduces an innovative framework that leverages instruction tuning and data augmentation techniques based on large language models. The proposed method employs task-specific triplet extraction instructions and utilizes low-rank adaptation to fine-tune large language models, eliminating the necessity for intricate task-specific architectures. Furthermore, a prompt-based data augmentation strategy is developed to address data scarcity by guiding large language models in generating high-quality synthetic training data. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving at least a 12.8% improvement in span-level emotion-cause-category triplet extraction metrics. The results demonstrate the method's effectiveness and robustness, offering a promising avenue for advancing research in emotion cause analysis. The source code is available atthis https URL.

  While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge, conventional single-agent RAG remains fundamentally limited in resolving complex queries demanding coordinated reasoning across heterogeneous data ecosystems. We present HM-RAG, a novel Hierarchical Multi-agent Multimodal RAG framework that pioneers collaborative intelligence for dynamic knowledge synthesis across structured, unstructured, and graph-based data. The framework is composed of three-tiered architecture with specialized agents: a Decomposition Agent that dissects complex queries into contextually coherent sub-tasks via semantic-aware query rewriting and schema-guided context augmentation; Multi-source Retrieval Agents that carry out parallel, modality-specific retrieval using plug-and-play modules designed for vector, graph, and web-based databases; and a Decision Agent that uses consistency voting to integrate multi-source answers and resolve discrepancies in retrieval results through Expert Model Refinement. This architecture attains comprehensive query understanding by combining textual, graph-relational, and web-derived evidence, resulting in a remarkable 12.95% improvement in answer accuracy and a 3.56% boost in question classification accuracy over baseline RAG systems on the ScienceQA and CrisisMMD benchmarks. Notably, HM-RAG establishes state-of-the-art results in zero-shot settings on both datasets. Its modular architecture ensures seamless integration of new data modalities while maintaining strict data governance, marking a significant advancement in addressing the critical challenges of multimodal reasoning and knowledge synthesis in RAG systems.

  Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a fundamental task in both natural language processing and information retrieval. While NLI has developed many sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for CDCL-NLI that extends traditional NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 1,110 instances and spanning 26 languages. To build a baseline for this task, we also propose an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion and interpretability prediction. Our method employs RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) on RGAT (Relation-aware Graph Attention Network) for cross-document context modeling, coupled with a structure-aware semantic alignment mechanism based on lexical chains for cross-lingual understanding. For NLI interpretability, we develop an EDU-level attribution framework that generates extractive explanations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's superior performance, achieving significant improvements over both traditional NLI models such as DocNLI and R2F, as well as LLMs like Llama3 and GPT-4o. Our work sheds light on the study of NLI and will bring research interest on cross-document cross-lingual context understanding, semantic retrieval and interpretability inference.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant document from external knowledge sources. By referencing this external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the generation of factually incorrect content and addresses hallucination issues within LLMs. Recently, there has been growing attention to improving the performance and efficiency of RAG systems from various perspectives. While these advancements have yielded significant results, the application of RAG in domains with considerable societal implications raises a critical question about fairness: What impact does the introduction of the RAG paradigm have on the fairness of LLMs? To address this question, we conduct extensive experiments by varying the LLMs, retrievers, and retrieval sources. Our experimental analysis reveals that the scale of the LLMs plays a significant role in influencing fairness outcomes within the RAG framework. When the model scale is smaller than 8B, the integration of retrieval mechanisms often exacerbates unfairness in small-scale LLMs (e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, Mistral-7B, and LLaMA3-8B). To mitigate the fairness issues introduced by RAG for small-scale LLMs, we propose two approaches, FairFT and FairFilter. Specifically, in FairFT, we align the retriever with the LLM in terms of fairness, enabling it to retrieve documents that facilitate fairer model outputs. In FairFilter, we propose a fairness filtering mechanism to filter out biased content after retrieval. Finally, we validate our proposed approaches on real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving fairness while maintaining performance.

  In the past few years, Language Models (LMs) have shown par-human capabilities in several domains. Despite their practical applications and exceeding user consumption, they are susceptible to jailbreaks when malicious input exploits the LM's weaknesses, causing it to deviate from its intended behavior. Current defensive strategies either classify the input prompt as adversarial or prevent LMs from generating harmful outputs. However, it is challenging to explain the reason behind the malicious nature of the jailbreak, which results in a wide variety of closed-box approaches. In this research, we propose and demonstrate that system-prompt attention from Small Language Models (SLMs) can be used to characterize adversarial prompts, providing a novel, explainable, and cheaper defense approach called AttentionDefense. Our research suggests that the attention mechanism is an integral component in understanding and explaining how LMs respond to malicious input that is not captured in the semantic meaning of text embeddings. The proposed AttentionDefense is evaluated against existing jailbreak benchmark datasets. Ablation studies show that SLM-based AttentionDefense has equivalent or better jailbreak detection performance compared to text embedding-based classifiers and GPT-4 zero-shotthis http URLfurther validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, we generate a dataset of novel jailbreak variants of the existing benchmark dataset using a closed-loop LLM-based multi-agent system. We demonstrate that the proposed AttentionDefense approach performs robustly on this novel jailbreak dataset while existing approaches suffer in performance. Additionally, for practical purposes AttentionDefense is an ideal solution as it has the computation requirements of a small LM but the performance of a LLM detector.

  Large language models are increasingly used in scientific domains, especially for molecular understanding and analysis. However, existing models are affected by hallucination issues, resulting in errors in drug design and utilization. In this paper, we first analyze the sources of hallucination in LLMs for molecular comprehension tasks, specifically the knowledge shortcut phenomenon observed in the PubChem dataset. To evaluate hallucination in molecular comprehension tasks with computational efficiency, we introduce \textbf{Mol-Hallu}, a novel free-form evaluation metric that quantifies the degree of hallucination based on the scientific entailment relationship between generated text and actual molecular properties. Utilizing the Mol-Hallu metric, we reassess and analyze the extent of hallucination in various LLMs performing molecular comprehension tasks. Furthermore, the Hallucination Reduction Post-processing stage~(HRPP) is proposed to alleviate molecular hallucinations, Experiments show the effectiveness of HRPP on decoder-only and encoder-decoder molecular LLMs. Our findings provide critical insights into mitigating hallucination and improving the reliability of LLMs in scientific applications.

  Federated Learning (FL) faces major challenges regarding communication overhead and model privacy when training large language models (LLMs), especially in healthcare applications. To address these, we introduce Selective Attention Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel approach that dynamically fine-tunes only those transformer layers identified as attention-critical. By employing attention patterns to determine layer importance, SAFL significantly reduces communication bandwidth and enhances differential privacy resilience. Evaluations on clinical NLP benchmarks (i2b2 Clinical Concept Extraction and MIMIC-III discharge summaries) demonstrate that SAFL achieves competitive performance with centralized models while substantially improving communication efficiency and privacy preservation.

  While reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek R1) trained with reinforcement learning (RL), excel in textual reasoning, they struggle in scenarios requiring structured problem-solving, such as geometric reasoning, concise computation, or complex equation solving-areas where computational tools like code interpreters (CI) demonstrate distinct advantages. To bridge this gap, we propose ReTool, which enhances long-form reasoning with tool-integrated learning, including two key features: (1) dynamic interleaving of real-time code execution within natural language reasoning processes, and (2) an automated RL paradigm that allows policy rollouts with multi-turn real-time code execution and teaches the model in learning when and how to invoke tools based on outcome feedback. ReTool employs a systematic training framework, beginning with synthetic cold-start data generation to produce code-augmented long-form reasoning traces for fine-tuning base models. Subsequent RL training leverages task outcomes as rewards to iteratively refine the model's tool use strategy, enabling autonomous discovery of optimal tool invocation patterns without human priors. Experiments on the challenging MATH Olympiad benchmark AIME demonstrate ReTool's superiority: Our 32B model achieves 67% accuracy with 400 training steps, outperforming text-based RL baseline (40% accuracy, 1080 steps) in efficiency and performance. Remarkably, ReTool-32B attains 72.5% accuracy in extended settings, surpassing OpenAI's o1-preview by 27.9%. Further analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as code self-correction, signaling an ''aha moment'' in which the model autonomously masters adaptive tool use. These findings highlight the promise of outcome-driven tool integration for advancing complex mathematical reasoning and offer new insights into hybrid neuro-symbolic systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) perform well in medical QA, but their effectiveness in Japanese contexts is limited due to privacy constraints that prevent the use of commercial models like GPT-4 in clinical settings. As a result, recent efforts focus on instruction-tuning open-source LLMs, though the potential of combining them with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to explore a knowledge graph-based (KG) RAG framework for Japanese medical QA small-scale open-source LLMs. Experimental results show that KG-based RAG has only a limited impact on Japanese medical QA using small-scale open-source LLMs. Further case studies reveal that the effectiveness of the RAG is sensitive to the quality and relevance of the external retrieved content. These findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential of applying RAG in Japanese medical QA, while also serving as a reference for other low-resource languages.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for various tasks and applications. However, LLMs and fine-tuning are limited to the pre-trained data. For example, ChatGPT's world knowledge until 2021 can be outdated or inaccurate. To enhance the capabilities of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), is proposed to augment LLMs with additional, new, latest details and information to LLMs. While RAG offers the correct information, it may not best present it, especially to different population groups with personalizations. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) adapts to user needs by aligning model responses with human preference through feedback loops. In real-life applications, such as mental health problems, a dynamic and feedback-based model would continuously adapt to new information and offer personalized assistance due to complex factors fluctuating in a daily environment. Thus, we propose an Online Reinforcement Learning-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (OnRL-RAG) system to detect and personalize the responding systems to mental health problems, such as stress, anxiety, and depression. We use an open-source dataset collected from 2028 College Students with 28 survey questions for each student to demonstrate the performance of our proposed system with the existing systems. Our system achieves superior performance compared to standard RAG and simple LLM via GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-3.5. This work would open up the possibilities of real-life applications of LLMs for personalized services in the everyday environment. The results will also help researchers in the fields of sociology, psychology, and neuroscience to align their theories more closely with the actual human daily environment.

  Quantization has gained attention as a promising solution for the cost-effective deployment of large and small language models. However, most prior work has been limited to perplexity or basic knowledge tasks and lacks a comprehensive evaluation of recent models like Llama-3.3. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of instruction-tuned models spanning 1B to 405B parameters, applying four quantization methods across 13 datasets. Our findings reveal that (1) quantized models generally surpass smaller FP16 baselines, yet they often struggle with instruction-following and hallucination detection; (2) FP8 consistently emerges as the most robust option across tasks, and AWQ tends to outperform GPTQ in weight-only quantization; (3) smaller models can suffer severe accuracy drops at 4-bit quantization, while 70B-scale models maintain stable performance; (4) notably, \textit{hard} tasks do not always experience the largest accuracy losses, indicating that quantization magnifies a model's inherent weaknesses rather than simply correlating with task difficulty; and (5) an LLM-based judge (MT-Bench) highlights significant performance declines in coding and STEM tasks, though reasoning may sometimes improve.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit powerful general intelligence across diverse scenarios, including their integration into chatbots. However, a vital challenge of LLM-based chatbots is that they may produce hallucinated content in responses, which significantly limits their applicability. Various efforts have been made to alleviate hallucination, such as retrieval augmented generation and reinforcement learning with human feedback, but most of them require additional training and data annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel post-hoc Citation-Enhanced Generation (CEG) approach combined with retrieval argumentation. Unlike previous studies that focus on preventing hallucinations during generation, our method addresses this issue in a post-hoc way. It incorporates a retrieval module to search for supporting documents relevant to the generated content, and employs a natural language inference-based citation generation module. Once the statements in the generated content lack of reference, our model can regenerate responses until all statements are supported by citations. Note that our method is a training-free plug-and-play plugin that is capable of various LLMs. Experiments on various hallucination-related datasets show our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both hallucination detection and response regeneration on three benchmarks. Our codes and dataset will be publicly available.

  Generating novel and creative scientific hypotheses is a cornerstone in achieving Artificial General Intelligence. Large language and reasoning models have the potential to aid in the systematic creation, selection, and validation of scientifically informed hypotheses. However, current foundation models often struggle to produce scientific ideas that are both novel and feasible. One reason is the lack of a dedicated dataset that frames Scientific Hypothesis Generation (SHG) as a Natural Language Generation (NLG) task. In this paper, we introduce HypoGen, the first dataset of approximately 5500 structured problem-hypothesis pairs extracted from top-tier computer science conferences structured with a Bit-Flip-Spark schema, where the Bit is the conventional assumption, the Spark is the key insight or conceptual leap, and the Flip is the resulting counterproposal. HypoGen uniquely integrates an explicit Chain-of-Reasoning component that reflects the intellectual process from Bit to Flip. We demonstrate that framing hypothesis generation as conditional language modelling, with the model fine-tuned on Bit-Flip-Spark and the Chain-of-Reasoning (and where, at inference, we only provide the Bit), leads to improvements in the overall quality of the hypotheses. Our evaluation employs automated metrics and LLM judge rankings for overall quality assessment. We show that by fine-tuning on our HypoGen dataset we improve the novelty, feasibility, and overall quality of the generated hypotheses. The HypoGen dataset is publicly available atthis http URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in long-context reasoning abilities of language models led to interesting applications in large-scale multi-document summarization. However, prior work has shown that these long-context models are not effective at their claimed context windows. To this end, retrieval-augmented systems provide an efficient and effective alternative. However, their performance can be highly sensitive to the choice of retrieval context length. In this work, we present a hybrid method that combines retrieval-augmented systems with long-context windows supported by recent language models. Our method first estimates the optimal retrieval length as a function of the retriever, summarizer, and dataset. On a randomly sampled subset of the dataset, we use a panel of LLMs to generate a pool of silver references. We use these silver references to estimate the optimal context length for a given RAG system configuration. Our results on the multi-document summarization task showcase the effectiveness of our method across model classes and sizes. We compare against length estimates from strong long-context benchmarks such as RULER and HELMET. Our analysis also highlights the effectiveness of our estimation method for very long-context LMs and its generalization to new classes of LMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Instruction tuning has enabled large language models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable performance, but its success heavily depends on the availability of large-scale, high-quality instruction-response pairs. However, current methods for scaling up data generation often overlook a crucial aspect: the alignment between instructions and responses. We hypothesize that high-quality instruction-response pairs are not defined by the individual quality of each component, but by the extent of their alignment with each other. To address this, we propose a Mutual Alignment Framework (MAIN) that ensures coherence between the instruction and response through mutual constraints. Experiments demonstrate that models such as LLaMA and Mistral, fine-tuned within this framework, outperform traditional methods across multiple benchmarks. This approach underscores the critical role of instruction-response alignment in enabling scalable and high-quality instruction tuning for LLMs.

  _Amey Hengle, Prasoon Bajpai, Soham Dan, Tanmoy Chakraborty_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing multilingual long-context benchmarks, often based on the popular needle-in-a-haystack test, primarily evaluate a model's ability to locate specific information buried within irrelevant texts. However, such a retrieval-centric approach is myopic and inherently limited, as successful recall alone does not indicate a model's capacity to reason over extended contexts. Moreover, these benchmarks are susceptible to data leakage, short-circuiting, and risk making the evaluation a priori identifiable. To address these limitations, we introduce MLRBench, a new synthetic benchmark for multilingual long-context reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks, MLRBench goes beyond surface-level retrieval by including tasks that assess multi-hop inference, aggregation, and epistemic reasoning. Spanning seven languages, MLRBench is designed to be parallel, resistant to leakage, and scalable to arbitrary context lengths. Our extensive experiments with an open-weight large language model (LLM) reveal a pronounced gap between high- and low-resource languages, particularly for tasks requiring the model to aggregate multiple facts or predict the absence of information. We also find that, in multilingual settings, LLMs effectively utilize less than 30% of their claimed context length. Although off-the-shelf Retrieval Augmented Generation helps alleviate this to a certain extent, it does not solve the long-context problem. We open-source MLRBench to enable future research in improved evaluation and training of multilingual LLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations-content that deviates from factual accuracy or provided context-posing challenges for diagnosis due to the complex interplay of underlying causes. This paper introduces a subsequence association framework to systematically trace and understand hallucinations. Our key insight is that hallucinations arise when dominant hallucinatory associations outweigh faithful ones. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we demonstrate that decoder-only transformers effectively function as subsequence embedding models, with linear layers encoding input-output associations. We propose a tracing algorithm that identifies causal subsequences by analyzing hallucination probabilities across randomized input contexts. Experiments show our method outperforms standard attribution techniques in identifying hallucination causes and aligns with evidence from the model's training corpus. This work provides a unified perspective on hallucinations and a robust framework for their tracing and analysis.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in code generation tasks. However, there remains a performance gap between open-source and closed-source models. To address this gap, existing approaches typically generate large amounts of synthetic data for fine-tuning, which often leads to inefficient training. In this work, we propose a data selection strategy in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of training for code-based LLMs. By prioritizing data complexity and ensuring that the sampled subset aligns with the distribution of the original dataset, our sampling strategy effectively selects high-quality data. Additionally, we optimize the tokenization process through a "dynamic pack" technique, which minimizes padding tokens and reduces computational resource consumption. Experimental results show that when training on 40% of the OSS-Instruct dataset, the DeepSeek-Coder-Base-6.7B model achieves an average performance of 66.9%, surpassing the 66.1% performance with the full dataset. Moreover, training time is reduced from 47 minutes to 34 minutes, and the peak GPU memory decreases from 61.47 GB to 42.72 GB during a single epoch. Similar improvements are observed with the CodeLlama-Python-7B model on the Evol-Instruct dataset. By optimizing both data selection and tokenization, our approach not only improves model performance but also improves training efficiency.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) not only have solved complex reasoning problems but also exhibit remarkable performance in tasks that require subjective decision making. Existing studies suggest that LLM generations can be subjectively grounded to some extent, yet exploring whether LLMs can account for individual-level subjectivity has not been sufficiently studied. In this paper, we characterize subjectivity of individuals on social media and infer their moral judgments using LLMs. We propose a framework, SOLAR (Subjective Ground with Value Abstraction), that observes value conflicts and trade-offs in the user-generated texts to better represent subjective ground of individuals. Empirical results show that our framework improves overall inference results as well as performance on controversial situations. Additionally, we qualitatively show that SOLAR provides explanations about individuals' value preferences, which can further account for their judgments.

  Geometry problem-solving (GPS), a challenging task requiring both visual comprehension and symbolic reasoning, effectively measures the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Humans exhibit strong reasoning ability in this task through accurate identification and adaptive application of geometric principles within visual contexts. However, existing benchmarks fail to jointly assess both dimensions of the human-like geometric reasoning mechanism in MLLMs, remaining a critical gap in assessing their ability to tackle GPS. To this end, we introduce GeoSense, the first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the geometric reasoning abilities of MLLMs through the lens of geometric principles. GeoSense features a five-level hierarchical framework of geometric principles spanning plane and solid geometry, an intricately annotated dataset of 1,789 problems, and an innovative evaluation strategy. Through extensive experiments on GeoSense with various open-source and closed-source MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.0-pro-flash performs best, achieving an overall score of $65.3$. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the identification and application of geometric principles remain a bottleneck for leading MLLMs, jointly hindering their reasoning abilities. These findings underscore GeoSense's potential to guide future advancements in MLLMs' geometric reasoning capabilities, paving the way for more robust and human-like reasoning in artificial intelligence.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks by incorporating external knowledge retrieval. However, existing RAG frameworks primarily rely on semantic similarity and correlation-driven retrieval, limiting their ability to distinguish true causal relationships from spurious associations. This results in responses that may be factually grounded but fail to establish cause-and-effect mechanisms, leading to incomplete or misleading insights. To address this issue, we introduce Causal Dynamic Feedback for Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CDF-RAG), a framework designed to improve causal consistency, factual accuracy, and explainability in generative reasoning. CDF-RAG iteratively refines queries, retrieves structured causal graphs, and enables multi-hop causal reasoning across interconnected knowledge sources. Additionally, it validates responses against causal pathways, ensuring logically coherent and factually grounded outputs. We evaluate CDF-RAG on four diverse datasets, demonstrating its ability to improve response accuracy and causal correctness over existing RAG-based methods.

  This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for aligning Persian Large Language Models (LLMs) with critical ethical dimensions, including safety, fairness, and social norms. It addresses the gaps in existing LLM evaluation frameworks by adapting them to Persian linguistic and cultural contexts. This benchmark creates three types of Persian-language benchmarks: (i) translated data, (ii) new data generated synthetically, and (iii) new naturally collected data. We translate Anthropic Red Teaming data, AdvBench, HarmBench, and DecodingTrust into Persian. Furthermore, we create ProhibiBench-fa, SafeBench-fa, FairBench-fa, and SocialBench-fa as new datasets to address harmful and prohibited content in indigenous culture. Moreover, we collect extensive dataset as GuardBench-fa to consider Persian cultural norms. By combining these datasets, our work establishes a unified framework for evaluating Persian LLMs, offering a new approach to culturally grounded alignment evaluation. A systematic evaluation of Persian LLMs is performed across the three alignment aspects: safety (avoiding harmful content), fairness (mitigating biases), and social norms (adhering to culturally accepted behaviors). We present a publicly available leaderboard that benchmarks Persian LLMs with respect to safety, fairness, and social norms at:this https URL.

  While metrics available during pre-training, such as perplexity, correlate well with model performance at scaling-laws studies, their predictive capacities at a fixed model size remain unclear, hindering effective model selection and development. To address this gap, we formulate the task of selecting pre-training checkpoints to maximize downstream fine-tuning performance as a pairwise classification problem: predicting which of two LLMs, differing in their pre-training, will perform better after supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We construct a dataset using 50 1B parameter LLM variants with systematically varied pre-training configurations, e.g., objectives or data, and evaluate them on diverse downstream tasks after SFT. We first conduct a study and demonstrate that the conventional perplexity is a misleading indicator. As such, we introduce novel unsupervised and supervised proxy metrics derived from pre-training that successfully reduce the relative performance prediction error rate by over 50%. Despite the inherent complexity of this task, we demonstrate the practical utility of our proposed proxies in specific scenarios, paving the way for more efficient design of pre-training schemes optimized for various downstream tasks.

  In our paper we explore the definition, and extrapolation of fallacies as they pertain to the automatic detection of manipulation on social media. In particular we explore how these logical fallacies might appear in the real world i.e internet forums. We discovered a prevalence of misinformation / misguided intention in discussion boards specifically centered around the Ukrainian Russian Conflict which serves to narrow the domain of our task. Although automatic fallacy detection has gained attention recently, most datasets use unregulated fallacy taxonomies or are limited to formal linguistic domains like political debates or news reports. Online discourse, however, often features non-standardized and diverse language not captured in these domains. We present Shady Linguistic Utterance Replication-Generation (SLURG) to address these limitations, exploring the feasibility of generating synthetic fallacious forum-style comments using large language models (LLMs), specifically DeepHermes-3-Mistral-24B. Our findings indicate that LLMs can replicate the syntactic patterns of real data} and that high-quality few-shot prompts enhance LLMs' ability to mimic the vocabulary diversity of online forums.

  Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across myriad language tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries implant hidden triggers that systematically manipulate model outputs. Traditional defenses focus on explicit token-level anomalies and therefore overlook semantic backdoors-covert triggers embedded at the conceptual level (e.g., ideological stances or cultural references) that rely on meaning-based cues rather than lexical oddities. We first show, in a controlled finetuning setting, that such semantic backdoors can be implanted with only a small poisoned corpus, establishing their practical feasibility. We then formalize the notion of semantic backdoors in LLMs and introduce a black-box detection framework, RAVEN (short for "Response Anomaly Vigilance for uncovering semantic backdoors"), which combines semantic entropy with cross-model consistency analysis. The framework probes multiple models with structured topic-perspective prompts, clusters the sampled responses via bidirectional entailment, and flags anomalously uniform outputs; cross-model comparison isolates model-specific anomalies from corpus-wide biases. Empirical evaluations across diverse LLM families (GPT-4o, Llama, DeepSeek, Mistral) uncover previously undetected semantic backdoors, providing the first proof-of-concept evidence of these hidden vulnerabilities and underscoring the urgent need for concept-level auditing of deployed language models.

  Recently, the application of the retrieval-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) in specific domains has gained significant attention, especially in biopharmaceuticals. However, in this context, there is no benchmark specifically designed for biopharmaceuticals to evaluate LLMs. In this paper, we introduce the Biopharmaceuticals Retrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation (BRAGE) , the first benchmark tailored for evaluating LLMs' Query and Reference Understanding Capability (QRUC) in the biopharmaceutical domain, available in English, French, German and Chinese. In addition, Traditional Question-Answering (QA) metrics like accuracy and exact match fall short in the open-ended retrieval-augmented QA scenarios. To address this, we propose a citation-based classification method to evaluate the QRUC of LLMs to understand the relationship between queries and references. We apply this method to evaluate the mainstream LLMs on BRAGE. Experimental results show that there is a significant gap in the biopharmaceutical QRUC of mainstream LLMs, and their QRUC needs to be improved.

  Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in specialized biomedical tasks due to the inherent complexity of medical reasoning and the sensitive nature of clinical data. Existing LLMs often struggle with intricate medical terminology and the need for accurate clinical insights, leading to performance reduction when quantized for resource-constrained deployment. To address these issues, we propose Quantized Medical Tree of Thought (QM-ToT), a path-based reasoning framework. QM-ToT leverages a Tree of Thought (ToT) reasoning approach to decompose complex medical problems into manageable subtasks, coupled with evaluator assessment layers. This framework facilitates substantial performance improvements in INT4-quantized models on the challenging MedQAUSMLE dataset. Specifically, we demonstrate a remarkable accuracy increase from 34% to 50% for the LLaMA2-70b model and from 58.77% to 69.49% for LLaMA-3.1-8b. Besides, we also proposed an effect data distillation method based on ToT. Compared to the traditional distillation method, we achieved an improvement of 86. 27% while using only 3.9% of thethis http URLwork, for the first time, showcases the potential of ToT to significantly enhance performance on complex biomedical tasks, establishing a crucial foundation for future advances in deploying high-performing quantized LLM in resource-limited medical settings.

  _Dingkang Lin, Naixuan Zhao, Dan Tian, Jiang Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advent of ChatGPT has profoundly reshaped scientific research practices, particularly in academic writing, where non-native English-speakers (NNES) historically face linguistic barriers. This study investigates whether ChatGPT mitigates these barriers and fosters equity by analyzing lexical complexity shifts across 2.8 million articles from OpenAlex (2020-2024). Using the Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD) to quantify vocabulary sophistication and a difference-in-differences (DID) design to identify causal effects, we demonstrate that ChatGPT significantly enhances lexical complexity in NNES-authored abstracts, even after controlling for article-level controls, authorship patterns, and venue norms. Notably, the impact is most pronounced in preprint papers, technology- and biology-related fields and lower-tier journals. These findings provide causal evidence that ChatGPT reduces linguistic disparities and promotes equity in global academia.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) engage users in multi-turn interactions to deliver personalized recommendations. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) further enhances these systems by enabling more natural and dynamic user interactions. However, a key challenge remains in understanding how personality traits shape conversational recommendation outcomes. Psychological evidence highlights the influence of personality traits on user interaction behaviors. To address this, we introduce an LLM-based personality-aware user simulation for CRSs (PerCRS). The user agent induces customizable personality traits and preferences, while the system agent possesses the persuasion capability to simulate realistic interaction in CRSs. We incorporate multi-aspect evaluation to ensure robustness and conduct extensive analysis from both user and system perspectives. Experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs can effectively generate diverse user responses aligned with specified personality traits, thereby prompting CRSs to dynamically adjust their recommendation strategies. Our experimental analysis offers empirical insights into the impact of personality traits on the outcomes of conversational recommender systems.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in language understanding and reasoning. Evaluating and analyzing their logical reasoning abilities has therefore become essential. However, existing datasets and benchmarks are often limited to overly simplistic, unnatural, or contextually constrained examples. In response to the growing demand, we introduce SmartyPat-Bench, a challenging, naturally expressed, and systematically labeled benchmark derived from real-world high-quality Reddit posts containing subtle logical fallacies. Unlike existing datasets and benchmarks, it provides more detailed annotations of logical fallacies and features more diverse data. To further scale up the study and address the limitations of manual data collection and labeling - such as fallacy-type imbalance and labor-intensive annotation - we introduce SmartyPat, an automated framework powered by logic programming-based oracles. SmartyPat utilizes Prolog rules to systematically generate logically fallacious statements, which are then refined into fluent natural-language sentences by LLMs, ensuring precise fallacy representation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartyPat produces fallacies comparable in subtlety and quality to human-generated content and significantly outperforms baseline methods. Finally, experiments reveal nuanced insights into LLM capabilities, highlighting that while excessive reasoning steps hinder fallacy detection accuracy, structured reasoning enhances fallacy categorization performance.

  Generative agents have been increasingly used to simulate human behaviour in silico, driven by large language models (LLMs). These simulacra serve as sandboxes for studying human behaviour without compromising privacy or safety. However, it remains unclear whether such agents can truly represent real individuals. This work compares survey data from the Understanding America Study (UAS) on healthcare decision-making with simulated responses from generative agents. Using demographic-based prompt engineering, we create digital twins of survey respondents and analyse how well different LLMs reproduce real-world behaviours. Our findings show that some LLMs fail to reflect realistic decision-making, such as predicting universal vaccine acceptance. However, Llama 3 captures variations across race and Income more accurately but also introduces biases not present in the UAS data. This study highlights the potential of generative agents for behavioural research while underscoring the risks of bias from both LLMs and prompting strategies.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Heterogeneous model fusion enhances the performance of LLMs by integrating the knowledge and capabilities of multiple structurally diverse models. However, existing approaches often rely solely on selecting the best output for each prompt from source models, which underutilizes their full potential due to limited source knowledge and results in sparse optimization signals. To address this limitation, we propose FuseRL, a novel two-stage framework comprising FuseSFT and FusePO to maximize the utilization of source LLMs. FuseSFT establishes a robust initialization by integrating the strengths of heterogeneous source models through weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on diverse outputs for each prompt. FusePO optimizes weighted preferences based on the outputs of multiple source models to enable superior alignment performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework across various preference alignment methods, including RLOO, DPO, and SimPO. Using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as the target model, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among 8B LLMs on the AlpacaEval-2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks. Further analysis suggests that FuseSFT regularizes the training process to reduce overfitting, while FusePO introduces dense and diverse signals for preference optimization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this era of rapid technological advancements, communication continues to evolve as new linguistic phenomena emerge. Among these is Arabizi, a hybrid form of Arabic that incorporates Latin characters and numbers to represent the spoken dialects of Arab communities. Arabizi is widely used on social media and allows people to communicate in an informal and dynamic way, but it poses significant challenges for machine translation due to its lack of formal structure and deeply embedded cultural nuances. This case study arises from a growing need to translate Arabizi for gisting purposes. It evaluates the capacity of different LLMs to decode and translate Arabizi, focusing on multiple Arabic dialects that have rarely been studied up until now. Using a combination of human evaluators and automatic metrics, this research project investigates the model's performance in translating Arabizi into both Modern Standard Arabic and English. Key questions explored include which dialects are translated most effectively and whether translations into English surpass those into Arabic.

  This study investigates the internal reasoning process of language models during arithmetic multi-step reasoning, motivated by the question of when they internally form their answers during reasoning. Particularly, we inspect whether the answer is determined before or after chain-of-thought (CoT) begins to determine whether models follow a post-hoc Think-to-Talk mode or a step-by-step Talk-to-Think mode of explanation. Through causal probing experiments in controlled arithmetic reasoning tasks, we found systematic internal reasoning patterns across models in our case study; for example, single-step subproblems are solved before CoT begins, and more complicated multi-step calculations are performed during CoT.

  While current large language models (LLMs) perform well on many knowledge-related tasks, they are limited by relying on their parameters as an implicit storage mechanism. As a result, they struggle with memorizing rare events and with updating their memory as facts change over time. In addition, the uninterpretable nature of parametric memory makes it challenging to prevent hallucination. Model editing and augmenting LLMs with parameters specialized for memory are only partial solutions. In this paper, we introduce MemLLM, a novel method of enhancing LLMs by integrating a structured and explicit read-and-write memory module. MemLLM tackles the aforementioned challenges by enabling dynamic interaction with the memory and improving the LLM's capabilities in using stored knowledge. Our experiments indicate that MemLLM enhances the LLM's performance and interpretability, in language modeling in general and knowledge-intensive tasks in particular. We see MemLLM as an important step towards making LLMs more grounded and factual through memory augmentation. The project repository is publicly available atthis https URL

  Large Language Models (LLMs) possess outstanding capabilities in addressing various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the sheer size of these models poses challenges in terms of storage, training and inference due to the inclusion of billions of parameters through layer stacking. While traditional approaches such as model pruning or distillation offer ways for reducing model size, they often come at the expense of performance retention. In our investigation, we systematically explore the approach of reducing the number of layers in LLMs. Surprisingly, we observe that even with fewer layers, LLMs maintain similar or better performance levels, particularly in prompt-based fine-tuning for text classification tasks. Remarkably, in certain cases, models with a single layer outperform their fully layered counterparts. These findings offer valuable insights for future work aimed at mitigating the size constraints of LLMs while preserving their performance, thereby opening avenues for significantly more efficient use of LLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on a variety of natural language tasks based on just a few examples of natural language instructions, reducing the need for extensive feature engineering. However, most powerful LLMs are closed-source or limited in their capability for languages other than English. In this technical report, we present Baichuan 2, a series of large-scale multilingual language models containing 7 billion and 13 billion parameters, trained from scratch, on 2.6 trillion tokens. Baichuan 2 matches or outperforms other open-source models of similar size on public benchmarks like MMLU, CMMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval. Furthermore, Baichuan 2 excels in vertical domains such as medicine and law. We will release all pre-training model checkpoints to benefit the research community in better understanding the training dynamics of Baichuan 2.

  As scientific research becomes increasingly complex, innovative tools are needed to manage vast data, facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration, and accelerate discovery. Large language models (LLMs) are now evolving into LLM-based scientific agents that automate critical tasks, ranging from hypothesis generation and experiment design to data analysis and simulation. Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these specialized agents integrate domain-specific knowledge, advanced tool sets, and robust validation mechanisms, enabling them to handle complex data types, ensure reproducibility, and drive scientific breakthroughs. This survey provides a focused review of the architectures, design, benchmarks, applications, and ethical considerations surrounding LLM-based scientific agents. We highlight why they differ from general agents and the ways in which they advance research across various scientific fields. By examining their development and challenges, this survey offers a comprehensive roadmap for researchers and practitioners to harness these agents for more efficient, reliable, and ethically sound scientific discovery.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with web search capabilities have demonstrated impressive potential for deep research tasks. However, current approaches predominantly rely on either manually engineered prompts (prompt engineering-based) with brittle performance or reinforcement learning within controlled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) environments (RAG-based) that fail to capture the complexities of real-world interaction. In this paper, we introduce DeepResearcher, the first comprehensive framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based deep research agents through scaling reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world environments with authentic web search interactions. Unlike RAG-based approaches that assume all necessary information exists within a fixed corpus, our method trains agents to navigate the noisy, unstructured, and dynamic nature of the open web. We implement a specialized multi-agent architecture where browsing agents extract relevant information from various webpage structures and overcoming significant technical challenges. Extensive experiments on open-domain research tasks demonstrate that DeepResearcher achieves substantial improvements of up to 28.9 points over prompt engineering-based baselines and up to 7.2 points over RAG-based RL agents. Our qualitative analysis reveals emergent cognitive behaviors from end-to-end RL training, including the ability to formulate plans, cross-validate information from multiple sources, engage in self-reflection to redirect research, and maintain honesty when unable to find definitive answers. Our results highlight that end-to-end training in real-world web environments is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental requirement for developing robust research capabilities aligned with real-world applications.

  Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key ingredient for enabling large language models (LLMs) to solve difficult problems, but comes with high latency and inference cost. We introduce sleep-time compute, which allows models to "think" offline about contexts before queries are presented: by anticipating what queries users might ask and pre-computing useful quantities, we can significantly reduce the compute requirements at test-time. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we create modified versions of two reasoning tasks - Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME. We find that sleep-time compute can reduce the amount of test-time compute needed to achieve the same accuracy by ~ 5x on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME and that by scaling sleep-time compute we can further increase accuracy by up to 13% on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and 18% on Stateful AIME. Furthermore, we introduce Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, which extends GSM-Symbolic by including multiple related queries per context. By amortizing sleep-time compute across related queries about the same context using Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, we can decrease the average cost per query by 2.5x. We then conduct additional analysis to understand when sleep-time compute is most effective, finding the predictability of the user query to be well correlated with the efficacy of sleep-time compute. Finally, we conduct a case-study of applying sleep-time compute to a realistic agentic SWE task.

  Most recent web agent research has focused on navigation and transaction tasks, with little emphasis on extracting structured data at scale. We present WebLists, a benchmark of 200 data-extraction tasks across four common business and enterprise use-cases. Each task requires an agent to navigate to a webpage, configure it appropriately, and extract complete datasets with well-defined schemas. We show that both LLMs with search capabilities and SOTA web agents struggle with these tasks, with a recall of 3% and 31%, respectively, despite higher performance on question-answering tasks.To address this challenge, we propose BardeenAgent, a novel framework that enables web agents to convert their execution into repeatable programs, and replay them at scale across pages with similar structure. BardeenAgent is also the first LLM agent to take advantage of the regular structure of HTML. In particular BardeenAgent constructs a generalizable CSS selector to capture all relevant items on the page, then fits the operations to extract the data.On the WebLists benchmark, BardeenAgent achieves 66% recall overall, more than doubling the performance of SOTA web agents, and reducing cost per output row by 3x.

  Evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has traditionally relied on static benchmark datasets, human assessments, or model-based evaluations - methods that often suffer from overfitting, high costs, and biases. ZeroSumEval is a novel competition-based evaluation protocol that leverages zero-sum games to assess LLMs with dynamic benchmarks that resist saturation. ZeroSumEval encompasses a diverse suite of games, including security challenges (PyJail), classic games (Chess, Liar's Dice, Poker), knowledge tests (MathQuiz), and persuasion challenges (Gandalf, Debate). These games are designed to evaluate a range of AI capabilities such as strategic reasoning, planning, knowledge application, and creativity. Building upon recent studies that highlight the effectiveness of game-based evaluations for LLMs, ZeroSumEval enhances these approaches by providing a standardized and extensible framework. To demonstrate this, we conduct extensive experiments with >7000 simulations across 7 games and 13 models. Our results show that while frontier models from the GPT and Claude families can play common games and answer questions, they struggle to play games that require creating novel and challenging questions. We also observe that models cannot reliably jailbreak each other and fail generally at tasks requiring creativity. We release our code atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tremendous potential as agents, excelling at tasks that require multiple rounds of reasoning and interactions. Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as an effective method for finetuning LLMs as agents: it first imitates expert-generated successful trajectories and further improves agentic skills through iterative fine-tuning on successful, self-generated trajectories. However, since the expert (e.g., GPT-4) succeeds primarily on simpler subtasks and RFT inherently favors simpler scenarios, many complex subtasks remain unsolved and persistently out-of-distribution (OOD). Upon investigating these challenging subtasks, we discovered that previously failed expert trajectories can often provide valuable guidance, e.g., plans and key actions, that can significantly improve agent exploration efficiency and acquisition of critical skills. Motivated by these observations, we propose Exploring Expert Failures (EEF), which identifies beneficial actions from failed expert trajectories and integrates them into the training dataset. Potentially harmful actions are meticulously excluded to prevent contamination of the model learning process. By leveraging the beneficial actions in expert failures, EEF successfully solves some previously unsolvable subtasks and improves agent tuning performance. Remarkably, our approach achieved a 62\% win rate in WebShop, outperforming RFT (53. 6\%) and GPT-4 (35. 6\%), and to the best of our knowledge, setting a new state-of-the-art as the first method to surpass a score of 0.81 in WebShop and exceed 81 in SciWorld.

  We introduce REAL, a benchmark and framework for multi-turn agent evaluations on deterministic simulations of real-world websites. REAL comprises high-fidelity, deterministic replicas of 11 widely-used websites across domains such as e-commerce, travel, communication, and professional networking. We also release a benchmark consisting of 112 practical tasks that mirror everyday complex user interactions requiring both accurate information retrieval and state-changing actions. All interactions occur within this fully controlled setting, eliminating safety risks and enabling robust, reproducible evaluation of agent capability and reliability. Our novel evaluation framework combines programmatic checks of website state for action-based tasks with rubric-guided LLM-based judgments for information retrieval. The framework supports both open-source and proprietary agent systems through a flexible evaluation harness that accommodates black-box commands within browser environments, allowing research labs to test agentic systems without modification. Our empirical results show that frontier language models achieve at most a 41% success rate on REAL, highlighting critical gaps in autonomous web navigation and task completion capabilities. Our framework supports easy integration of new tasks, reproducible evaluation, and scalable post-training data generation, marking a significant step forward in evaluating and advancing agent capabilities.

  _Andrew Kiruluta, Andreas Lemos, Priscilla Burity_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel reinforcement learning framework for post training large language models that does not rely on human in the loop feedback. Instead, our approach uses cross attention signals within the model itself to derive a self supervised reward, thereby guiding iterative fine tuning of the model policy. By analyzing how the model attends to the input prompt during generation, we construct measures of prompt coverage, focus, and coherence. We then use these measures to rank or score candidate responses, providing a reward signal that encourages the model to produce well aligned, on topic text. In empirical comparisons against standard policy gradient methods and RL fine tuning with synthetic preference models, our method shows significant gains in prompt relevance and consistency over a non RL baseline. While it does not yet match the performance of fully human supervised RLHF systems, it highlights an important direction for scaling alignment with minimal human labeling. We provide a detailed analysis, discuss potential limitations, and outline future work for combining cross-attention based signals with smaller amounts of human feedback.
