  Despite their recent introduction to human society, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly affected the way we tackle mental challenges in our everyday lives. From optimizing our linguistic communication to assisting us in making important decisions, LLMs, such as ChatGPT, are notably reducing our cognitive load by gradually taking on an increasing share of our mental activities. In the context of Learning by Demonstration (LbD), classifying and segmenting complex motions into primitive actions, such as pushing, pulling, twisting etc, is considered to be a key-step towards encoding a task. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs to undertake this task, considering a finite set of predefined primitive actions found in fruit picking operations. By utilizing LLMs instead of simple supervised learning or analytic methods, we aim at making the method easily applicable and deployable in a real-life scenario. Three different fine-tuning approaches are investigated, compared on datasets captured kinesthetically, using a UR10e robot, during a fruit-picking scenario.

  Simulating collective decision-making involves more than aggregating individual behaviors; it emerges from dynamic interactions among individuals. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential for social simulation, achieving quantitative alignment with real-world data remains a key challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose the Mean-Field LLM (MF-LLM) framework, the first to incorporate mean field theory into LLM-based social simulation. MF-LLM models bidirectional interactions between individuals and the population through an iterative process, generating population signals to guide individual decisions, which in turn update the signals. This interplay produces coherent trajectories of collective behavior. To improve alignment with real-world data, we introduce IB-Tune, a novel fine-tuning method inspired by the Information Bottleneck principle, which retains population signals most predictive of future actions while filtering redundant history. Evaluated on a real-world social dataset, MF-LLM reduces KL divergence to human population distributions by 47\% compared to non-mean-field baselines, enabling accurate trend forecasting and effective intervention planning. Generalizing across 7 domains and 4 LLM backbones, MF-LLM provides a scalable, high-fidelity foundation for social simulation.

- **[Bradley-Terry and Multi-Objective Reward Modeling Are Complementary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07375)**  `arXiv:2507.07375`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring performance of reward models.

- **[Growing Transformers: Modular Composition and Layer-wise Expansion on a Frozen Substrate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07129)**  `arXiv:2507.07129`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and progressive layer-wise growth.First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g., Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to facilitate further research.

  Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training. Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance across 11 recognition datasets.

- **[From Images to Signals: Are Large Vision Models Useful for Time Series Analysis?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24030)**  `arXiv:2505.24030`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  Transformer-based models have gained increasing attention in time series research, driving interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) and foundation models for time series analysis. As the field moves toward multi-modality, Large Vision Models (LVMs) are emerging as a promising direction. In the past, the effectiveness of Transformer and LLMs in time series has been debated. When it comes to LVMs, a similar question arises: are LVMs truely useful for time series analysis? To address it, we design and conduct the first principled study involving 4 LVMs, 8 imaging methods, 18 datasets and 26 baselines across both high-level (classification) and low-level (forecasting) tasks, with extensive ablation analysis. Our findings indicate LVMs are indeed useful for time series classification but face challenges in forecasting. Although effective, the contemporary best LVM forecasters are limited to specific types of LVMs and imaging methods, exhibit a bias toward forecasting periods, and have limited ability to utilize long look-back windows. We hope our findings could serve as a cornerstone for future research on LVM- and multimodal-based solutions to different time series tasks.

  Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs, indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

- **[Squeeze the Soaked Sponge: Efficient Off-policy Reinforcement Finetuning for Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06892)**  `arXiv:2507.06892`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time, posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2) KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with 0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.

  Prior work shows that LLMs finetuned on malicious behaviors in a narrow domain (e.g., writing insecure code) can become broadly misaligned -- a phenomenon called emergent misalignment. We investigate whether this extends from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive ("I'll trick the user..."), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations ("Taking five sleeping pills at once is safe..."). Due to these rationalizations, monitors that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment.We examine sleeper agent reasoning models, extending our setup. These models perform bad behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes misalignment that remains hidden during evaluation, which brings additional risk. We find that sleeper agents can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers, demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these behaviors but is unreliable. In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied.We release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation suite.

- **[Agentic Retrieval of Topics and Insights from Earnings Calls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07906)**  `arXiv:2507.07906`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tracking the strategic focus of companies through topics in their earnings calls is a key task in financial analysis. However, as industries evolve, traditional topic modeling techniques struggle to dynamically capture emerging topics and their relationships. In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven approach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings calls. We propose an LLM-agent to extract topics from documents, structure them into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.

- **[Optimas: Optimizing Compound AI Systems with Globally Aligned Local Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03041)**  `arXiv:2507.03041`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Shirley Wu, Parth Sarthi, Shiyu Zhao, Aaron Lee, Herumb Shandilya, Adrian Mladenic Grobelnik, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Compound AI systems integrating multiple components, such as Large Language Models, specialized tools, and traditional machine learning models, are increasingly deployed to solve complex real-world tasks. However, optimizing compound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures and diverse configuration types across components, including prompts, hyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems. The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for improving compound systems.

- **[Skip a Layer or Loop it? Test-Time Depth Adaptation of Pretrained LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07996)**  `arXiv:2507.07996`  `cs.LG`  
  _Ziyue Li, Yang Li, Tianyi Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa, suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes (CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its potential to improve generalization in DRL.

- **[Frontier LLMs Still Struggle with Simple Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07313)**  `arXiv:2507.07313`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities-achieving remarkable performance on challenging competitive math and coding benchmarks-they also frequently fail on tasks that are easy for humans. This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a broad set of such "easy" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the literature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks, including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with changeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a math problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required to produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While previous work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail on such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models consistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical shortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long contexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the unpuzzles dataset, a different "easy" benchmark consisting of trivialized versions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs excel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized versions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing the originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able to solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our results highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic for frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even for simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply improved performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue. Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue, making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are identified.In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation metrics.

- **[CCQ: Convolutional Code for Extreme Low-bit Quantization in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07145)**  `arXiv:2507.07145`  `cs.LG`  
  _Zhaojing Zhou, Xunchao Li, Minghao Li, Handi Zhang, Haoshuang Wang, Wenbin Chang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4 bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions. Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to 184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE 4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B model and inference engine have been open-sourced.

  The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2, which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites.

- **[Harmonic Loss Trains Interpretable AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01628)**  `arXiv:2502.01628`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce harmonic loss as an alternative supervisory signal for training neural networks and large language models (LLMs). Harmonic loss differs from standard cross-entropy loss by (a) replacing the usual SoftMax normalization with a scale-invariant HarMax function and (b) computing logits via Euclidean distance rather than a dot product. Harmonic loss enables improved interpretability and faster convergence, owing to its scale invariance and finite convergence point by design, which can be interpreted as a class center. We first validate the performance of harmonic models across algorithmic, vision, and language datasets. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that models trained with harmonic loss perform better than standard models by: (a) enhancing interpretability, (b) requiring less data for generalization, and (c) reducing grokking. Moreover, we compare a GPT-2 model trained with harmonic loss to the standard GPT-2, illustrating that the harmonic model develops more interpretable representations. Looking forward, we believe harmonic loss may become a valuable tool in domains with limited data availability or in high-stakes applications where interpretability and reliability are paramount, paving the way for more robust and efficient neural network models.

  The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world. Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research. Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite. S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic planning. The code and datasets can be found inthis https URL.

- **[Rationale-Enhanced Decoding for Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07685)**  `arXiv:2507.07685`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding (RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded multi-modal systems.

  We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).

  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias, Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source (GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

  Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

  Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a 2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same video. The project page is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment (motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder, allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our proposed model.

  Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) demands robust integration of text detection, recognition, and spatial reasoning to interpret complex document layouts. In this work, we introduce DLaVA, a novel, training-free pipeline that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for zero-shot answer localization in order to improve trustworthiness, interpretability, and explainability. By leveraging an innovative OCR-free approach that organizes text regions with unique bounding box IDs, the proposed method preserves spatial contexts without relying on iterative OCR or chain-of-thought reasoning, thus substantially reducing the computational complexity. We further enhance the evaluation protocol by integrating Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics alongside Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS), thereby ensuring that not only textual accuracy is considered, but spatial accuracy is taken into account, ultimately reducing the risks of AI hallucinations and improving trustworthiness. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques, with significantly lower computational complexity and enhanced accuracies and reliability for high-stakes applications.

  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and benchmark are available. Our project page is:this https URL

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans, for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

  Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress, enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

  Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and understanding. However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work, we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector (GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical reasoning and science problem-solving.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they lag significantly behind humans in spatial reasoning. We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual Reasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object transformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1 rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios. Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning. Our work provides critical insights in advancing the research of MLLMs and reasoning models. The codes, model weights, and data will be publicly available atthis https URL.

  This paper introduces MedTrinity-25M, a comprehensive, large-scale multimodal dataset for medicine, covering over 25 million images across 10 modalities with multigranular annotations for more than 65 diseases. These multigranular annotations encompass both global information, such as modality and organ detection, and local information like ROI analysis, lesion texture, and region-wise correlations. Unlike the existing multimodal datasets, which are limited by the availability of image-text pairs, we have developed the first automated pipeline that scales up multimodal data by generating multigranular visual and textual annotations in the form of image-ROI-description triplets without the need for any paired text descriptions. Specifically, data from over 30 different sources have been collected, preprocessed, and grounded using domain-specific expert models to identify ROIs related to abnormal regions. We then build a comprehensive knowledge base and prompt multimodal large language models to perform retrieval-augmented generation with the identified ROIs as guidance, resulting in multigranular textual descriptions. Compared to existing datasets, MedTrinity-25M provides the most enriched annotations, supporting a comprehensive range of multimodal tasks such as captioning and report generation, as well as vision-centric tasks like classification and segmentation. We propose LLaVA-Tri by pretraining LLaVA on MedTrinity-25M, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA, surpassing representative SOTA multimodal large language models. Furthermore, MedTrinity-25M can also be utilized to support large-scale pre-training of multimodal medical AI models, contributing to the development of future foundation models in the medical domain. We will make our dataset available.

  Segmentation refinement aims to enhance the initial coarse masks generated by segmentation algorithms. The refined masks are expected to capture more details and better contours of the target objects. Research on segmentation refinement has developed as a response to the need for high-quality image segmentations. However, to our knowledge, no method has been developed that can determine the success of segmentation refinement. Such a method could ensure the reliability of segmentation in applications where the outcome of the segmentation is important and fosters innovation in image processing technologies. To address this research gap, we propose Judging From Support-set (JFS), a method to judge the success of segmentation refinement leveraging an off-the-shelf few-shot segmentation (FSS) model. The traditional goal of the problem in FSS is to find a target object in a query image utilizing target information given by a support set. However, we propose a novel application of the FSS model in our evaluation pipeline for segmentation refinement methods. Given a coarse mask as input, segmentation refinement methods produce a refined mask; these two masks become new support masks for the FSS model. The existing support mask then serves as the test set for the FSS model to evaluate the quality of the refined segmentation by the segmentation refinement methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed JFS framework by evaluating the SAM Enhanced Pseudo-Labels (SEPL) using SegGPT as the choice of FSS model on the PASCAL dataset. The results showed that JFS has the potential to determine whether the segmentation refinement process is successful.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering (QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5 families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%. Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD, combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems suitable for resource-constrained applications.

  Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases, resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17 benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Jailbreaking techniques trick Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing restricted output, posing a potential threat. One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the unsafe prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.

  We introduce Skywork-R1V3, an advanced, open-source vision-language model (VLM) that pioneers a new approach to visual reasoning. Its key innovation lies in effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language Models (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily stems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively activates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for additional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover the fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal alignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique indicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens, which has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training. Skywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving from 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities. Remarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B parameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation successfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related reasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and reinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on multimodal reasoning. Skywork-R1V3 represents a significant leap in multimodal reasoning, showcasing RL as a powerful engine for advancing open-source VLM capabilities.

  The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models: Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12 support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv datasets.

  We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite using a model of comparable size. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit: empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms, particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans. Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$ cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

  The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result, small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in complex reasoning tasks through the use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, allowing models to break down problems into manageable sub-tasks. However, existing CoT evaluation techniques either require annotated CoT data or fall short in accurately assessing intermediate reasoning steps, leading to high rates of false positives. In this paper, we formalize CoT reasoning in LLMs through an information-theoretic lens. Specifically, our framework quantifies the `information-gain' at each reasoning step, enabling the identification of failure modes in LLMs without the need for expensive annotated datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through extensive experiments on toy arithmetic, GSM8K and PRM800k datasets, where it significantly outperforms existing outcome-based methods by providing more accurate insights into model performance on individual subtasks.

  LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive, multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks. Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini. These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual reasoning.

  Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention, existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract, and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist, reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%. Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering (QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process, likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG, providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in knowledge-intensive AI applications.

  This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval, prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal artificial intelligence.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference alignment for LLMs. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data, significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile (Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers. In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability, requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested in this study.

  This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset, likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

  With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore, there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

  Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii) fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$ performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

  Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health (SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%), GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

  Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples). Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

  Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers, which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency, the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models. Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive performance.

  As language agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, they struggle with effective error correction and experience reuse across domains. We introduce Agent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic problem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses a core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's experiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution logs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent knowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success rates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3 improves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on intermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to improve from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a modular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from past experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.

  Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and o1 have demonstrated strong performance on clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks across multiple medical benchmarks. Nonetheless, two high-impact NLP tasks - structured tabular reporting from nurse dictations and medical order extraction from doctor-patient consultations - remain underexplored due to data scarcity and sensitivity, despite active industry efforts. Practical solutions to these real-world clinical tasks can significantly reduce the documentation burden on healthcare providers, allowing greater focus on patient care. In this paper, we investigate these two challenging tasks using private and open-source clinical datasets, evaluating the performance of both open- and closed-weight LLMs, and analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose an agentic pipeline for generating realistic, non-sensitive nurse dictations, enabling structured extraction of clinical observations. To support further research in both areas, we release SYNUR and SIMORD, the first open-source datasets for nurse observation extraction and medical order extraction.

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external information into the response generation process. However, how context-faithful LLMs are and what factors influence LLMs' context faithfulness remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the impact of memory strength and evidence presentation on LLMs' receptiveness to external evidence. We quantify the memory strength of LLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of the same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate evidence in various styles to examine LLMs' behavior. Our results show that for questions with high memory strength, LLMs are more likely to rely on internal memory. Furthermore, presenting paraphrased evidence significantly increases LLMs' receptiveness compared to simple repetition or adding details. These findings provide key insights for improving retrieval-augmented generation and context-aware LLMs. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in autonomous decision-making, where they sample options from vast action spaces. However, the heuristics that guide this sampling process remain under explored. We study this sampling behavior and show that this underlying heuristics resembles that of human decision-making: comprising a descriptive component (reflecting statistical norm) and a prescriptive component (implicit ideal encoded in the LLM) of a concept. We show that this deviation of a sample from the statistical norm towards a prescriptive component consistently appears in concepts across diverse real-world domains like public health, and economic trends. To further illustrate the theory, we demonstrate that concept prototypes in LLMs are affected by prescriptive norms, similar to the concept of normality in humans. Through case studies and comparison with human studies, we illustrate that in real-world applications, the shift of samples toward an ideal value in LLMs' outputs can result in significantly biased decision-making, raising ethical concerns.

  As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential. However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall, MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical practice.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files. Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time, minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

  Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning, prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX), DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations -- paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual and resource-constrained settings.

  This paper investigates the relationship between large language models' (LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized, existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring, phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness: the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration, focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model, RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%, on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%.

  Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND) framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20% improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

  Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality and obtains human preference.

  As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance, their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient, clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in medical domains.

  We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

  Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method (SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability, aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc) of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78% higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis and adaptive benchmark integration.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a high-quality dataset construction method for complex contract information extraction tasks in industrial scenarios and fine-tunes a large language model based on this dataset. Firstly, cluster analysis is performed on industrial contract texts, and GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 are used to extract key information from the original contract data, obtaining high-quality data annotations. Secondly, data augmentation is achieved by constructing new texts, and GPT-3.5 generates unstructured contract texts from randomly combined keywords, improving model robustness. Finally, the large language model is fine-tuned based on the high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that the model achieves excellent overall performance while ensuring high field recall and precision and considering parsing efficiency. LoRA, data balancing, and data augmentation effectively enhance model accuracy and robustness. The proposed method provides a novel and efficient solution for industrial contract information extraction tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps. While CoT improves both interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning limits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning, highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations. Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the frontier of LLM cognition.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Processing long contexts has become a critical capability for modern large language models (LLMs). Existing works leverage agent-based divide-and-conquer methods for processing long contexts. But these methods face crucial limitations, including prohibitive accumulated latency and amplified information loss from excessive agent invocations, and the disruption of inherent textual dependencies by immoderate partitioning. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent framework XpandA (Expand-Agent) coupled with question-driven workflow and dynamic partitioning for robust long-context processing. XpandA overcomes these limitations through: 1) dynamic partitioning of long texts, which adaptively modulates the filling rate of context windows for input sequences of vastly varying lengths; 2) question-guided protocol to update flat information ensembles within centralized shared memory, constructing consistent inter-agent knowledge across partitions; and 3) selectively replaying specific partitions based on the state-tracking of question-information couples to promote the resolution of inverted-order structures across partitions (e.g., flashbacks). We perform a comprehensive evaluation of XpandA on multiple long-context benchmarks with length varying from 1k to 1M, demonstrating XpandA's feasibility for processing ultra-long sequences and its significant effectiveness in enhancing the long-context capabilities of various LLMs by achieving 20\% improvements and 1.5x inference speedup over baselines of full-context, RAG and previous agent-based methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to generate explanations that are understood by explainees is the quintessence of explainable artificial intelligence. Since understanding depends on the explainee's background and needs, recent research focused on co-constructive explanation dialogues, where an explainer continuously monitors the explainee's understanding and adapts their explanations dynamically. We investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage as explainers in co-constructive explanation dialogues. In particular, we present a user study in which explainees interact with an LLM in two settings, one of which involves the LLM being instructed to explain a topic co-constructively. We evaluate the explainees' understanding before and after the dialogue, as well as their perception of the LLMs' co-constructive behavior. Our results suggest that LLMs show some co-constructive behaviors, such as asking verification questions, that foster the explainees' engagement and can improve understanding of a topic. However, their ability to effectively monitor the current understanding and scaffold the explanations accordingly remains limited.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The purpose of this paper is to examine whether large language models (LLMs) can understand what is good and evil with respect to judging good/evil reputation of celebrities. Specifically, we first apply a large language model (namely, ChatGPT) to the task of collecting sentences that mention the target celebrity from articles about celebrities on Web pages. Next, the collected sentences are categorized based on their contents by ChatGPT, where ChatGPT assigns a category name to each of those categories. Those assigned category names are referred to as "aspects" of each celebrity. Then, by applying the framework of retrieval augmented generation (RAG), we show that the large language model is quite effective in the task of judging good/evil reputation of aspects and descriptions of each celebrity. Finally, also in terms of proving the advantages of the proposed method over existing services incorporating RAG functions, we show that the proposed method of judging good/evil of aspects/descriptions of each celebrity significantly outperform an existing service incorporating RAG functions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In LLM evaluations, reasoning is often distinguished from recall/memorization by performing numerical variations to math-oriented questions. Here we introduce a general variation method for multiple-choice questions that completely dissociates the correct answer from previously seen tokens or concepts, requiring LLMs to understand and reason (rather than memorizing) in order to answer correctly. Using this method, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs on two datasets available in English and Spanish: the public MMLU benchmark and the private UNED-Access 2024 dataset. Results show that all models experience remarkable accuracy drops under our proposed variation, with an average loss of 57% on MMLU and 50% on UNED-Access 2024, ranging from 10% to 93% across models. Notably, the most accurate model in our experimentation (OpenAI-o3-mini) is not the most robust (DeepSeek-R1-70B), suggesting that the best models in standard evaluations may not be the ones with better reasoning capabilities. Also, we see larger accuracy drops in public (vs private) datasets and questions posed in their original language (vs a manual translation), which are signs of contamination and also point to a relevant role of recall/memorization in current LLMs' answers.

  Multiword expressions (MWEs) refer to idiomatic sequences of multiple words. MWE identification, i.e., detecting MWEs in text, can play a key role in downstream tasks such as machine translation, but existing datasets for the task are inconsistently annotated, limited to a single type of MWE, or limited in size. To enable reliable and comprehensive evaluation, we created CoAM: Corpus of All-Type Multiword Expressions, a dataset of 1.3K sentences constructed through a multi-step process to enhance data quality consisting of human annotation, human review, and automated consistency checking. Additionally, for the first time in a dataset of MWE identification, CoAM's MWEs are tagged with MWE types, such as Noun and Verb, enabling fine-grained error analysis. Annotations for CoAM were collected using a new interface created with our interface generator, which allows easy and flexible annotation of MWEs in any form. Through experiments using CoAM, we find that a fine-tuned large language model outperforms MWEasWSD, which achieved the state-of-the-art performance on the DiMSUM dataset. Furthermore, analysis using our MWE type tagged data reveals that Verb MWEs are easier than Noun MWEs to identify across approaches.

  Current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit limited ability to understand table structures and to apply precise numerical reasoning, which is crucial for tasks such as table question answering (TQA) and table-based fact verification (TFV). To address these challenges, we introduce our Tool-Augmented Reasoning framework for Tables (TART), which integrates LLMs with specialized tools. TART contains three key components: a table formatter to ensure accurate data representation, a tool maker to develop specific computational tools, and an explanation generator to maintain explainability. We also present the TOOLTAB dataset, a new benchmark designed specifically for training LLMs in table-tool integration. Our experiments indicate that TART achieves substantial improvements over existing methods (e.g., Chain-of-Thought) by improving both the precision of data processing and the clarity of the reasoning process. Notably, TART paired with CodeLlama achieves 90.0% of the accuracy of the closed-sourced LLM GPT-3.5-turbo, highlighting its robustness in diverse real-world scenarios.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities, yet existing prompting methods face a critical trade-off: simple approaches often struggle with complex tasks and reasoning stability, while more sophisticated methods require multiple inferences and substantial computational resources, limiting their practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose Derailer-Rerailer, a novel framework that adaptively balances reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency. At its core, our framework employs a lightweight Derailer mechanism to assess reasoning stability and selectively triggers an advanced Rerailer verification process only when necessary, thereby optimizing computational resource usage. Extensive evaluation across both open and closed-source models on more than 20 categories of mathematical, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning tasks demonstrates our framework's effectiveness: Derailer-Rerailer achieves significant accuracy improvements (8-11\% across various reasoning tasks) while maintaining 2-3 times better efficiency than existing verification methods, with particularly strong performance in mathematical and symbolic reasoning, offering a practical solution for enhancing LLM reasoning reliability while significantly reducing computational overhead.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming a wide range of domains, yet verifying their outputs remains a significant challenge, especially for complex open-ended tasks such as consolidation, summarization, and knowledge extraction. To address this, we introduce CheckEmbed (CE): a simple, scalable, and accurate verification method. CE reduces each LLM answer to a single embedding vector using powerful modern embedding LLM models like SFR-Embedding-Mistral. Prior methods such as BERTScore and SelfCheckGPT relied on weaker encoders like BERT, forcing them to operate at token or sentence granularity. In contrast, CE performs fast, semantically rich comparisons directly at the whole-answer level, overcoming key limitations in both accuracy and scalability. We conduct a comprehensive design and time complexity analysis across 13 verification baselines, including classical text scorers (e.g., BLEU), stability-based methods (e.g., SelfCheckGPT), and generative evaluators (e.g., LLM-as-a-Judge), which highlights the effectiveness, efficiency, versatility, and simplicity of CE. Empirical results show that CE reliably detects hallucinations in both closed and open-ended tasks. We further present evidence that CE generalizes beyond text to other modalities such as vision, establishing it as a practical and versatile verification framework.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent work has demonstrated that the latent spaces of large language models (LLMs) contain directions predictive of the truth of sentences. Multiple methods recover such directions and build probes that are described as uncovering a model's "knowledge" or "beliefs". We investigate this phenomenon, looking closely at the impact of context on the probes. Our experiments establish where in the LLM the probe's predictions are (most) sensitive to the presence of related sentences, and how to best characterize this kind of sensitivity. We do so by measuring different types of consistency errors that occur after probing an LLM whose inputs consist of hypotheses preceded by (negated) supporting and contradicting sentences. We also perform a causal intervention experiment, investigating whether moving the representation of a premise along these truth-value directions influences the position of an entailed or contradicted sentence along that same direction. We find that the probes we test are generally context sensitive, but that contexts which should not affect the truth often still impact the probe outputs. Our experiments show that the type of errors depend on the layer, the model, and the kind of data. Finally, our results suggest that truth-value directions are causal mediators in the inference process that incorporates in-context information.

  With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years, abundant new opportunities are emerging, but also new challenges, among which contamination is quickly becoming critical. Business applications and fundraising in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have reached a scale at which a few percentage points gained on popular question-answering benchmarks could translate into dozens of millions of dollars, placing high pressure on model integrity. At the same time, it is becoming harder and harder to keep track of the data that LLMs have seen; if not impossible with closed-source models like GPT-4 and Claude-3 not divulging any information on the training set. As a result, contamination becomes a major issue: LLMs' performance may not be reliable anymore, as the high performance may be at least partly due to their previous exposure to the data. This limitation jeopardizes real capability improvement in the field of NLP, yet, there remains a lack of methods on how to efficiently detect contamination. In this paper, we survey all recent work on contamination detection with LLMs, analyzing their methodologies and use cases to shed light on the appropriate usage of contamination detection methods. Our work calls the NLP research community's attention into systematically taking into account contamination bias in LLM evaluation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dehumanization, i.e., denying human qualities to individuals or groups, is a particularly harmful form of hate speech that can normalize violence against marginalized communities. Despite advances in NLP for detecting general hate speech, approaches to identifying dehumanizing language remain limited due to scarce annotated data and the subtle nature of such expressions. In this work, we systematically evaluate four state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) - Claude, GPT, Mistral, and Qwen - for dehumanization detection. Our results show that only one model-Claude-achieves strong performance (over 80% F1) under an optimized configuration, while others, despite their capabilities, perform only moderately. Performance drops further when distinguishing dehumanization from related hate types such as derogation. We also identify systematic disparities across target groups: models tend to over-predict dehumanization for some identities (e.g., Gay men), while under-identifying it for others (e.g., Refugees). These findings motivate the need for systematic, group-level evaluation when applying pretrained language models to dehumanization detection tasks.

  Efficient exploration is a well known problem in deep reinforcement learning and this problem is exacerbated in multi-agent reinforcement learning due the intrinsic complexities of such algorithms. There are several approaches to efficiently explore an environment to learn to solve tasks by multi-agent operating in that environment, of which, the idea of expert exploration is investigated in this work. More specifically, this work investigates the application of large-language models as expert planners for efficient exploration in planning based tasks for multiple agents.

  What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use. AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent systems.

  Multi-modal generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry. Particularly, two dominant families of techniques have emerged: i) Multi-modal large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability for multi-modal understanding; and ii) Diffusion models exhibit remarkable multi-modal powers in terms of multi-modal generation. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of multi-modal generative AI, including multi-modal LLMs, diffusions, and the unification for understanding and generation. To lay a solid foundation for unified models, we first provide a detailed review of both multi-modal LLMs and diffusion models respectively, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to image/video LLMs as well as text-to-image/video generation. Furthermore, we explore the emerging efforts toward unified models for understanding and generation. To achieve the unification of understanding and generation, we investigate key designs including autoregressive-based and diffusion-based modeling, as well as dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We then introduce several strategies for unified models, analyzing their potential advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we summarize the common datasets widely used for multi-modal generative AI pretraining. Last but not least, we present several challenging future research directions which may contribute to the ongoing advancement of multi-modal generative AI.

  The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences remains a key challenge. While post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have achieved notable success, they often introduce computational inefficiencies and training instability. In this paper, we propose Feature-level constrained Preference Optimization (FPO), a novel method designed to simplify the alignment process while ensuring stability. FPO leverages pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduces feature-level constraints, allowing for efficient, sparsity-enforced alignment. Our approach enjoys efficiency by using sparse features activated in a well-trained sparse autoencoder and the quality of sequential KL divergence by using the feature-level offline reference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FPO achieves a 5.08% absolute improvement in win rate with much lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines, making it a promising solution for efficient and controllable LLM alignments.

  Clinical information extraction, which involves structuring clinical concepts from unstructured medical text, remains a challenging problem that could benefit from the inclusion of tabular background information available in electronic health records. Existing open-source datasets lack explicit links between structured features and clinical concepts in the text, motivating the need for a new research dataset. We introduce SimSUM, a benchmark dataset of 10,000 simulated patient records that link unstructured clinical notes with structured background variables. Each record simulates a patient encounter in the domain of respiratory diseases and includes tabular data (e.g., symptoms, diagnoses, underlying conditions) generated from a Bayesian network whose structure and parameters are defined by domain experts. A large language model (GPT-4o) is prompted to generate a clinical note describing the encounter, including symptoms and relevant context. These notes are annotated with span-level symptom mentions. We conduct an expert evaluation to assess note quality and run baseline predictive models on both the tabular and textual data. The SimSUM dataset is primarily designed to support research on clinical information extraction in the presence of tabular background variables, which can be linked through domain knowledge to concepts of interest to be extracted from the text (symptoms, in the case of SimSUM). Secondary uses include research on the automation of clinical reasoning over both tabular data and text, causal effect estimation in the presence of tabular and/or textual confounders, and multi-modal synthetic data generation. SimSUM is not intended for training clinical decision support systems or production-grade models, but rather to facilitate reproducible research in a simplified and controlled setting. The dataset is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems. However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis, including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance, supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing intelligent legal assistance systems.

  Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+ parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by $62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

  This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health, Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention, the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229 objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions, particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work, we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs, while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and interpretable language model alignment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms, and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

  This study evaluates fine-tuned Llama 3.2 models for extracting vaccine-related information from emergency department triage notes to support near real-time vaccine safety surveillance. Prompt engineering was used to initially create a labeled dataset, which was then confirmed by human annotators. The performance of prompt-engineered models, fine-tuned models, and a rule-based approach was compared. The fine-tuned Llama 3 billion parameter model outperformed other models in its accuracy of extracting vaccine names. Model quantization enabled efficient deployment in resource-constrained environments. Findings demonstrate the potential of large language models in automating data extraction from emergency department notes, supporting efficient vaccine safety surveillance and early detection of emerging adverse events following immunization issues.

  Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified, user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living environments.

  Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data. To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug discovery.

  Large Language Models enable dynamic game interactions but struggle with rule-governed trading systems. Current implementations suffer from rule violations, such as item hallucinations and calculation errors, that erode player trust. Here, State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP) enables reliable trading through autonomous dialogue state inference and context-specific rule adherence. The approach decomposes trading into six states within a unified prompt framework, implementing context-aware item referencing and placeholder-based price calculations. Evaluation across 100 trading dialogues demonstrates >97% state compliance, >95% referencing accuracy, and 99.7% calculation precision. SIBP maintains computational efficiency while outperforming baseline approaches, establishing a practical foundation for trustworthy NPC interactions in commercial games.

  Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5, DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models, and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies, including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular, interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning, and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.
