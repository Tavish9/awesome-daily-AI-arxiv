  This paper introduces EmbodiedAgent, a hierarchical framework for heterogeneous multi-robot control. EmbodiedAgent addresses critical limitations of hallucination in impractical tasks. Our approach integrates a next-action prediction paradigm with a structured memory system to decompose tasks into executable robot skills while dynamically validating actions against environmental constraints. We present MultiPlan+, a dataset of more than 18,000 annotated planning instances spanning 100 scenarios, including a subset of impractical cases to mitigate hallucination. To evaluate performance, we propose the Robot Planning Assessment Schema (RPAS), combining automated metrics with LLM-aided expert grading. Experiments demonstrate EmbodiedAgent's superiority over state-of-the-art models, achieving 71.85% RPAS score. Real-world validation in an office service task highlights its ability to coordinate heterogeneous robots for long-horizon objectives.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Task execution for object rearrangement could be challenged by Task-Level Perturbations (TLP), i.e., unexpected object additions, removals, and displacements that can disrupt underlying visual policies and fundamentally compromise task feasibility and progress. To address these challenges, we present LangPert, a language-based framework designed to detect and mitigate TLP situations in tabletop rearrangement tasks. LangPert integrates a Visual Language Model (VLM) to comprehensively monitor policy's skill execution and environmental TLP, while leveraging the Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (HCoT) reasoning mechanism to enhance the Large Language Model (LLM)'s contextual understanding and generate adaptive, corrective skill-execution plans. Our experimental results demonstrate that LangPert handles diverse TLP situations more effectively than baseline methods, achieving higher task completion rates, improved execution efficiency, and potential generalization to unseen scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in understanding complex language and visual data, enabling generalist robotic systems to interpret instructions and perform embodied tasks. Nevertheless, their real-world deployment is hindered by substantial computational and storage demands. Recent insights into the homogeneous patterns in the LLM layer have inspired sparsification techniques to address these challenges, such as early exit and token pruning. However, these methods often neglect the critical role of the final layers that encode the semantic information most relevant to downstream robotic tasks. Aligning with the recent breakthrough of the Shallow Brain Hypothesis (SBH) in neuroscience and the mixture of experts in model sparsification, we conceptualize each LLM layer as an expert and propose a Mixture-of-Layers Vision-Language-Action model (MoLe-VLA, or simply MoLe) architecture for dynamic LLM layer activation. We introduce a Spatial-Temporal Aware Router (STAR) for MoLe to selectively activate only parts of the layers based on the robot's current state, mimicking the brain's distinct signal pathways specialized for cognition and causal reasoning. Additionally, to compensate for the cognitive ability of LLMs lost in MoLe, we devise a Cognition Self-Knowledge Distillation (CogKD) framework. CogKD enhances the understanding of task demands and improves the generation of task-relevant action sequences by leveraging cognitive features. Extensive experiments conducted in both RLBench simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the superiority of MoLe-VLA in both efficiency and performance. Specifically, MoLe-VLA achieves an 8% improvement in the mean success rate across ten tasks while reducing computational costs by up to x5.6 compared to standard LLMs.

- **[GeoNav: Empowering MLLMs with Explicit Geospatial Reasoning Abilities for Language-Goal Aerial Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09587)**  `arXiv:2504.09587`  `cs.RO`  
  _Haotian Xu, Yue Hu, Chen Gao, Zhengqiu Zhu, Yong Zhao, Yong Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language-goal aerial navigation is a critical challenge in embodied AI, requiring UAVs to localize targets in complex environments such as urban blocks based on textual specification. Existing methods, often adapted from indoor navigation, struggle to scale due to limited field of view, semantic ambiguity among objects, and lack of structured spatial reasoning. In this work, we propose GeoNav, a geospatially aware multimodal agent to enable long-range navigation. GeoNav operates in three phases-landmark navigation, target search, and precise localization-mimicking human coarse-to-fine spatial strategies. To support such reasoning, it dynamically builds two different types of spatial memory. The first is a global but schematic cognitive map, which fuses prior textual geographic knowledge and embodied visual cues into a top-down, annotated form for fast navigation to the landmark region. The second is a local but delicate scene graph representing hierarchical spatial relationships between blocks, landmarks, and objects, which is used for definite target localization. On top of this structured representation, GeoNav employs a spatially aware, multimodal chain-of-thought prompting mechanism to enable multimodal large language models with efficient and interpretable decision-making across stages. On the CityNav urban navigation benchmark, GeoNav surpasses the current state-of-the-art by up to 12.53% in success rate and significantly improves navigation efficiency, even in hard-level tasks. Ablation studies highlight the importance of each module, showcasing how geospatial representations and coarse-to-fine reasoning enhance UAV navigation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Being able to use tools is a widely recognised indicator of intelligence across species. Humans, for instance, have demonstrated mastery of tool use for over two million years. The ability to use tools is invaluable as it extends an organism's reach and enhances its capacity to interact with objects and the environment. Being able to understand the geometric-mechanical relations between the tools-objects-environments allows certain species (e.g., apes and crows) to reach food in narrow constrained spaces. The same principles of physical augmentation and its associated non-prehensile manipulation capabilities also apply to robotic systems. For example, by instrumenting them with different types of end-effectors, robots can (in principle) dexterously interact (e.g., push and flip) with objects of various shapes and masses akin to its biological counterpart. However, developing this type of manipulation skill is still an open research problem. Furthermore, the complexity of planning tool-object manipulation tasks, particularly in coordinating the actions of dual-arm robots, presents significant challenges. To address these complexities, we propose integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in planning and executing these intricate manipulations, thereby enhancing the robot's ability to perform in diverse scenarios.

- **[PestMA: LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Informed Pest Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09855)**  `arXiv:2504.09855`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI`  
  _Hongrui Shi, Shunbao Li, Zhipeng Yuan, Po Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective pest management is complex due to the need for accurate, context-specific decisions. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) open new possibilities for addressing these challenges by providing sophisticated, adaptive knowledge acquisition and reasoning. However, existing LLM-based pest management approaches often rely on a single-agent paradigm, which can limit their capacity to incorporate diverse external information, engage in systematic validation, and address complex, threshold-driven decisions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PestMA, an LLM-based multi-agent system (MAS) designed to generate reliable and evidence-based pest management advice. Building on an editorial paradigm, PestMA features three specialized agents, an Editor for synthesizing pest management recommendations, a Retriever for gathering relevant external data, and a Validator for ensuring correctness. Evaluations on real-world pest scenarios demonstrate that PestMA achieves an initial accuracy of 86.8% for pest management decisions, which increases to 92.6% after validation. These results underscore the value of collaborative agent-based workflows in refining and validating decisions, highlighting the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems to automate and enhance pest management processes.

  _Zhenting Wang, Guofeng Cui, Kun Wan, Wentian Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training have led to notable improvements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities to handle complex tasks. However, most existing methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the fact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse distributions-varying in both source and difficulty. This heterogeneity introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across distributions to optimize learning efficiency. In this paper, we present a principled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of distribution-level learnability. Our core insight is that the magnitude of policy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further training on a given distribution. Based on this, we propose a distribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM post-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to dynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions. This approach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage (exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and theoretically grounded training schedule. We instantiate our curriculum learning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and sources. Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves convergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of distribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.

- **[Mechanistic Anomaly Detection for "Quirky" Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08812)**  `arXiv:2504.08812`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _David O. Johnston, Arkajyoti Chakraborty, Nora Belrose_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As LLMs grow in capability, the task of supervising LLMs becomes more challenging. Supervision failures can occur if LLMs are sensitive to factors that supervisors are unaware of. We investigate Mechanistic Anomaly Detection (MAD) as a technique to augment supervision of capable models; we use internal model features to identify anomalous training signals so they can be investigated or discarded. We train detectors to flag points from the test environment that differ substantially from the training environment, and experiment with a large variety of detector features and scoring rules to detect anomalies in a set of ``quirky'' language models. We find that detectors can achieve high discrimination on some tasks, but no detector is effective across all models and tasks. MAD techniques may be effective in low-stakes applications, but advances in both detection and evaluation are likely needed if they are to be used in high stakes settings.

- **[I Predict Therefore I Am: Is Next Token Prediction Enough to Learn Human-Interpretable Concepts from Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08980)**  `arXiv:2503.08980`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Yuhang Liu, Dong Gong, Erdun Gao, Zhen Zhang, Biwei Huang, Mingming Gong, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) have led many to conclude that they exhibit a form of intelligence. This is as opposed to explanations of their capabilities based on their ability to perform relatively simple manipulations of vast volumes of data. To illuminate the distinction between these explanations, we introduce a novel generative model that generates tokens on the basis of human interpretable concepts represented as latent discrete variables. Under mild conditions, even when the mapping from the latent space to the observed space is non-invertible, we establish an identifiability result: the representations learned by LLMs through next-token prediction can be approximately modeled as the logarithm of the posterior probabilities of these latent discrete concepts, up to an invertible linear transformation. This theoretical finding not only provides evidence that LLMs capture underlying generative factors, but also strongly reinforces the linear representation hypothesis, which posits that LLMs learn linear representations of human-interpretable concepts. Empirically, we validate our theoretical results through evaluations on both simulation data and the Pythia, Llama, and DeepSeek model families.

- **[Beyond Chinchilla-Optimal: Accounting for Inference in Language Model Scaling Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00448)**  `arXiv:2401.00448`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Nikhil Sardana, Jacob Portes, Sasha Doubov, Jonathan Frankle_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language model (LLM) scaling laws are empirical formulas that estimate changes in model quality as a result of increasing parameter count and training data. However, these formulas, including the popular Deepmind Chinchilla scaling laws, neglect to include the cost of inference. We modify the Chinchilla scaling laws to calculate the optimal LLM parameter count and pre-training data size to train and deploy a model of a given quality and inference demand. We conduct our analysis both in terms of a compute budget and real-world costs and find that LLM researchers expecting reasonably large inference demand (~1B requests) should train models smaller and longer than Chinchilla-optimal. Furthermore, we train 47 models of varying sizes and parameter counts to validate our formula and find that model quality continues to improve as we scale tokens per parameter to extreme ranges (up to 10,000). Finally, we ablate the procedure used to fit the Chinchilla scaling law coefficients and find that developing scaling laws only from data collected at typical token/parameter ratios overestimates the impact of additional tokens at these extreme ranges.

- **[KeepKV: Eliminating Output Perturbation in KV Cache Compression for Efficient LLMs Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09936)**  `arXiv:2504.09936`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Yuxuan Tian, Zihan Wang, Yebo Peng, Aomufei Yuan, Zhiming Wang, Bairen Yi, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by an ever-growing key-value (KV) cache, making KV cache compression a critical research direction. Traditional methods selectively evict less important KV cache entries based on attention scores or position heuristics, which leads to information loss and hallucinations. Recently, merging-based strategies have been explored to retain more information by merging KV pairs that would be discarded; however, these existing approaches inevitably introduce inconsistencies in attention distributions before and after merging, causing output perturbation and degraded generation quality. To overcome this challenge, we propose KeepKV, a novel adaptive KV cache merging method designed to eliminate output perturbation while preserving performance under strict memory constraints. KeepKV introduces the Electoral Votes mechanism that records merging history and adaptively adjusts attention scores. Moreover, it further leverages a novel Zero Inference-Perturbation Merging methods, keeping attention consistency and compensating for attention loss resulting from cache merging. KeepKV successfully retains essential context information within a significantly compressed cache. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLM architectures demonstrate that KeepKV substantially reduces memory usage, enhances inference throughput by more than 2x and keeps superior generation quality even with 10% KV cache budgets.

- **[AgentRewardBench: Evaluating Automatic Evaluations of Web Agent Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08942)**  `arXiv:2504.08942`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Xing Han L√π, Amirhossein Kazemnejad, Nicholas Meade, Arkil Patel, Dongchan Shin, Alejandra Zambrano, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Web agents enable users to perform tasks on web browsers through natural language interaction. Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at:this https URL

- **[Wormhole Memory: A Rubik's Cube for Cross-Dialogue Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14846)**  `arXiv:2501.14846`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Libo Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In view of the gap in the current large language model in sharing memory across dialogues, this research proposes a wormhole memory module (WMM) to realize memory as a Rubik's cube that can be arbitrarily retrieved between different dialogues. Through simulation experiments, the researcher built an experimental framework based on the Python environment and used setting memory barriers to simulate the current situation where memories between LLMs dialogues are difficult to share. The CoQA development data set was imported into the experiment, and the feasibility of its cross-dialogue memory retrieval function was verified for WMM's nonlinear indexing and dynamic retrieval, and a comparative analysis was conducted with the capabilities of Titans and MemGPT memory modules. Experimental results show that WMM demonstrated the ability to retrieve memory across dialogues and the stability of quantitative indicators in eight experiments. It contributes new technical approaches to the optimization of memory management of LLMs and provides experience for the practical application in the future.

- **[Block-Attention for Efficient Prefilling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15355)**  `arXiv:2409.15355`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Dongyang Ma, Yan Wang, Lan Tian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Block-attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context in an auto-regressive manner. Instead, Block-attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-attention involves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-attention mechanism. Experiments on 11 diverse benchmarks, including RAG, ICL, and general domains, demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block-attention model not only achieves performance comparable to that of full-attention models, but can also seamlessly switch between the block and full attention modes without any performance loss. Notably, Block-attention significantly reduces the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared to the full-attention models, the TTFT and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7% and 99.8%, respectively. Additionally, in Appendix A, we elaborate on how Block-attention is applied in Game AI scenario and the substantial potential benefits it entails. We strongly suggest researchers in the gaming field not to overlook this section.

- **[GeoUni: A Unified Model for Generating Geometry Diagrams, Problems and Problem Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10146)**  `arXiv:2504.10146`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Jo-Ku Cheng, Zeren Zhang, Ran Chen, Jingyang Deng, Ziran Qin, Jinwen Ma_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose GeoUni, the first unified geometry expert model capable of generating problem solutions and diagrams within a single framework in a way that enables the creation of unique and individualized geometry problems. Traditionally, solving geometry problems and generating diagrams have been treated as separate tasks in machine learning, with no models successfully integrating both to support problem creation. However, we believe that mastery in geometry requires frictionless integration of all of these skills, from solving problems to visualizing geometric relationships, and finally, crafting tailored problems. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUni, with only 1.5B parameters, achieves performance comparable to larger models such as DeepSeek-R1 with 671B parameters in geometric reasoning tasks. GeoUni also excels in generating precise geometric diagrams, surpassing both text-to-image models and unified models, including the GPT-4o image generation. Most importantly, GeoUni is the only model capable of successfully generating textual problems with matching diagrams based on specific knowledge points, thus offering a wider range of capabilities that extend beyond current models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-thought reasoning enables large language models to solve multi-step tasks by framing problem solving as sequential decision problems. Outcome-based rewards, which provide feedback only on final answers, show impressive success, but face challenges with credit assignment and slow convergence. In contrast, procedure-based rewards offer efficient step-level feedback, but typically require costly human supervision. We introduce \emph{Backwards Adaptive Reward Shaping} (BARS), a no-regret framework that converts sparse outcomes-based rewards into effective procedure-based signals. BARS uses sparse rewards generated from terminal-state priors and cover trees to scale rewards while preventing exploitation. With Bellman contraction and $(\Delta, \epsilon)$-gap rewards, our backward Euler solver achieves $\epsilon$-accuracy in $O\left((R_{\max}/\Delta)\log(1/\epsilon)\right)$ iterations with $O(\log T)$ dynamic regret over $T$ rounds. Our analysis, based on generic chaining, continuous scaling limits, and non-linear Feynman-Kac bounds, connects recent outcome-based methods' empirical successes with the benefits of intermediate supervision. Combined, this provides the first rigorous no-regret algorithm for outcome reward shaping, providing a theoretical foundation for the empirical success of DeepSeek's R1.

- **[Can LLMs Revolutionize the Design of Explainable and Efficient TinyML Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09685)**  `arXiv:2504.09685`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces a novel framework for designing efficient neural network architectures specifically tailored to tiny machine learning (TinyML) platforms. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) for neural architecture search (NAS), a vision transformer (ViT)-based knowledge distillation (KD) strategy, and an explainability module, the approach strikes an optimal balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory usage. The LLM-guided search explores a hierarchical search space, refining candidate architectures through Pareto optimization based on accuracy, multiply-accumulate operations (MACs), and memory metrics. The best-performing architectures are further fine-tuned using logits-based KD with a pre-trained ViT-B/16 model, which enhances generalization without increasing model size. Evaluated on the CIFAR-100 dataset and deployed on an STM32H7 microcontroller (MCU), the three proposed models, LMaNet-Elite, LMaNet-Core, and QwNet-Core, achieve accuracy scores of 74.50%, 74.20% and 73.00%, respectively. All three models surpass current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, such as MCUNet-in3/in4 (69.62% / 72.86%) and XiNet (72.27%), while maintaining a low computational cost of less than 100 million MACs and adhering to the stringent 320 KB static random-access memory (SRAM) constraint. These results demonstrate the efficiency and performance of the proposed framework for TinyML platforms, underscoring the potential of combining LLM-driven search, Pareto optimization, KD, and explainability to develop accurate, efficient, and interpretable models. This approach opens new possibilities in NAS, enabling the design of efficient architectures specifically suited for TinyML.

  _Colin Samplawski, Adam D. Cobb, Susmit Jha_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computer-aided design (CAD) is a promising application area for emerging artificial intelligence methods. Traditional workflows for cyberphysical systems create detailed digital models which can be evaluated by physics simulators in order to narrow the search space before creating physical prototypes. A major bottleneck of this approach is that the simulators are often computationally expensive and slow. Recent advancements in AI methods offer the possibility to accelerate these pipelines. We use the recently released AircraftVerse dataset, which is especially suited for developing and evaluating large language models for designs. AircraftVerse contains a diverse set of UAV designs represented via textual design trees together with detailed physics simulation results. Following the recent success of large language models (LLMs), we propose AGENT (Aircraft GENeraTor). AGENT is a comprehensive design tool built on the CodeT5+ LLM which learns powerful representations of aircraft textual designs directly from JSON files. We develop a curriculum of training tasks which imbues a single model with a suite of useful features. AGENT is able to generate designs conditioned on properties of flight dynamics (hover time, maximum speed, etc.). Additionally, AGENT can issue evaluations of designs allowing it to act as a surrogate model of the physics simulation that underlies the AircraftVerse dataset. We present a series of experiments which demonstrate our system's abilities. We are able to achieve strong performance using the smallest member of the CodeT5+ family (220M parameters). This allows for a flexible and powerful system which can be executed on a single GPU enabling a clear path toward future deployment.

- **[Long Context In-Context Compression by Getting to the Gist of Gisting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08934)**  `arXiv:2504.08934`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Aleksandar Petrov, Mark Sandler, Andrey Zhmoginov, Nolan Miller, Max Vladymyrov_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long context processing is critical for the adoption of LLMs, but existing methods often introduce architectural complexity that hinders their practical adoption. Gisting, an in-context compression method with no architectural modification to the decoder transformer, is a promising approach due to its simplicity and compatibility with existing frameworks. While effective for short instructions, we demonstrate that gisting struggles with longer contexts, with significant performance drops even at minimal compression rates. Surprisingly, a simple average pooling baseline consistently outperforms gisting. We analyze the limitations of gisting, including information flow interruptions, capacity limitations and the inability to restrict its attention to subsets of the context. Motivated by theoretical insights into the performance gap between gisting and average pooling, and supported by extensive experimentation, we propose GistPool, a new in-context compression method. GistPool preserves the simplicity of gisting, while significantly boosting its performance on long context compression tasks.

  _Neil He, Jiahong Liu, Buze Zhang, Ngoc Bui, Ali Maatouk, Menglin Yang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the era of foundation models and Large Language Models (LLMs), Euclidean space has been the de facto geometric setting for machine learning architectures. However, recent literature has demonstrated that this choice comes with fundamental limitations. At a large scale, real-world data often exhibit inherently non-Euclidean structures, such as multi-way relationships, hierarchies, symmetries, and non-isotropic scaling, in a variety of domains, such as languages, vision, and the natural sciences. It is challenging to effectively capture these structures within the constraints of Euclidean spaces. This position paper argues that moving beyond Euclidean geometry is not merely an optional enhancement but a necessity to maintain the scaling law for the next-generation of foundation models. By adopting these geometries, foundation models could more efficiently leverage the aforementioned structures. Task-aware adaptability that dynamically reconfigures embeddings to match the geometry of downstream applications could further enhance efficiency and expressivity. Our position is supported by a series of theoretical and empirical investigations of prevalent foundationthis http URL, we outline a roadmap for integrating non-Euclidean geometries into foundation models, including strategies for building geometric foundation models via fine-tuning, training from scratch, and hybrid approaches.

- **[Distilling and exploiting quantitative insights from Large Language Models for enhanced Bayesian optimization of chemical reactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08874)**  `arXiv:2504.08874`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  Machine learning and Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms can significantly accelerate the optimization of chemical reactions. Transfer learning can bolster the effectiveness of BO algorithms in low-data regimes by leveraging pre-existing chemical information or data outside the direct optimization task (i.e., source data). Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that chemical information present in foundation training data can give them utility for processing chemical data. Furthermore, they can be augmented with and help synthesize potentially multiple modalities of source chemical data germane to the optimization task. In this work, we examine how chemical information from LLMs can be elicited and used for transfer learning to accelerate the BO of reaction conditions to maximize yield. Specifically, we show that a survey-like prompting scheme and preference learning can be used to infer a utility function which models prior chemical information embedded in LLMs over a chemical parameter space; we find that the utility function shows modest correlation to true experimental measurements (yield) over the parameter space despite operating in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, we show that the utility function can be leveraged to focus BO efforts in promising regions of the parameter space, improving the yield of the initial BO query and enhancing optimization in 4 of the 6 datasets studied. Overall, we view this work as a step towards bridging the gap between the chemistry knowledge embedded in LLMs and the capabilities of principled BO methods to accelerate reaction optimization.

  Recently, slow-thinking systems like GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated great potential in solving challenging problems through explicit reflection. They significantly outperform the best fast-thinking models, such as GPT-4o, on various math and science benchmarks. However, their multimodal reasoning capabilities remain on par with fast-thinking models. For instance, GPT-o1's performance on benchmarks like MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision is similar to fast-thinking models. In this paper, we aim to enhance the slow-thinking capabilities of vision-language models using reinforcement learning (without relying on distillation) to advance the state of the art. First, we adapt the GRPO algorithm with a novel technique called Selective Sample Replay (SSR) to address the vanishing advantages problem. While this approach yields strong performance, the resulting RL-trained models exhibit limited self-reflection or self-verification. To further encourage slow-thinking, we introduce Forced Rethinking, which appends a textual rethinking trigger to the end of initial rollouts in RL training, explicitly enforcing a self-reflection reasoning step. By combining these two techniques, our model, VL-Rethinker, advances state-of-the-art scores on MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision to achieve 80.3%, 61.8%, and 43.9% respectively. VL-Rethinker also achieves open-source SoTA on multi-disciplinary benchmarks such as MMMU-Pro, EMMA, and MEGA-Bench, narrowing the gap with GPT-o1.

  Using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) as the backbone for time series prediction has recently gained significant research interest. However, the effectiveness of LLM backbones in this domain remains a topic of debate. Based on thorough empirical analyses, we observe that training and testing LLM-based models on small datasets often leads to the Encoder and Decoder becoming overly adapted to the dataset, thereby obscuring the true predictive capabilities of the LLM backbone. To investigate the genuine potential of LLMs in time series prediction, we introduce three pre-training models with identical architectures but different pre-training strategies. Thereby, large-scale pre-training allows us to create unbiased Encoder and Decoder components tailored to the LLM backbone. Through controlled experiments, we evaluate the zero-shot and few-shot prediction performance of the LLM, offering insights into its capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal that although the LLM backbone demonstrates some promise, its forecasting performance is limited.

  Large language models ($\textbf{LLMs}$) have emerged as a powerful method for discovery. Instead of utilizing numerical data, LLMs utilize associated variable $\textit{semantic metadata}$ to predict variable relationships. Simultaneously, LLMs demonstrate impressive abilities to act as black-box optimizers when given an objective $f$ and sequence of trials. We study LLMs at the intersection of these two capabilities by applying LLMs to the task of $\textit{interactive graph discovery}$: given a ground truth graph $G^*$ capturing variable relationships and a budget of $I$ edge experiments over $R$ rounds, minimize the distance between the predicted graph $\hat{G}_R$ and $G^*$ at the end of the $R$-th round. To solve this task we propose $\textbf{IGDA}$, a LLM-based pipeline incorporating two key components: 1) an LLM uncertainty-driven method for edge experiment selection 2) a local graph update strategy utilizing binary feedback from experiments to improve predictions for unselected neighboring edges. Experiments on eight different real-world graphs show our approach often outperforms all baselines including a state-of-the-art numerical method for interactive graph discovery. Further, we conduct a rigorous series of ablations dissecting the impact of each pipeline component. Finally, to assess the impact of memorization, we apply our interactive graph discovery strategy to a complex, new (as of July 2024) causal graph on protein transcription factors, finding strong performance in a setting where memorization is impossible. Overall, our results show IGDA to be a powerful method for graph discovery complementary to existing numerically driven approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper comprehensively evaluates several recently proposed optimizers for 4-bit training, revealing that low-bit precision amplifies sensitivity to learning rates and often causes unstable gradient norms, leading to divergence at higher learning rates. Among these, SPAM, a recent optimizer featuring momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping, achieves the best performance across various bit levels, but struggles to stabilize gradient norms, requiring careful learning rate tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Stable-SPAM, which incorporates enhanced gradient normalization and clipping techniques. In particular, Stable-SPAM (1) adaptively updates the clipping threshold for spiked gradients by tracking their historical maxima; (2) normalizes the entire gradient matrix based on its historical $l_2$-norm statistics; and $(3)$ inherits momentum reset from SPAM to periodically reset the first and second moments of Adam, mitigating the accumulation of spiked gradients. Extensive experiments show that Stable-SPAM effectively stabilizes gradient norms in 4-bit LLM training, delivering superior performance compared to Adam and SPAM. Notably, our 4-bit LLaMA-1B model trained with Stable-SPAM outperforms the BF16 LLaMA-1B trained with Adam by up to $2$ perplexity. Furthermore, when both models are trained in 4-bit, Stable-SPAM achieves the same loss as Adam while requiring only about half the training steps. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Effective reasoning is crucial to solving complex mathematical problems. Recent large language models (LLMs) have boosted performance by scaling test-time computation through long chain-of-thought reasoning. However, transformer-based models are inherently limited in extending context length due to their quadratic computational complexity and linear memory requirements. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid linear RNN reasoning model, M1, built on the Mamba architecture, which allows memory-efficient inference. Our approach leverages a distillation process from existing reasoning models and is further enhanced through RL training. Experimental results on the AIME and MATH benchmarks show that M1 not only outperforms previous linear RNN models but also matches the performance of state-of-the-art Deepseek R1 distilled reasoning models at a similar scale. We also compare our generation speed with a highly performant general purpose inference engine, vLLM, and observe more than a 3x speedup compared to a same size transformer. With throughput speedup, we are able to achieve higher accuracy compared to DeepSeek R1 distilled transformer reasoning models under a fixed generation time budget using self-consistency voting. Overall, we introduce a hybrid Mamba reasoning model and provide a more effective approach to scaling test-time generation using self-consistency or long chain of thought reasoning.

  Millimeter-wave radar provides a privacy-preserving solution for human motion analysis, yet its sparse point clouds pose significant challenges for semantic understanding. We present Radar-LLM, the first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for human motion understanding using millimeter-wave radar as the sensing modality. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a motion-guided radar tokenizer based on our Aggregate VQ-VAE architecture that incorporates deformable body templates and masked trajectory modeling to encode spatiotemporal point clouds into compact semantic tokens, and (2) a radar-aware language model that establishes cross-modal alignment between radar and text in a shared embedding space. To address data scarcity, we introduce a physics-aware synthesis pipeline that generates realistic radar-text pairs from motion-text datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Radar-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, enabling accurate translation of millimeter-wave signals to natural language descriptions. This breakthrough facilitates comprehensive motion understanding in privacy-sensitive applications like healthcare and smart homes. We will release the full implementation to support further research onthis https URL.

  The primary goal of my Ph.D. study is to develop provably efficient and practical algorithms for data-driven online sequential decision-making under uncertainty. My work focuses on reinforcement learning (RL), multi-armed bandits, and their applications, including recommendation systems, computer networks, video analytics, and large language models (LLMs). Online learning methods, such as bandits and RL, have demonstrated remarkable success - ranging from outperforming human players in complex games like Atari and Go to advancing robotics, recommendation systems, and fine-tuning LLMs. Despite these successes, many established algorithms rely on idealized models that can fail under model misspecifications or adversarial perturbations, particularly in settings where accurate prior knowledge of the underlying model class is unavailable or where malicious users operate within dynamic systems. These challenges are pervasive in real-world applications, where robust and adaptive solutions are critical. Furthermore, while worst-case guarantees provide theoretical reliability, they often fail to capture instance-dependent performance, which can lead to more efficient and practical solutions. Another key challenge lies in generalizing to new, unseen environments, a crucial requirement for deploying these methods in dynamic and unpredictable settings. To address these limitations, my research aims to develop more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable online learning algorithms for both reinforcement learning and bandits. Towards this end, I focus on developing more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable for both general reinforcement learning (RL) and bandits.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance response quality by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with vector databases, enabling external knowledge retrieval to support language model reasoning. While RAG enables efficient question answering with smaller LLMs, existing optimizations for vector search and LLM serving have largely been developed in isolation. As a result, their integration often leads to suboptimal end-to-end performance. ... This paper introduces VectorLiteRAG, an optimized vector index partitioning mechanism designed for RAG systems that enhances the responsiveness of the system by jointly optimizing vector search and LLM serving across CPU and GPU system. A key challenge is to determine which indices and how much of the vector index should reside on the GPU and adjusting LLM batch sizes to balance the pipeline for lower Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and meeting user-defined Service-Level Objectives (SLOs). To address this, we leverage the insight that cluster access in vector databases exhibits access skew, where a subset of clusters are queried significantly more frequently than others. VectorLiteRAG exploits this property through an optimized memory distribution strategy, dynamically allocating the minimum number of vector indices corresponding to frequently accessed clusters onto the GPU HBM to ensure a balanced pipeline with the LLM for high responsiveness. This adaptive partitioning scheme is guided by a statistical model that informs memory allocation and workload distribution. Our evaluation demonstrates that VectorLiteRAG improves vector search responsiveness by 2x, significantly reduces end-to-end TTFT in RAG systems by intelligently balancing memory resources between vector search and LLM execution.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a promising approach to robust and explainable Question Answering (QA). While LLMs excel at natural language understanding, they suffer from knowledge gaps and hallucinations. KGs provide structured knowledge but lack natural language interaction. Ideally, an AI system should be both robust to missing facts as well as easy to communicate with. This paper proposes such a system that integrates LLMs and KGs without requiring training, ensuring adaptability across different KGs with minimal human effort. The resulting approach can be classified as a specific form of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with a KG, thus, it is dubbed Knowledge Graph-extended Retrieval Augmented Generation (KG-RAG). It includes a question decomposition module to enhance multi-hop information retrieval and answer explainability. Using In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, it generates explicit reasoning chains processed separately to improve truthfulness. Experiments on the MetaQA benchmark show increased accuracy for multi-hop questions, though with a slight trade-off in single-hop performance compared to LLM with KG baselines. These findings demonstrate KG-RAG's potential to improve transparency in QA by bridging unstructured language understanding with structured knowledge retrieval.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning capabilities on complex multimodal understanding tasks, they still suffer from the notorious hallucination issue: generating outputs misaligned with obvious visual or factual evidence. Currently, training-based solutions, like direct preference optimization (DPO), leverage paired preference data to suppress hallucinations. However, they risk sacrificing general reasoning capabilities due to the likelihood displacement. Meanwhile, training-free solutions, like contrastive decoding, achieve this goal by subtracting the estimated hallucination pattern from a distorted input. Yet, these handcrafted perturbations (e.g., add noise to images) may poorly capture authentic hallucination patterns. To avoid these weaknesses of existing methods, and realize robust hallucination mitigation (i.e., maintaining general reasoning performance), we propose a novel framework: Decoupling Contrastive Decoding (DCD). Specifically, DCD decouples the learning of positive and negative samples in preference datasets, and trains separate positive and negative image projections within the MLLM. The negative projection implicitly models real hallucination patterns, which enables vision-aware negative images in the contrastive decoding inference stage. Our DCD alleviates likelihood displacement by avoiding pairwise optimization and generalizes robustly without handcrafted degradation. Extensive ablations across hallucination benchmarks and general reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of DCD, i.e., it matches DPO's hallucination suppression while preserving general capabilities and outperforms the handcrafted contrastive decoding methods.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have provided new opportunities for decision-making, particularly in the task of automated feature selection. In this paper, we first comprehensively evaluate LLM-based feature selection methods, covering the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-R1, GPT-o3-mini, and GPT-4.5. Then, we propose a novel hybrid strategy called LLM4FS that integrates LLMs with traditional data-driven methods. Specifically, input data samples into LLMs, and directly call traditional data-driven techniques such as random forest and forward sequential selection. Notably, our analysis reveals that the hybrid strategy leverages the contextual understanding of LLMs and the high statistical reliability of traditional data-driven methods to achieve excellent feature selection performance, even surpassing LLMs and traditional data-driven methods. Finally, we point out the limitations of its application in decision-making.

  Test-time scaling has significantly improved large language model performance, enabling deeper reasoning to solve complex problems. However, this increased reasoning capability also leads to excessive token generation and unnecessary problem-solving attempts. We introduce Dont Answer Bench (DNA Bench), a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs ability to robustly understand the tricky reasoning triggers and avoiding unnecessary generation. DNA Bench consists of 150 adversarially designed prompts that are easy for humans to understand and respond to, but surprisingly not for many of the recent prominent LLMs. DNA Bench tests models abilities across different capabilities, such as instruction adherence, hallucination avoidance, redundancy filtering, and unanswerable question recognition. We evaluate reasoning LLMs (RLMs), including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI O3-mini, Claude-3.7-sonnet and compare them against a powerful non-reasoning model, e.g., GPT-4o. Our experiments reveal that RLMs generate up to 70x more tokens than necessary, often failing at tasks that simpler non-reasoning models handle efficiently with higher accuracy. Our findings underscore the need for more effective training and inference strategies in RLMs.

  The need for effective unlearning mechanisms in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly urgent, driven by the necessity to adhere to data regulations and foster ethical generative AI practices. Despite growing interest of LLM unlearning, much of the existing research has focused on varied unlearning method designs to boost effectiveness and efficiency. However, the inherent relationship between model weights and LLM unlearning has not been extensively examined. In this paper, we systematically explore how model weights interact with unlearning processes in LLMs and we design the weight attribution-guided LLM unlearning method, WAGLE, which unveils the interconnections between 'influence' of weights and 'influence' of data to forget and retain in LLM generation. By strategically guiding the LLM unlearning across different types of unlearning methods and tasks, WAGLE can erase the undesired content, while maintaining the performance of the original tasks. We refer to the weight attribution-guided LLM unlearning method as WAGLE, which unveils the interconnections between 'influence' of weights and 'influence' of data to forget and retain in LLM generation. Our extensive experiments show that WAGLE boosts unlearning performance across a range of LLM unlearning methods such as gradient difference and (negative) preference optimization, applications such as fictitious unlearning, malicious use prevention, and copyrighted information removal, and models including Zephyr-7b-beta and Llama2-7b. To the best of our knowledge, our work offers the first principled method for attributing and pinpointing the influential weights in enhancing LLM unlearning. It stands in contrast to previous methods that lack weight attribution and simpler weight attribution techniques.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success across various tasks. However, efficiently serving LLMs has been a challenge due to the large memory bottleneck, specifically in small batch inference settings (e.g. mobile devices). Weight-only quantization can be a promising approach, but sub-4 bit quantization remains a challenge due to large-magnitude activation outliers. To mitigate the undesirable outlier effect, we first propose per-IC quantization, a simple yet effective method that creates quantization groups within each input channel (IC) rather than the conventional per-output-channel (per-OC). Our method is motivated by the observation that activation outliers affect the input dimension of the weight matrix, so similarly grouping the weights in the IC direction can isolate outliers within a group. We also find that activation outliers do not dictate quantization difficulty, and inherent weight sensitivities also exist. With per-IC quantization as a new outlier-friendly scheme, we propose Adaptive Dimensions (AdaDim), a versatile quantization framework that can adapt to various weight sensitivity patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaDim by augmenting prior methods such as Round-To-Nearest and GPTQ, showing significant improvements across various language modeling benchmarks for both base (up to +4.7% on MMLU) and instruction-tuned (up to +10% on HumanEval) LLMs. Code is available atthis https URL

  Sign language is the primary communication mode for 72 million hearing-impaired individuals worldwide, necessitating effective bidirectional Sign Language Production and Sign Language Translation systems. However, functional bidirectional systems require a unified linguistic environment, hindered by the lack of suitable unified datasets, particularly those providing the necessary pose information for accurate Sign Language Production (SLP) evaluation. Concurrently, current SLP evaluation methods like back-translation ignore pose accuracy, and high-quality coordinated generation remains challenging. To create this crucial environment and overcome these challenges, we introduce CNText2Sign and CNSign, which together constitute the first unified dataset aimed at supporting bidirectional accessibility systems for Chinese sign language; CNText2Sign provides 15,000 natural language-to-sign mappings and standardized skeletal keypoints for 8,643 vocabulary items supporting pose assessment. Building upon this foundation, we propose the AuraLLM model, which leverages a decoupled architecture with CNText2Sign's pose data for novel direct gesture accuracy assessment. The model employs retrieval augmentation and Cascading Vocabulary Resolution to handle semantic mapping and out-of-vocabulary words and achieves all-scenario production with controllable coordination of gestures and facial expressions via pose-conditioned video synthesis. Concurrently, our Sign Language Translation model SignMST-C employs targeted self-supervised pretraining for dynamic feature capture, achieving new SOTA results on PHOENIX2014-T with BLEU-4 scores up to 32.08. AuraLLM establishes a strong performance baseline on CNText2Sign with a BLEU-4 score of 50.41 under direct evaluation.

  Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), they may over-rely on visual language priors existing in their training data rather than true visual reasoning. To investigate this, we introduce ViLP, a benchmark featuring deliberately out-of-distribution images synthesized via image generation models and out-of-distribution Q&A pairs. Each question in ViLP is coupled with three potential answers and three corresponding images: one that can be resolved by text priors alone and two that demand visual reasoning. Although, humans achieve near-perfect accuracy, modern VLMs falter; for instance, GPT-4 achieves only 66.17% on ViLP. To alleviate this, we propose a self-improving framework in which models generate new VQA data, then apply pixel-level and semantic corruptions to form "good-bad" image pairs for self-training. Our training objectives compel VLMs to focus more on the actual visual inputs, and we demonstrate their effectiveness in boosting the performance of open-source VLMs, including LLaVA-v1.5 and Cambrian.

  Image representations are often evaluated through disjointed, task-specific protocols, leading to a fragmented understanding of model capabilities. For instance, it is unclear whether an image embedding model adept at clustering images is equally good at retrieving relevant images given a piece of text. We introduce the Massive Image Embedding Benchmark (MIEB) to evaluate the performance of image and image-text embedding models across the broadest spectrum to date. MIEB spans 38 languages across 130 individual tasks, which we group into 8 high-level categories. We benchmark 50 models across our benchmark, finding that no single method dominates across all task categories. We reveal hidden capabilities in advanced vision models such as their accurate visual representation of texts, and their yet limited capabilities in interleaved encodings and matching images and texts in the presence of confounders. We also show that the performance of vision encoders on MIEB correlates highly with their performance when used in multimodal large language models.

  Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence. However, visual reasoning, reasoning involving both visual and textual inputs, remains underexplored. Recent advancements, including the reasoning models like OpenAI o1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, which incorporate image inputs, have opened this capability. In this ongoing work, we focus specifically on photography-related tasks because a photo is a visual snapshot of the physical world where the underlying physics (i.e., illumination, blur extent, etc.) interplay with the camera parameters. Successfully reasoning from the visual information of a photo to identify these numerical camera settings requires the MLLMs to have a deeper understanding of the underlying physics for precise visual comprehension, representing a challenging and intelligent capability essential for practical applications like photography assistant agents. We aim to evaluate MLLMs on their ability to distinguish visual differences related to numerical camera settings, extending a methodology previously proposed for vision-language models (VLMs). Our preliminary results demonstrate the importance of visual reasoning in photography-related tasks. Moreover, these results show that no single MLLM consistently dominates across all evaluation tasks, demonstrating ongoing challenges and opportunities in developing MLLMs with better visual reasoning.

  Recently DeepSeek R1 has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a simple yet effective design. The core of R1 lies in its rule-based reward formulation, which leverages tasks with deterministic ground-truth answers to enable precise and stable reward computation. In the visual domain, we similarly observe that a wide range of visual understanding tasks are inherently equipped with well-defined ground-truth annotations. This property makes them naturally compatible with rule-based reward mechanisms. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the extension of R1-style reinforcement learning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their visual reasoning capabilities. To this end, we develop VLM-R1, a dedicated framework designed to harness RL for improving VLMs' performance on general vision-language tasks. Using this framework, we further explore the feasibility of applying RL to visual domain. Experimental results indicate that the RL-based model not only delivers competitive performance on visual understanding tasks but also surpasses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in generalization ability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies that uncover a series of noteworthy insights, including the presence of reward hacking in object detection, the emergence of the "OD aha moment", the impact of training data quality, and the scaling behavior of RL across different model sizes. Through these analyses, we aim to deepen the understanding of how reinforcement learning enhances the capabilities of vision-language models, and we hope our findings and open-source contributions will support continued progress in the vision-language RL community.

  The emergence of medical generalist foundation models has revolutionized conventional task-specific model development paradigms, aiming to better handle multiple tasks through joint training on large-scale medical datasets. However, recent advances prioritize simple data scaling or architectural component enhancement, while neglecting to re-examine multi-task learning from a data-centric perspective. Critically, simply aggregating existing data resources leads to decentralized image-task alignment, which fails to cultivate comprehensive image understanding or align with clinical needs for multi-dimensional image interpretation. In this paper, we introduce the image-centric multi-annotation X-ray dataset (IMAX), the first attempt to enhance the multi-task learning capabilities of medical multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) from the data construction level. To be specific, IMAX is featured from the following attributes: 1) High-quality data curation. A comprehensive collection of more than 354K entries applicable to seven different medical tasks. 2) Image-centric dense annotation. Each X-ray image is associated with an average of 4.10 tasks and 7.46 training entries, ensuring multi-task representation richness per image. Compared to the general decentralized multi-annotation X-ray dataset (DMAX), IMAX consistently demonstrates significant multi-task average performance gains ranging from 3.20% to 21.05% across seven open-source state-of-the-art medical MLLMs. Moreover, we investigate differences in statistical patterns exhibited by IMAX and DMAX training processes, exploring potential correlations between optimization dynamics and multi-task performance. Finally, leveraging the core concept of IMAX data construction, we propose an optimized DMAX-based training strategy to alleviate the dilemma of obtaining high-quality IMAX data in practical scenarios.

  Improving the efficiency of inference in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical area of research. Post-training Quantization (PTQ) is a popular technique, but it often faces challenges at low-bit levels, particularly in downstream tasks. Quantization-aware Training (QAT) can alleviate this problem, but it requires significantly more computational resources. To tackle this, we introduced Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Quantization-Aware Training (DL-QAT), which merges the advantages of QAT while training only less than 1% of the total parameters. Specifically, we introduce a group-specific quantization magnitude to adjust the overall scale of each quantization group. Within each quantization group, we use LoRA matrices to update the weight size and direction in the quantization space. We validated the effectiveness of our method on the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families. The results show significant improvements over our baseline method across different quantization granularities. For instance, for LLaMA-7B, our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.2% in MMLU on 3-bit LLaMA-7B model. Additionally, our quantization results on pre-trained models also surpass previous QAT methods, demonstrating the superior performance and efficiency of our approach.

  This research aims to comprehensively explore building a multimodal foundation model for egocentric video understanding. To achieve this goal, we work on three fronts. First, as there is a lack of QA data for egocentric video understanding, we automatically generate 7M high-quality QA samples for egocentric videos ranging from 30 seconds to one hour long in Ego4D based on human-annotated data. This is one of the largest egocentric QA datasets. Second, we contribute a challenging egocentric QA benchmark with 629 videos and 7,026 questions to evaluate the models' ability in recognizing and memorizing visual details across videos of varying lengths. We introduce a new de-biasing evaluation method to help mitigate the unavoidable language bias present in the models being evaluated. Third, we propose a specialized multimodal architecture featuring a novel "Memory Pointer Prompting" mechanism. This design includes a \textit{global glimpse} step to gain an overarching understanding of the entire video and identify key visual information, followed by a fallback step that utilizes the key visual information to generate responses. This enables the model to more effectively comprehend extended video content. With the data, benchmark, and model, we build MM-Ego, an egocentric multimodal LLM that shows powerful performance on egocentric video understanding.

  Long-context video understanding in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) faces a critical challenge: balancing computational efficiency with the retention of fine-grained spatio-temporal patterns. Existing approaches (e.g., sparse sampling, dense sampling with low resolution, and token compression) suffer from significant information loss in temporal dynamics, spatial details, or subtle interactions, particularly in videos with complex motion or varying resolutions. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{Mavors}$, a novel framework that introduces $\mathbf{M}$ulti-gr$\mathbf{a}$nularity $\mathbf{v}$ide$\mathbf{o}$ $\mathbf{r}$epre$\mathbf{s}$entation for holistic long-video modeling. Specifically, Mavors directly encodes raw video content into latent representations through two core components: 1) an Intra-chunk Vision Encoder (IVE) that preserves high-resolution spatial features via 3D convolutions and Vision Transformers, and 2) an Inter-chunk Feature Aggregator (IFA) that establishes temporal coherence across chunks using transformer-based dependency modeling with chunk-level rotary position encodings. Moreover, the framework unifies image and video understanding by treating images as single-frame videos via sub-image decomposition. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate Mavors' superiority in maintaining both spatial fidelity and temporal continuity, significantly outperforming existing methods in tasks requiring fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a range of multimodal tasks; however, their practical deployment is often constrained by high computational costs and prolonged inference times. Since the vision modality typically carries more information than the text modality, compressing visual prompts offers a promising solution to alleviate these challenges. Existing approaches predominantly focus on refining model architectures or directly reducing the number of visual tokens. However, these methods often compromise inference performance due to a lack of consideration for the unique spatial and temporal characteristics of visual data. In this work, we propose a token compression paradigm that operates on both spatial and temporal dimensions. Our approach includes a learning-free, plug-and-play compression pipeline that can be seamlessly integrated into most Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) frameworks. By leveraging this method, we enhance the model inference capability while simultaneously reducing its computational cost. Experimental results on the Video-QA task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing significant improvements in efficiency without sacrificing performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in video generation have posed great challenges in the assessment of AI-generated content, particularly with the emergence of increasingly sophisticated models. The various inconsistencies and defects observed in such videos are inherently complex, making overall scoring notoriously difficult. In this paper, we emphasize the critical importance of integrating fine-grained reasoning into video evaluation, and we propose $\textbf{F}$ing$\textbf{ER}$, a novel entity-level reasoning evaluation framework that first automatically generates $\textbf{F}$ine-grained $\textbf{E}$ntity-level questions, and then answers those questions by a $\textbf{R}$easoning model with scores, which can be subsequently weighted summed to an overall score for different applications. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to derive entity-level questions across five distinct perspectives, which (i) often focus on some specific entities of the content, thereby making answering or scoring much easier by MLLMs, and (ii) are more interpretable. Then we construct a FingER dataset, consisting of approximately 3.3k videos and corresponding 60k fine-grained QA annotations, each with detailed reasons. Based on that, we further investigate various training protocols to best incentivize the reasoning capability of MLLMs for correct answer prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a reasoning model trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a cold-start strategy achieves the best performance. Notably, our model surpasses existing methods by a relative margin of $11.8\%$ on GenAI-Bench and $5.5\%$ on MonetBench with only 3.3k training videos, which is at most one-tenth of the training samples utilized by other methods. Our code and dataset will be released soon.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current object detectors often suffer significant perfor-mance degradation in real-world applications when encountering distributional shifts. Consequently, the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capability of object detectors has garnered increasing attention from researchers. Despite this growing interest, there remains a lack of a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and evaluation benchmark with fine-grained annotations tailored to assess the OOD generalization on more intricate tasks like object detection and grounding. To address this gap, we introduce COUNTS, a large-scale OOD dataset with object-level annotations. COUNTS encompasses 14 natural distributional shifts, over 222K samples, and more than 1,196K labeled bounding boxes. Leveraging COUNTS, we introduce two novel benchmarks: O(OD)2 and OODG. O(OD)2 is designed to comprehensively evaluate the OOD generalization capabilities of object detectors by utilizing controlled distribution shifts between training and testing data. OODG, on the other hand, aims to assess the OOD generalization of grounding abilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our findings reveal that, while large models and extensive pre-training data substantially en hance performance in in-distribution (IID) scenarios, significant limitations and opportunities for improvement persist in OOD contexts for both object detectors and MLLMs. In visual grounding tasks, even the advanced GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 only achieve 56.7% and 28.0% accuracy, respectively. We hope COUNTS facilitates advancements in the development and assessment of robust object detectors and MLLMs capable of maintaining high performance under distributional shifts.

  Tracking multiple objects based on textual queries is a challenging task that requires linking language understanding with object association across frames. Previous works typically train the whole process end-to-end or integrate an additional referring text module into a multi-object tracker, but they both require supervised training and potentially struggle with generalization to open-set queries. In this work, we introduce ReferGPT, a novel zero-shot referring multi-object tracking framework. We provide a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with spatial knowledge enabling it to generate 3D-aware captions. This enhances its descriptive capabilities and supports a more flexible referring vocabulary without training. We also propose a robust query-matching strategy, leveraging CLIP-based semantic encoding and fuzzy matching to associate MLLM generated captions with user queries. Extensive experiments on Refer-KITTI, Refer-KITTIv2 and Refer-KITTI+ demonstrate that ReferGPT achieves competitive performance against trained methods, showcasing its robustness and zero-shot capabilities in autonomous driving.

  The rapid development of generative AI is a double-edged sword, which not only facilitates content creation but also makes image manipulation easier and more difficult to detect. Although current image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods are generally effective, they tend to face two challenges: \textbf{1)} black-box nature with unknown detection principle, \textbf{2)} limited generalization across diverse tampering methods (e.g., Photoshop, DeepFake, AIGC-Editing). To address these issues, we propose the explainable IFDL task and design FakeShield, a multi-modal framework capable of evaluating image authenticity, generating tampered region masks, and providing a judgment basis based on pixel-level and image-level tampering clues. Additionally, we leverage GPT-4o to enhance existing IFDL datasets, creating the Multi-Modal Tamper Description dataSet (MMTD-Set) for training FakeShield's tampering analysis capabilities. Meanwhile, we incorporate a Domain Tag-guided Explainable Forgery Detection Module (DTE-FDM) and a Multi-modal Forgery Localization Module (MFLM) to address various types of tamper detection interpretation and achieve forgery localization guided by detailed textual descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FakeShield effectively detects and localizes various tampering techniques, offering an explainable and superior solution compared to previous IFDL methods.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hallucinate, resulting in an emerging topic of visual hallucination evaluation (VHE). This paper contributes a ChatGPT-Prompted visual hallucination evaluation Dataset (PhD) for objective VHE at a large scale. The essence of VHE is to ask an MLLM questions about specific images to assess its susceptibility to hallucination. Depending on what to ask (objects, attributes, sentiment, etc.) and how the questions are asked, we structure PhD along two dimensions, i.e. task and mode. Five visual recognition tasks, ranging from low-level (object / attribute recognition) to middle-level (sentiment / position recognition and counting), are considered. Besides a normal visual QA mode, which we term PhD-base, PhD also asks questions with specious context (PhD-sec) or with incorrect context ({PhD-icc), or with AI-generated counter common sense images (PhD-ccs). We construct PhD by a ChatGPT-assisted semi-automated pipeline, encompassing four pivotal modules: task-specific hallucinatory item (hitem) selection, hitem-embedded question generation, specious / incorrect context generation, and counter-common-sense (CCS) image generation. With over 14k daily images, 750 CCS images and 102k VQA triplets in total, PhD reveals considerable variability in MLLMs' performance across various modes and tasks, offering valuable insights into the nature of hallucination. As such, PhD stands as a potent tool not only for VHE but may also play a significant role in the refinement of MLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce InternVL3, a significant advancement in the InternVL series featuring a native multimodal pre-training paradigm. Rather than adapting a text-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and linguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora during a single pre-training stage. This unified training paradigm effectively addresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in conventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve performance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position encoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed preference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies alongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of multi-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the MMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its capabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models, including ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also maintaining strong pure-language proficiency. In pursuit of open-science principles, we will publicly release both the training data and model weights to foster further research and development in next-generation MLLMs.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve remarkable performance for fine-grained pixel-level understanding tasks. However, all the works rely heavily on extra components, such as vision encoder (CLIP), segmentation experts, leading to high system complexity and limiting model scaling. In this work, our goal is to explore a highly simplified MLLM without introducing extra components. Our work is motivated by the recent works on Single trAnsformer as a unified vIsion-Language Model (SAIL) design, where these works jointly learn vision tokens and text tokens in transformers. We present Pixel-SAIL, a single transformer for pixel-wise MLLM tasks. In particular, we present three technical improvements on the plain baseline. First, we design a learnable upsampling module to refine visual token features. Secondly, we propose a novel visual prompt injection strategy to enable the single transformer to understand visual prompt inputs and benefit from the early fusion of visual prompt embeddings and vision tokens. Thirdly, we introduce a vision expert distillation strategy to efficiently enhance the single transformer's fine-grained feature extraction capability. In addition, we have collected a comprehensive pixel understanding benchmark (PerBench), using a manual check. It includes three tasks: detailed object description, visual prompt-based question answering, and visual-text referring segmentation. Extensive experiments on four referring segmentation benchmarks, one visual prompt benchmark, and our PerBench show that our Pixel-SAIL achieves comparable or even better results with a much simpler pipeline.

  This paper introduces SAIL, a single transformer unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) that integrates raw pixel encoding and language decoding within a singular architecture. Unlike existing modular MLLMs, which rely on a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT), SAIL eliminates the need for a separate vision encoder, presenting a more minimalist architecture design. Instead of introducing novel architectural components, SAIL adapts mix-attention mechanisms and multimodal positional encodings to better align with the distinct characteristics of visual and textual modalities. We systematically compare SAIL's properties-including scalability, cross-modal information flow patterns, and visual representation capabilities-with those of modular MLLMs. By scaling both training data and model size, SAIL achieves performance comparable to modular MLLMs. Notably, the removal of pretrained ViT components enhances SAIL's scalability and results in significantly different cross-modal information flow patterns. Moreover, SAIL demonstrates strong visual representation capabilities, achieving results on par with ViT-22B in vision tasks such as semantic segmentation.

  Multimodal foundation models have significantly improved feature representation by integrating information from multiple modalities, making them highly suitable for a broader set of applications. However, the exploration of multimodal facial representation for understanding perception has been limited. Understanding and analyzing facial states, such as Action Units (AUs) and emotions, require a comprehensive and robust framework that bridges visual and linguistic modalities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive pipeline for multimodal facial state analysis. First, we compile a new Multimodal Face Dataset (MFA) by generating detailed multilevel language descriptions of face, incorporating Action Unit (AU) and emotion descriptions, by leveraging GPT-4o. Second, we introduce a novel Multilevel Multimodal Face Foundation model (MF^2) tailored for Action Unit (AU) and emotion recognition. Our model incorporates comprehensive visual feature modeling at both local and global levels of face image, enhancing its ability to represent detailed facial appearances. This design aligns visual representations with structured AU and emotion descriptions, ensuring effective cross-modal integration. Third, we develop a Decoupled Fine-Tuning Network (DFN) that efficiently adapts MF^2 across various tasks and datasets. This approach not only reduces computational overhead but also broadens the applicability of the foundation model to diverse scenarios. Experimentation show superior performance for AU and emotion detection tasks.

  In recent years, significant advancements have been made in text-driven 3D content generation. However, several challenges remain. In practical applications, users often provide extremely simple text inputs while expecting high-quality 3D content. Generating optimal results from such minimal text is a difficult task due to the strong dependency of text-to-3D models on the quality of input prompts. Moreover, the generation process exhibits high variability, making it difficult to control. Consequently, multiple iterations are typically required to produce content that meets user expectations, reducing generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose GPT-4V for self-optimization, which significantly enhances the efficiency of generating satisfactory content in a single attempt. Furthermore, the controllability of text-to-3D generation methods has not been fully explored. Our approach enables users to not only provide textual descriptions but also specify additional conditions, such as style, edges, scribbles, poses, or combinations of multiple conditions, allowing for more precise control over the generated 3D content. Additionally, during training, we effectively integrate multi-view information, including multi-view depth, masks, features, and images, to address the common Janus problem in 3D content generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalization, facilitating the efficient and controllable generation of high-quality 3D content.

  We introduce FUSION, a family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with a fully vision-language alignment and integration paradigm. Unlike existing methods that primarily rely on late-stage modality interaction during LLM decoding, our approach achieves deep, dynamic integration throughout the entire processing pipeline. To this end, we propose Text-Guided Unified Vision Encoding, incorporating textual information in vision encoding to achieve pixel-level integration. We further design Context-Aware Recursive Alignment Decoding that recursively aggregates visual features conditioned on textual context during decoding, enabling fine-grained, question-level semantic integration. To guide feature mapping and mitigate modality discrepancies, we develop Dual-Supervised Semantic Mapping Loss. Additionally, we construct a Synthesized Language-Driven Question-Answer (QA) dataset through a new data synthesis method, prioritizing high-quality QA pairs to optimize text-guided feature integration. Building on these foundations, we train FUSION at two scales-3B, 8B-and demonstrate that our full-modality integration approach significantly outperforms existing methods with only 630 vision tokens. Notably, FUSION 3B surpasses Cambrian-1 8B and Florence-VL 8B on most benchmarks. FUSION 3B continues to outperform Cambrian-1 8B even when limited to 300 vision tokens. Our ablation studies show that FUSION outperforms LLaVA-NeXT on over half of the benchmarks under same configuration without dynamic resolution, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable versatility in understanding diverse multimodal data and tasks. However, these capabilities come with an increased model scale. While post-training pruning reduces model size in unimodal models, its application to MLLMs often yields limited success. Our analysis discovers that conventional methods fail to account for the unique token attributes across layers and modalities inherent to MLLMs. Inspired by this observation, we propose TAMP, a simple yet effective pruning framework tailored for MLLMs, featuring two key components: (1) Diversity-Aware Sparsity, which adjusts sparsity ratio per layer based on diversities among multimodal output tokens, preserving more parameters in high-diversity layers; and (2) Adaptive Multimodal Input Activation, which identifies representative multimodal input tokens using attention scores to guide unstructured weight pruning. We validate our method on two state-of-the-art MLLMs: LLaVA-NeXT, designed for vision-language tasks, and VideoLLaMA2, capable of processing audio, visual, and language modalities. Empirical experiments across various multimodal evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that each component of our approach substantially outperforms existing pruning techniques.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable versatility but face challenges in demonstrating true visual understanding, particularly in chart reasoning tasks. Existing benchmarks like ChartQA reveal significant reliance on text-based shortcuts and probabilistic pattern-matching rather than genuine visual reasoning. To rigorously evaluate visual reasoning, we introduce a more challenging test scenario by removing textual labels and introducing chart perturbations in the ChartQA dataset. Under these conditions, models like GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0 Pro experience up to a 30% performance drop, underscoring their limitations. To address these challenges, we propose Socratic Chart, a new framework that transforms chart images into Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) representations, enabling MLLMs to integrate textual and visual modalities for enhanced chart understanding. Socratic Chart employs a multi-agent pipeline with specialized agent-generators to extract primitive chart attributes (e.g., bar heights, line coordinates) and an agent-critic to validate results, ensuring high-fidelity symbolic representations. Our framework surpasses state-of-the-art models in accurately capturing chart primitives and improving reasoning performance, establishing a robust pathway for advancing MLLM visual understanding.

  Remote sensing has become critical for understanding environmental dynamics, urban planning, and disaster management. However, traditional remote sensing workflows often rely on explicit segmentation or detection methods, which struggle to handle complex, implicit queries that require reasoning over spatial context, domain knowledge, and implicit user intent. Motivated by this, we introduce a new task, \ie, geospatial pixel reasoning, which allows implicit querying and reasoning and generates the mask of the target region. To advance this task, we construct and release the first large-scale benchmark dataset called EarthReason, which comprises 5,434 manually annotated image masks with over 30,000 implicit question-answer pairs. Moreover, we propose SegEarth-R1, a simple yet effective language-guided segmentation baseline that integrates a hierarchical visual encoder, a large language model (LLM) for instruction parsing, and a tailored mask generator for spatial correlation. The design of SegEarth-R1 incorporates domain-specific adaptations, including aggressive visual token compression to handle ultra-high-resolution remote sensing images, a description projection module to fuse language and multi-scale features, and a streamlined mask prediction pipeline that directly queries description embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegEarth-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both reasoning and referring segmentation tasks, significantly outperforming traditional and LLM-based segmentation methods.

  Advertisement videos serve as a rich and valuable source of purpose-driven information, encompassing high-quality visual, textual, and contextual cues designed to engage viewers. They are often more complex than general videos of similar duration due to their structured narratives and rapid scene transitions, posing significant challenges to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we introduce VideoAds, the first dataset tailored for benchmarking the performance of MLLMs on advertisement videos. VideoAds comprises well-curated advertisement videos with complex temporal structures, accompanied by \textbf{manually} annotated diverse questions across three core tasks: visual finding, video summary, and visual reasoning. We propose a quantitative measure to compare VideoAds against existing benchmarks in terms of video complexity. Through extensive experiments, we find that Qwen2.5-VL-72B, an opensource MLLM, achieves 73.35\% accuracy on VideoAds, outperforming GPT-4o (66.82\%) and Gemini-1.5 Pro (69.66\%); the two proprietary models especially fall behind the opensource model in video summarization and reasoning, but perform the best in visual finding. Notably, human experts easily achieve a remarkable accuracy of 94.27\%. These results underscore the necessity of advancing MLLMs' temporal modeling capabilities and highlight VideoAds as a potentially pivotal benchmark for future research in understanding video that requires high FPS sampling.

- **[Head-Aware KV Cache Compression for Efficient Visual Autoregressive Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09261)**  `arXiv:2504.09261`  `cs.CV`

  Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have emerged as a powerful approach for multi-modal content creation, offering high efficiency and quality across diverse multimedia applications. However, they face significant memory bottlenecks due to extensive KV cache accumulation during inference. Existing KV cache compression techniques for large language models are suboptimal for VAR models due to, as we identify in this paper, two distinct categories of attention heads in VAR models: Structural Heads, which preserve spatial coherence through diagonal attention patterns, and Contextual Heads, which maintain semantic consistency through vertical attention patterns. These differences render single-strategy KV compression techniques ineffective for VAR models. To address this, we propose HACK, a training-free Head-Aware Compression method for KV cache. HACK allocates asymmetric cache budgets and employs pattern-specific compression strategies tailored to the essential characteristics of each head category. Experiments on Infinity-2B, Infinity-8B, and VAR-d30 demonstrate its effectiveness in text-to-image and class-conditional generation tasks. HACK can hack down up to 50\% and 70\% of cache with minimal performance degradation for VAR-d30 and Infinity-8B, respectively. Even with 70\% and 90\% KV cache compression in VAR-d30 and Infinity-8B, HACK still maintains high-quality generation while reducing memory usage by 44.2\% and 58.9\%, respectively.

  Existing Masked Image Modeling methods apply fixed mask patterns to guide the self-supervised training. As those mask patterns resort to different criteria to depict image contents, sticking to a fixed pattern leads to a limited vision cues modelingthis http URLpaper introduces an evolved hierarchical masking method to pursue general visual cues modeling in self-supervised learning. The proposed method leverages the vision model being trained to parse the input visual cues into a hierarchy structure, which is hence adopted to generate masks accordingly. The accuracy of hierarchy is on par with the capability of the model being trained, leading to evolved mask patterns at different training stages. Initially, generated masks focus on low-level visual cues to grasp basic textures, then gradually evolve to depict higher-level cues to reinforce the learning of more complicated object semantics and contexts. Our method does not require extra pre-trained models or annotations and ensures training efficiency by evolving the training difficulty. We conduct extensive experiments on seven downstream tasks including partial-duplicate image retrieval relying on low-level details, as well as image classification and semantic segmentation that require semantic parsing capability. Experimental results demonstrate that it substantially boosts performance across these tasks. For instance, it surpasses the recent MAE by 1.1\% in imageNet-1K classification and 1.4\% in ADE20K segmentation with the same training epochs. We also align the proposed method with the current research focus on LLMs. The proposed approach bridges the gap with large-scale pre-training on semantic demanding tasks and enhances intricate detail perception in tasks requiring low-level feature recognition.

  Safety hazard identification and prevention are the key elements of proactive safety management. Previous research has extensively explored the applications of computer vision to automatically identify hazards from image clips collected from construction sites. However, these methods struggle to identify context-specific hazards, as they focus on detecting predefined individual entities without understanding their spatial relationships and interactions. Furthermore, their limited adaptability to varying construction site guidelines and conditions hinders their generalization across different projects. These limitations reduce their ability to assess hazards in complex construction environments and adaptability to unseen risks, leading to potential safety gaps. To address these challenges, we proposed and experimentally validated a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based framework for the identification of construction hazards. The framework incorporates a prompt engineering module that structures safety guidelines into contextual queries, allowing VLM to process visual information and generate hazard assessments aligned with the regulation guide. Within this framework, we evaluated state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini, Llama 3.2, and InternVL2, using a custom dataset of 1100 construction site images. Experimental results show that GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro outperformed alternatives and displayed promising BERTScore of 0.906 and 0.888 respectively, highlighting their ability to identify both general and context-specific hazards. However, processing times remain a significant challenge, impacting real-time feasibility. These findings offer insights into the practical deployment of VLMs for construction site hazard detection, thereby contributing to the enhancement of proactive safety management.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modality image fusion aims to synthesize a single, comprehensive image from multiple source inputs. Traditional approaches, such as CNNs and GANs, offer efficiency but struggle to handle low-quality or complex inputs. Recent advances in text-guided methods leverage large model priors to overcome these limitations, but at the cost of significant computational overhead, both in memory and inference time. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for distilling large model priors, eliminating the need for text guidance during inference while dramatically reducing model size. Our framework utilizes a teacher-student architecture, where the teacher network incorporates large model priors and transfers this knowledge to a smaller student network via a tailored distillation process. Additionally, we introduce spatial-channel cross-fusion module to enhance the model's ability to leverage textual priors across both spatial and channel dimensions. Our method achieves a favorable trade-off between computational efficiency and fusion quality. The distilled network, requiring only 10% of the parameters and inference time of the teacher network, retains 90% of its performance and outperforms existing SOTA methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The implementation will be made publicly available as an open-source resource.

  Recent advancements in reinforcement learning have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.

  Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved performance on computer vision tasks. Previous image classification methods primarily modify model architectures or add features, and they optimize models using cross-entropy loss on class logits. Since they focus on classifying images with considering class labels, these methods may struggle to learn various \emph{aspects} of classes (e.g., natural positions and shape changes). Rethinking the previous approach from a novel view, we propose a multi-aspect knowledge distillation method using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our approach involves: 1) querying Large Language Model with multi-aspect questions relevant to the knowledge we want to transfer to the model, 2) extracting corresponding logits from MLLM, and 3) expanding the model's output dimensions to distill these multi-aspect logits. We then apply cross-entropy loss to class logits and binary cross-entropy loss to multi-aspect logits. Through our method, the model can learn not only the knowledge about visual aspects but also the abstract and complex aspects that require a deeper understanding. We primarily apply our method to image classification, and to explore the potential for extending our model, such as object detection. In all experimental results, our method improves the performance of the baselines. Additionally, we analyze the effect of multi-aspect knowledge distillation. These results demonstrate that our method can transfer knowledge about various aspects to the model and the aspect knowledge can enhance model performance in computer vision tasks.

  4D content generation aims to create dynamically evolving 3D content that responds to specific input objects such as images or 3D representations. Current approaches typically incorporate physical priors to animate 3D representations, but these methods suffer from significant limitations: they not only require users lacking physics expertise to manually specify material properties but also struggle to effectively handle the generation of multi-material composite objects. To address these challenges, we propose Phys4DGen, a novel 4D generation framework that integrates multi-material composition perception with physical simulation. The framework achieves automated, physically plausible 4D generation through three innovative modules: first, the 3D Material Grouping module partitions heterogeneous material regions on 3D representation surfaces via semantic segmentation; second, the Internal Physical Structure Discovery module constructs the mechanical structure of object interiors; finally, we distill physical prior knowledge from multimodal large language models to enable rapid and automatic material properties identification for both objects' surfaces and interiors. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Phys4DGen can generate high-fidelity 4D content with physical realism in open-world scenarios, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

  Recent advances in foundational Vision Language Models (VLMs) have reshaped the evaluation paradigm in computer vision tasks. These foundational models, especially CLIP, have accelerated research in open-vocabulary computer vision tasks, including Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS). Although the initial results are promising, the dense prediction capabilities of VLMs still require further improvement. In this study, we enhance the semantic segmentation performance of CLIP by introducing new modules and modifications: 1) architectural changes in the last layer of ViT and the incorporation of attention maps from the middle layers with the last layer, 2) Image Engineering: applying data augmentations to enrich input image representations, and 3) using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate definitions and synonyms for each class name to leverage CLIP's open-vocabulary capabilities. Our training-free method, ITACLIP, outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on segmentation benchmarks such as COCO-Stuff, COCO-Object, Pascal Context, and Pascal VOC.

  In video editing, the hallmark of a quality edit lies in its consistent and unobtrusive adjustment. Modification, when integrated, must be smooth and subtle, preserving the natural flow and aligning seamlessly with the original vision. Therefore, our primary focus is on overcoming the current challenges in high quality edit to ensure that each edit enhances the final product without disrupting its intended essence. However, quality deterioration such as blurring and flickering is routinely observed in recent diffusion video editing systems. We confirm that this deterioration often stems from high-frequency leak: the diffusion model fails to accurately synthesize high-frequency components during denoising process. To this end, we devise Frequency Adapting Group (FRAG) which enhances the video quality in terms of consistency and fidelity by introducing a novel receptive field branch to preserve high-frequency components during the denoising process. FRAG is performed in a model-agnostic manner without additional training and validates the effectiveness on video editing benchmarks (i.e., TGVE, DAVIS).

  Code LLMs have shown promising results with converting tasks in natural language to programs that can be executed by service robots. We are interested in finetuning small, specialized LLMs for this purpose, but collecting datasets of task-program pairs specific to each robot is time-consuming and expensive. While approaches such as SELF-INSTRUCT and EVOL-INSTRUCT are capable of generating novel tasks given a few examples, they are unable to provide the corresponding programs that correctly abide by physical-world and robot-constraints using the provided programming interface. Using a simulator is a natural potential solution to checking for such constraints, but building simulation environments that can handle arbitrary tasks and their necessary objects and locations, is challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce ROBO-INSTRUCT, which synthesizes task-specific simulation environments on the fly during program execution, by opportunistically inferring entity properties and enforcing corresponding constraints based on how the entities are used in the task program. Additionally, ROBO-INSTRUCT integrates an LLM-aided post-processing procedure to refine instructions for better alignment with robot programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ROBO-INSTRUCT across multiple LLMs, showing that our fine-tuned models outperform all baseline methods and even match or surpass the performance of several larger and proprietary models.

  Scientific equation discovery is a fundamental task in the history of scientific progress, enabling the derivation of laws governing natural phenomena. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained interest for this task due to their potential to leverage embedded scientific knowledge for hypothesis generation. However, evaluating the true discovery capabilities of these methods remains challenging, as existing benchmarks often rely on common equations that are susceptible to memorization by LLMs, leading to inflated performance metrics that do not reflect discovery. In this paper, we introduce LLM-SRBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 239 challenging problems across four scientific domains specifically designed to evaluate LLM-based scientific equation discovery methods while preventing trivial memorization. Our benchmark comprises two main categories: LSR-Transform, which transforms common physical models into less common mathematical representations to test reasoning beyond memorized forms, and LSR-Synth, which introduces synthetic, discovery-driven problems requiring data-driven reasoning. Through extensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art methods, using both open and closed LLMs, we find that the best-performing system so far achieves only 31.5% symbolic accuracy. These findings highlight the challenges of scientific equation discovery, positioning LLM-SRBench as a valuable resource for future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language model unlearning has become a critical challenge in ensuring safety and controlled model behavior by removing undesired data-model influences from the pretrained model while preserving general utility. Significant recent efforts have been dedicated to developing LLM unlearning benchmarks such as WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy) and MUSE (Machine Unlearning Six-way Evaluation), facilitating standardized unlearning performance assessment and method comparison. Despite their usefulness, we uncover for the first time a novel coreset effect within these benchmarks. Specifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full) forget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset (functioning as a "coreset"), e.g., as little as 5% of the forget set, even when selected at random. This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks can be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime. We demonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM unlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU (Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks. The surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data selection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated heuristic approaches. We explain the coreset effect in LLM unlearning through a keyword-based perspective, showing that keywords extracted from the forget set alone contribute significantly to unlearning effectiveness and indicating that current unlearning is driven by a compact set of high-impact tokens rather than the entire dataset. We further justify the faithfulness of coreset-unlearned models along additional dimensions, such as mode connectivity and robustness to jailbreaking attacks. Codes are available atthis https URL.

  Large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) methods have proven highly effective in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for tasks with verifiable solutions such as mathematics and coding. However, applying this idea to machine translation (MT), where outputs are flexibly formatted and difficult to automatically evaluate with explicit rules, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MT-R1-Zero, the first open-source adaptation of the R1-Zero RL framework for MT without supervised fine-tuning or cold-start. We propose a rule-metric mixed reward mechanism to guide LLMs towards improved translation quality via emergent reasoning. On the WMT 24 English-Chinese benchmark, our MT-R1-Zero-3B-Mix achieves competitive performance, surpassing TowerInstruct-7B-v0.2 by an average of 1.26 points. Meanwhile, our MT-R1-Zero-7B-Mix attains a high average score of 62.25 across all metrics, placing it on par with advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet, while the MT-R1-Zero-7B-Sem variant achieves state-of-the-art scores on semantic metrics. Moreover, our work exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution MT tasks, robustly supporting multilingual and low-resource settings. Extensive analysis of model behavior across different initializations and reward metrics offers pioneering insight into the critical role of reward design, LLM adaptability, training dynamics, and emergent reasoning patterns within the R1-Zero paradigm for MT.

  Commonsense reasoning deals with the implicit knowledge that is well understood by humans and typically acquired via interactions with the world. In recent times, commonsense reasoning and understanding of various LLMs have been evaluated using text-based tasks. In this work, we argue that a proxy of this understanding can be maintained as a graphical structure that can further help to perform a rigorous evaluation of commonsense reasoning abilities about various real-world activities. We create an annotation scheme for capturing this implicit knowledge in the form of a graphical structure for 37 daily human activities. We find that the created resource can be used to frame an enormous number of commonsense queries (~ 10^{17}), facilitating rigorous evaluation of commonsense reasoning in LLMs. Moreover, recently, the remarkable performance of LLMs has raised questions about whether these models are truly capable of reasoning in the wild and, in general, how reasoning occurs inside these models. In this resource paper, we bridge this gap by proposing design mechanisms that facilitate research in a similar direction. Our findings suggest that the reasoning components are localized in LLMs that play a prominent role in decision-making when prompted with a commonsense query.

  Large language models~(LLMs) are expected to be helpful, harmless, and honest. In various alignment scenarios, such as general human preference, safety, and confidence alignment, binary preference data collection and reward modeling are resource-intensive but necessary for human preference transferring. In this work, we explore using the similarity between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as an alternative reward function for LLM alignment. Using similarity as a reward circumvents training reward models, and collecting a single reference answer potentially costs less time than constructing binary preference pairs when multiple candidates are available. Specifically, we develop \textit{RefAlign}, a versatile REINFORCE-style alignment algorithm, which is free of reference and reward models. Instead, RefAlign utilizes BERTScore between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as the surrogate reward. Beyond general human preference optimization, RefAlign can be readily extended to diverse scenarios, such as safety and confidence alignment, by incorporating the similarity reward with task-related objectives. In various scenarios, {RefAlign} demonstrates comparable performance to previous alignment methods while offering high efficiency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scientists often infer abstract procedures from specific instances of problems and use the abstractions to generate new, related instances. For example, programs encoding the formal rules and properties of a system have been useful in fields ranging from RL (procedural environments) to physics (simulation engines). These programs can be seen as functions which execute to different outputs based on their parameterizations (e.g., gridworld configuration or initial physical conditions). We introduce the term EFA (Executable Functional Abstraction) to denote such programs for math problems. EFA-like constructs have been shown to be useful for math reasoning as problem generators for stress-testing models. However, prior work has been limited to abstractions for grade-school math (whose simple rules are easy to encode in programs), while generating EFAs for advanced math has thus far required human engineering. We explore the automatic construction of EFAs for advanced math problems. We operationalize the task of automatically constructing EFAs as a program synthesis task, and develop EFAGen, which conditions an LLM on a seed math problem and its step-by-step solution to generate candidate EFA programs that are faithful to the generalized problem and solution class underlying the seed problem. Furthermore, we formalize properties any valid EFA must possess in terms of executable unit tests, and show how the tests can be used as verifiable rewards to train LLMs to become better writers of EFAs. We demonstrate that EFAs constructed by EFAGen behave rationally by remaining faithful to seed problems, produce learnable problem variations, and that EFAGen can infer EFAs across multiple diverse sources of competition-level math problems. Finally, we show downstream uses of model-written EFAs e.g. finding problem variations that are harder or easier for a learner to solve, as well as data generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. However, a critical challenge remains in that they sometimes generate factually incorrect answers. To address this, while many previous work has focused on identifying errors in their generation and further refining them, they are slow in deployment since they are designed to verify the response from LLMs only after their entire generation (from the first to last tokens) is done. Further, we observe that once LLMs generate incorrect tokens early on, there is a higher likelihood that subsequent tokens will also be factually incorrect. To this end, in this work, we propose Streaming-VR (Streaming Verification and Refinement), a novel approach designed to enhance the efficiency of verification and refinement of LLM outputs. Specifically, the proposed Streaming-VR enables on-the-fly verification and correction of tokens as they are being generated, similar to a streaming process, ensuring that each subset of tokens is checked and refined in real-time by another LLM as the LLM constructs its response. Through comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the factual accuracy of LLMs, but also offers a more efficient solution compared to prior refinement methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to reduce hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). These methods work by constructing contrastive samples to induce hallucinations and then suppressing them in the output distribution. However, this paper demonstrates that such approaches fail to effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. The performance improvements observed on POPE Benchmark are largely driven by two misleading factors: (1) crude, unidirectional adjustments to the model's output distribution and (2) the adaptive plausibility constraint, which reduces the sampling strategy to greedy search. To further illustrate these issues, we introduce a series of spurious improvement methods and evaluate their performance against contrastive decoding techniques. Experimental results reveal that the observed performance gains in contrastive decoding are entirely unrelated to its intended goal of mitigating hallucinations. Our findings challenge common assumptions about the effectiveness of contrastive decoding strategies and pave the way for developing genuinely effective solutions to hallucinations in MLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge editing has emerged as an effective approach for updating large language models (LLMs) by modifying their internal knowledge. However, their application to the biomedical domain faces unique challenges due to the long-tailed distribution of biomedical knowledge, where rare and infrequent information is prevalent. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study to investigate the effectiveness of knowledge editing methods for editing long-tail biomedical knowledge. Our results indicate that, while existing editing methods can enhance LLMs' performance on long-tail biomedical knowledge, their performance on long-tail knowledge remains inferior to that on high-frequency popular knowledge, even after editing. Our further analysis reveals that long-tail biomedical knowledge contains a significant amount of one-to-many knowledge, where one subject and relation link to multiple objects. This high prevalence of one-to-many knowledge limits the effectiveness of knowledge editing in improving LLMs' understanding of long-tail biomedical knowledge, highlighting the need for tailored strategies to bridge this performance gap.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce S1-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate Large Reasoning Models' (LRMs) performance on simple tasks that favor intuitive system 1 thinking rather than deliberative system 2 reasoning. While LRMs have achieved significant breakthroughs in complex reasoning tasks through explicit chains of thought, their reliance on deep analytical thinking may limit their system 1 thinking capabilities. Moreover, a lack of benchmark currently exists to evaluate LRMs' performance in tasks that require such capabilities. To fill this gap, S1-Bench presents a set of simple, diverse, and naturally clear questions across multiple domains and languages, specifically designed to assess LRMs' performance in such tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation of 22 LRMs reveals significant lower efficiency tendencies, with outputs averaging 15.5 times longer than those of traditional small LLMs. Additionally, LRMs often identify correct answers early but continue unnecessary deliberation, with some models even producing numerous errors. These findings highlight the rigid reasoning patterns of current LRMs and underscore the substantial development needed to achieve balanced dual-system thinking capabilities that can adapt appropriately to task complexity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Clinical case reports encode rich, temporal patient trajectories that are often underexploited by traditional machine learning methods relying on structured data. In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings--extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline--serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Just as humans display language patterns influenced by their native tongue when speaking new languages, LLMs often default to English-centric responses even when generating in other languages. Nevertheless, we observe that local cultural information persists within the models and can be readily activated for cultural customization. We first demonstrate that explicitly providing cultural context in prompts significantly improves the models' ability to generate culturally localized responses. We term the disparity in model performance with versus without explicit cultural context the explicit-implicit localization gap, indicating that while cultural knowledge exists within LLMs, it may not naturally surface in multilingual interactions if cultural context is not explicitly provided. Despite the explicit prompting benefit, however, the answers reduce in diversity and tend toward stereotypes. Second, we identify an explicit cultural customization vector, conserved across all non-English languages we explore, which enables LLMs to be steered from the synthetic English cultural world-model toward each non-English cultural world. Steered responses retain the diversity of implicit prompting and reduce stereotypes to dramatically improve the potential for customization. We discuss the implications of explicit cultural customization for understanding the conservation of alternative cultural world models within LLMs, and their controllable utility for translation, cultural customization, and the possibility of making the explicit implicit through soft control for expanded LLM function and appeal.

  Recently, deep reasoning LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1/o3 and DeepSeek-R1) have shown promising performance in various complex tasks. Free translation is an important and interesting task in the multilingual world, which requires going beyond word-for-word translation and taking cultural differences into account. This task is still under-explored in deep reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DeepTrans, a deep reasoning translation model that learns free translation via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we carefully build a reward model with pre-defined scoring criteria on both the translation results and the thought process. Given the source sentences, the reward model teaches the deep translation model how to think and free-translate them during reinforcement learning. In this way, training DeepTrans does not need any labeled translations, avoiding the human-intensive annotation or resource-intensive data synthesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness of DeepTrans. Using Qwen2.5-7B as the backbone, DeepTrans improves performance by 16.3% in literature translation, and outperforms strong deep reasoning baselines as well as baselines that are fine-tuned with synthesized data. Moreover, we summarize the failures and interesting findings during our RL exploration. We hope this work could inspire other researchers in free translation.

  In this paper, we present HalluSearch, a multilingual pipeline designed to detect fabricated text spans in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs. Developed as part of Mu-SHROOM, the Multilingual Shared-task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes, HalluSearch couples retrieval-augmented verification with fine-grained factual splitting to identify and localize hallucinations in fourteen different languages. Empirical evaluations show that HalluSearch performs competitively, placing fourth in both English (within the top ten percent) and Czech.

  Despite the rapid advancement of large language models, they remain highly susceptible to generating hallucinations, which significantly hinders their widespread application. Hallucination research requires dynamic and fine-grained evaluation. However, most existing hallucination benchmarks (especially in Chinese language) rely on human annotations, making automatical and cost-effective hallucination evaluation challenging. To address this, we introduce HaluAgent, an agentic framework that automatically constructs fine-grained QA dataset based on some knowledge documents. Our experiments demonstrate that the manually designed rules and prompt optimization can improve the quality of generated data. Using HaluAgent, we construct C-FAITH, a Chinese QA hallucination benchmark created from 1,399 knowledge documents obtained from web scraping, totaling 60,702 entries. We comprehensively evaluate 16 mainstream LLMs with our proposed C-FAITH, providing detailed experimental results and analysis.

  Hallucination, i.e., generating factually incorrect content, remains a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). We introduce TOHA, a TOpology-based HAllucination detector in the RAG setting, which leverages a topological divergence metric to quantify the structural properties of graphs induced by attention matrices. Examining the topological divergence between prompt and response subgraphs reveals consistent patterns: higher divergence values in specific attention heads correlate with hallucinated outputs, independent of the dataset. Extensive experiments, including evaluation on question answering and data-to-text tasks, show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on several benchmarks, two of which were annotated by us and are being publicly released to facilitate further research. Beyond its strong in-domain performance, TOHA maintains remarkable domain transferability across multiple open-source LLMs. Our findings suggest that analyzing the topological structure of attention matrices can serve as an efficient and robust indicator of factual reliability in LLMs.

  The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have seen substantial advancements through deep thinking. However, these enhancements come with significant resource demands, underscoring the need to explore strategies to train effective reasoning LLMs with far fewer parameters. A critical challenge is that smaller models have different capacities and cognitive trajectories than their larger counterparts. Hence, direct distillation of chain-of-thought (CoT) results from large LLMs to smaller ones can be sometimes ineffective and requires a huge amount of annotated data. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called Critique-Rethink-Verify (CRV), designed for training smaller yet powerful reasoning LLMs. Our CRV framework consists of multiple LLM agents, each specializing in unique abilities: (i) critiquing the CoTs according to the cognitive capabilities of smaller models, (ii) rethinking and refining these CoTs based on the critiques, and (iii) verifying the correctness of the refined results. We further propose the cognitive preference optimization (CogPO) algorithm to enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models by aligning thoughts of these models with their cognitive capacities. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of CRV and CogPO, which outperforms other training methods by a large margin.

  _Jingtian Wu, Claire Cardie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in tasks like question answering and fact verification, they continue to suffer from hallucinations and reasoning errors, especially in multi-hop tasks that require integration of multiple information sources. Current methods address these issues through retrieval-based techniques (grounding reasoning in external evidence), reasoning-based approaches (enhancing coherence via improved prompting), or hybrid strategies combining both elements. One prominent hybrid method, ReAct, has outperformed purely retrieval-based or reasoning-based approaches; however, it lacks internal verification of intermediate reasoning steps, allowing potential errors to propagate through complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce Reasoning Court (RC), a novel framework that extends iterative reasoning-and-retrieval methods, such as ReAct, with a dedicated LLM judge. Unlike ReAct, RC employs this judge to independently evaluate multiple candidate answers and their associated reasoning generated by separate LLM agents. The judge is asked to select the answer that it considers the most factually grounded and logically coherent based on the presented reasoning and evidence, or synthesizes a new answer using available evidence and its pre-trained knowledge if all candidates are inadequate, flawed, or invalid. Evaluations on multi-hop benchmarks (HotpotQA, MuSiQue) and fact-verification (FEVER) demonstrate that RC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot prompting methods without task-specific fine-tuning.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but their development has primarily focused on English and other high-resource languages, leaving many languages underserved. We present our latest Hindi-English bi-lingual LLM \textbf{Mantra-14B} with ~3\% average improvement in benchmark scores over both languages, outperforming models twice its size. Using a curated dataset composed of English and Hindi instruction data of 485K samples, we instruction tuned models such as Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct and Phi-4 to improve performance over both English and Hindi. Our experiments encompassing seven different LLMs of varying parameter sizes and over 140 training attempts with varying English-Hindi training data ratios demonstrated that it is possible to significantly improve multilingual performance without compromising native performance. Further, our approach avoids resource-intensive techniques like vocabulary expansion or architectural modifications, thus keeping the model size small. Our results indicate that modest fine-tuning with culturally and locally informed data can bridge performance gaps without incurring significant computational overhead. We release our training code, datasets, and models under mit and apache licenses to aid further research towards under-represented and low-resource languages.

  The reliance on translated or adapted datasets from English or multilingual resources introduces challenges regarding linguistic and cultural suitability. This study addresses the need for robust and culturally appropriate benchmarks by evaluating the quality of 17 commonly used Turkish benchmark datasets. Using a comprehensive framework that assesses six criteria, both human and LLM-judge annotators provide detailed evaluations to identify dataset strengths and shortcomings.Our results reveal that 70% of the benchmark datasets fail to meet our heuristic quality standards. The correctness of the usage of technical terms is the strongest criterion, but 85% of the criteria are not satisfied in the examined datasets. Although LLM judges demonstrate potential, they are less effective than human annotators, particularly in understanding cultural common sense knowledge and interpreting fluent, unambiguous text. GPT-4o has stronger labeling capabilities for grammatical and technical tasks, while Llama3.3-70B excels at correctness and cultural knowledge evaluation. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for more rigorous quality control in creating and adapting datasets for low-resource languages.

  Despite dramatic recent progress in NLP, it is still a major challenge to apply Large Language Models (LLM) to low-resource languages. This is made visible in benchmarks such as Cross-Lingual Natural Language Inference (XNLI), a key task that demonstrates cross-lingual capabilities of NLP systems across a set of 15 languages. In this paper, we extend the XNLI task for one additional low-resource language, Myanmar, as a proxy challenge for broader low-resource languages, and make three core contributions. First, we build a dataset called Myanmar XNLI (myXNLI) using community crowd-sourced methods, as an extension to the existing XNLI corpus. This involves a two-stage process of community-based construction followed by expert verification; through an analysis, we demonstrate and quantify the value of the expert verification stage in the context of community-based construction for low-resource languages. We make the myXNLI dataset available to the community for future research. Second, we carry out evaluations of recent multilingual language models on the myXNLI benchmark, as well as explore data-augmentation methods to improve model performance. Our data-augmentation methods improve model accuracy by up to 2 percentage points for Myanmar, while uplifting other languages at the same time. Third, we investigate how well these data-augmentation methods generalise to other low-resource languages in the XNLI dataset.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models learn and continually learn through the accumulation of gradient-based updates, but how individual pieces of new information affect existing knowledge, leading to both beneficial generalization and problematic hallucination, remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that when learning new information, LLMs exhibit a "priming" effect: learning a new fact can cause the model to inappropriately apply that knowledge in unrelated contexts. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce "Outlandish," a carefully curated dataset of 1320 diverse text samples designed to probe how new knowledge permeates through an LLM's existing knowledge base. Using this dataset, we show that the degree of priming after learning new information can be predicted by measuring the token probability of key words before learning. This relationship holds robustly across different model architectures (PALM-2, Gemma, Llama), sizes, and training stages. Finally, we develop two novel techniques to modulate how new knowledge affects existing model behavior: (1) a ``stepping-stone'' text augmentation strategy and (2) an ``ignore-k'' update pruning method. These approaches reduce undesirable priming effects by 50-95\% while preserving the model's ability to learn new information. Our findings provide both empirical insights into how LLMs learn and practical tools for improving the specificity of knowledge insertion in language models. Further materials:this https URL

  Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs)has shown remarkable reasoning capabilities in domains such as mathematics and coding, yet their application to clinical diagnosis remains underexplored. Here, we introduce ClinicalGPT-R1, a reasoning enhanced generalist large language model for disease diagnosis. Trained on a dataset of 20,000 real-world clinical records, ClinicalGPT-R1 leverages diverse training strategies to enhance diagnostic reasoning. To benchmark performance, we curated MedBench-Hard, a challenging dataset spanning seven major medical specialties and representative diseases. Experimental results demonstrate that ClinicalGPT-R1 outperforms GPT-4o in Chinese diagnostic tasks and achieves comparable performance to GPT-4 in English settings. This comparative study effectively validates the superior performance of ClinicalGPT-R1 in disease diagnosis tasks. Resources are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with tasks that require a deep understanding of complex questions, especially when faced with long-range dependencies or multi-step reasoning. This work investigates the limitations of current LLMs in question comprehension and identifies three insights: (1) repeating question tokens improves comprehension by increasing attention to question regions, (2) increased backward dependencies negatively affect performance due to unidirectional attentional constraints, and (3) recalibrating attentional mechanisms to prioritize question-relevant regions improves performance.Based on these findings, we first propose a family of prompt-based strategies - Step-by-Step Reading (SSR), SSR+, and SSR++ - that guide LLMs to incrementally process question tokens and align their reasoning with the input structure. These methods significantly improve performance, with SSR++ achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks: 96.66% on GSM8K, 94.61% on ASDiv, and 76.28% on AQuA. Second, we introduce a training-free attention recalibration mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention distributions during inference to emphasize question-relevant regions. This method improves the accuracy of LLaMA 3.1-8B on AQuA by 5.17% without changing model parameters or input prompts.Taken together, our results highlight the importance of structured prompt design and attention optimization in improving LLM comprehension, providing lightweight yet effective tools for improving performance in various NLP tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Given the growing use of generative artificial intelligence as a tool for creating multilingual content and bypassing both machine and traditional translation methods, this study explores the ability of linguistically trained individuals to discern machine-generated output from human-written text (HT). After brief training sessions on the textual anomalies typically found in synthetic text (ST), twenty-three postgraduate translation students analysed excerpts of Italian prose and assigned likelihood scores to indicate whether they believed they were human-written or AI-generated (ChatGPT-4o). The results show that, on average, the students struggled to distinguish between HT and ST, with only two participants achieving notable accuracy. Closer analysis revealed that the students often identified the same textual anomalies in both HT and ST, although features such as low burstiness and self-contradiction were more frequently associated with ST. These findings suggest the need for improvements in the preparatory training. Moreover, the study raises questions about the necessity of editing synthetic text to make it sound more human-like and recommends further research to determine whether AI-generated text is already sufficiently natural-sounding not to require further refinement.

  _Mehmet Arif Demirta≈ü, Claire Zheng, Max Fowler, Kathryn Cunningham_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To complete an open-ended programming exercise, students need to both plan a high-level solution and implement it using the appropriate syntax. However, these problems are often autograded on the correctness of the final submission through test cases, and students cannot get feedback on their planning process. Large language models (LLM) may be able to generate this feedback by detecting the overall code structure even for submissions with syntax errors. To this end, we propose an approach that detects which high-level goals and patterns (i.e. programming plans) exist in a student program with LLMs. We show that both the full GPT-4o model and a small variant (GPT-4o-mini) can detect these plans with remarkable accuracy, outperforming baselines inspired by conventional approaches to code analysis. We further show that the smaller, cost-effective variant (GPT-4o-mini) achieves results on par with state-of-the-art (GPT-4o) after fine-tuning, creating promising implications for smaller models for real-time grading. These smaller models can be incorporated into autograders for open-ended code-writing exercises to provide feedback for students' implicit planning skills, even when their program is syntactically incorrect. Furthermore, LLMs may be useful in providing feedback for problems in other domains where students start with a set of high-level solution steps and iteratively compute the output, such as math and physics problems.

  Speculative decoding is a powerful technique for reducing the latency of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering a fault-tolerant framework that enables the use of highly compressed draft models. In this work, we introduce Self-Distilled Sparse Drafters (SD$^2$), a novel methodology that leverages self-data distillation and fine-grained weight sparsity to produce highly efficient and well-aligned draft models. SD$^2$ systematically enhances draft token acceptance rates while significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate operations (MACs), even in the Universal Assisted Generation (UAG) setting, where draft and target models originate from different model families. On a Llama-3.1-70B target model, SD$^2$ provides a $\times$1.59 higher Mean Accepted Length (MAL) compared to layer-pruned draft models and reduces MACs by over 43.87% with a 8.36% reduction in MAL compared to a dense draft models. Our results highlight the potential of sparsity-aware fine-tuning and compression strategies to improve LLM inference efficiency while maintaining alignment with target models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing complexity of construction management (CM) projects, coupled with challenges such as strict regulatory requirements and labor shortages, requires specialized analytical tools that streamline project workflow and enhance performance. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in general reasoning tasks, their effectiveness in tackling CM-specific challenges, such as precise quantitative analysis and regulatory interpretation, remains inadequately explored. To bridge this gap, this study introduces CMExamSet, a comprehensive benchmarking dataset comprising 689 authentic multiple-choice questions sourced from four nationally accredited CM certification exams. Our zero-shot evaluation assesses overall accuracy, subject areas (e.g., construction safety), reasoning complexity (single-step and multi-step), and question formats (text-only, figure-referenced, and table-referenced). The results indicate that GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 surpass typical human pass thresholds (70%), with average accuracies of 82% and 83%, respectively. Additionally, both models performed better on single-step tasks, with accuracies of 85.7% (GPT-4o) and 86.7% (Claude 3.7). Multi-step tasks were more challenging, reducing performance to 76.5% and 77.6%, respectively. Furthermore, both LLMs show significant limitations on figure-referenced questions, with accuracies dropping to approximately 40%. Our error pattern analysis further reveals that conceptual misunderstandings are the most common (44.4% and 47.9%), underscoring the need for enhanced domain-specific reasoning models. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs as valuable supplementary analytical tools in CM, while highlighting the need for domain-specific refinements and sustained human oversight in complex decision making.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  How do the latent spaces used by independently-trained LLMs relate to one another? We study the nearest neighbor relationships induced by activations at different layers of 24 open-weight LLMs, and find that they 1) tend to vary from layer to layer within a model, and 2) are approximately shared between corresponding layers of different models. Claim 2 shows that these nearest neighbor relationships are not arbitrary, as they are shared across models, but Claim 1 shows that they are not "obvious" either, as there is no single set of nearest neighbor relationships that is universally shared. Together, these suggest that LLMs generate a progression of activation geometries from layer to layer, but that this entire progression is largely shared between models, stretched and squeezed to fit into different architectures.

  Multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmarks are widely used for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their reliability is undermined by benchmark contamination. In this study, we reframe contamination as an inherent aspect of learning and seek to disentangle genuine capability acquisition from superficial memorization in LLM evaluation. First, by analyzing model performance under different memorization conditions, we uncover a counterintuitive trend: LLMs perform worse on memorized MCQs than on non-memorized ones, indicating the coexistence of two distinct learning phenomena, i.e., rote memorization and genuine capability learning. To disentangle them, we propose TrinEval, a novel evaluation framework that reformulates MCQs into an alternative trinity format, reducing memorization while preserving knowledge assessment. Experiments validate TrinEval's effectiveness in reformulation, and its evaluation reveals that common LLMs may memorize by rote 20.5% of knowledge points (in MMLU on average).

  As the prevalence of mental health crises increases on social media platforms, identifying and preventing potential harm has become an urgent challenge. This study introduces a large language model (LLM)-based text transfer recognition method for social network crisis intervention, enhanced with domain-specific mental health knowledge. We propose a multi-level framework that incorporates transfer learning using BERT, and integrates mental health knowledge, sentiment analysis, and behavior prediction techniques. The framework includes a crisis annotation tool trained on social media datasets from real-world events, enabling the model to detect nuanced emotional cues and identify psychological crises. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional models in crisis detection accuracy and exhibits greater sensitivity to subtle emotional and contextual variations.

  Studies on evaluation metrics and LLM-as-a-Judge models for automatic text summarization have largely been focused on English, limiting our understanding of their effectiveness in other languages. Through our new dataset BASSE (BAsque and Spanish Summarization Evaluation), we address this situation by collecting human judgments on 2,040 abstractive summaries in Basque and Spanish, generated either manually or by five LLMs with four different prompts. For each summary, annotators evaluated five criteria on a 5-point Likert scale: coherence, consistency, fluency, relevance, and 5W1H. We use these data to reevaluate traditional automatic metrics used for evaluating summaries, as well as several LLM-as-a-Judge models that show strong performance on this task in English. Our results show that currently proprietary judge LLMs have the highest correlation with human judgments, followed by criteria-specific automatic metrics, while open-sourced judge LLMs perform poorly. We release BASSE and our code publicly, along with the first large-scale Basque summarization dataset containing 22,525 news articles with their subheads.

  Prompt-tuning (PT) for large language models (LLMs) can facilitate the performance on various conventional NLP tasks with significantly fewer trainable parameters. However, our investigation reveals that PT provides limited improvement and may even degrade the primitive performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks. Such a phenomenon suggests that soft prompts can positively impact certain instances while negatively affecting others, particularly during the later phases of reasoning. To address these challenges, We first identify an information accumulation within the soft prompts. Through detailed analysis, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is often accompanied by erroneous information flow patterns in the deeper layers of the model, which ultimately lead to incorrect reasoning outcomes. we propose a novel method called Dynamic Prompt Corruption (DPC) to take better advantage of soft prompts in complex reasoning tasks, which dynamically adjusts the influence of soft prompts based on their impact on the reasoning process. Specifically, DPC consists of two stages: Dynamic Trigger and Dynamic Corruption. First, Dynamic Trigger measures the impact of soft prompts, identifying whether beneficial or detrimental. Then, Dynamic Corruption mitigates the negative effects of soft prompts by selectively masking key tokens that interfere with the reasoning process. We validate the proposed approach through extensive experiments on various LLMs and reasoning tasks, including GSM8K, MATH, and AQuA. Experimental results demonstrate that DPC can consistently enhance the performance of PT, achieving 4%-8% accuracy gains compared to vanilla prompt tuning, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach and its potential to enhance complex reasoning in LLMs.

  Graphs are able to model interconnected entities in many online services, supporting a wide range of applications on the Web. This raises an important question: How can we train a graph foundational model on multiple source domains and adapt to an unseen target domain? A major obstacle is that graphs from different domains often exhibit divergent characteristics. Some studies leverage large language models to align multiple domains based on textual descriptions associated with the graphs, limiting their applicability to text-attributed graphs. For text-free graphs, a few recent works attempt to align different feature distributions across domains, while generally neglecting structural differences. In this work, we propose a novel Structure Alignment framework for text-free Multi-domain Graph Pre-Training and cross-domain adaptation (SAMGPT). It is designed to learn multi-domain knowledge from graphs originating in multiple source domains, which can then be adapted to address applications in an unseen target domain. Specifically, we introduce a set of structure tokens to harmonize structure-based aggregation across source domains during the pre-training phase. Next, for cross-domain adaptation, we design dual prompts, namely, holistic prompts and specific prompts, which adapt unified multi-domain structural knowledge and fine-grained, domain-specific information, respectively, to a target domain. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of SAMGPT.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained unprecedented prominence, achieving widespread adoption across diverse domains and integrating deeply into society. The capability to fine-tune general-purpose LLMs, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), for specific tasks has facilitated the emergence of numerous Custom GPTs. These tailored models are increasingly made available through dedicated marketplaces, such as OpenAI's GPT Store. However, their black-box nature introduces significant safety and compliance risks. In this work, we present a scalable framework for the automated evaluation of Custom GPTs against OpenAI's usage policies, which define the permissible behaviors of these systems. Our framework integrates three core components: (1) automated discovery and data collection of models from the GPT store, (2) a red-teaming prompt generator tailored to specific policy categories and the characteristics of each target GPT, and (3) an LLM-as-a-judge technique to analyze each prompt-response pair for potential policy violations. We validate our framework with a manually annotated ground truth, and evaluate it through a large-scale study with 782 Custom GPTs across three categories: Romantic, Cybersecurity, and Academic GPTs. Our manual annotation process achieved an F1 score of 0.975 in identifying policy violations, confirming the reliability of the framework's assessments. The results reveal that 58.7% of the analyzed models exhibit indications of non-compliance, exposing weaknesses in the GPT store's review and approval processes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that a model's popularity does not correlate with compliance, and non-compliance issues largely stem from behaviors inherited from base models rather than user-driven customizations. We believe this approach is extendable to other chatbot platforms and policy domains, improving LLM-based systems safety.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tokenization is a necessary component within the current architecture of many language models, including the transformer-based large language models (LLMs) of Generative AI, yet its impact on the model's cognition is often overlooked. We argue that LLMs demonstrate that the Distributional Hypothesis (DH) is sufficient for reasonably human-like language performance, and that the emergence of human-meaningful linguistic units among tokens and current structural constraints motivate changes to existing, linguistically-agnostic tokenization techniques, particularly with respect to their roles as (1) semantic primitives and as (2) vehicles for conveying salient distributional patterns from human language to the model. We explore tokenizations from a BPE tokenizer; extant model vocabularies obtained from Hugging Face and tiktoken; and the information in exemplar token vectors as they move through the layers of a RoBERTa (large) model. Besides creating sub-optimal semantic building blocks and obscuring the model's access to the necessary distributional patterns, we describe how tokens and pretraining can act as a backdoor for bias and other unwanted content, which current alignment practices may not remediate. Additionally, we relay evidence that the tokenization algorithm's objective function impacts the LLM's cognition, despite being arguably meaningfully insulated from the main system intelligence.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite being empowered with alignment mechanisms, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to emerging jailbreak attacks that can compromise their alignment mechanisms. This vulnerability poses significant risks to real-world applications. Existing work faces challenges in both training efficiency and generalization capabilities (i.e., Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Red-Teaming). Developing effective strategies to enable LLMs to resist continuously evolving jailbreak attempts represents a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel defensive paradigm called GuidelineLLM, which assists LLMs in recognizing queries that may have harmful content. Before LLMs respond to a query, GuidelineLLM first identifies potential risks associated with the query, summarizes these risks into guideline suggestions, and then feeds these guidelines to the responding LLMs. Importantly, our approach eliminates the necessity for additional safety fine-tuning of the LLMs themselves; only the GuidelineLLM requires fine-tuning. This characteristic enhances the general applicability of GuidelineLLM across various LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that GuidelineLLM can significantly reduce the attack success rate (ASR) against LLM (an average reduction of 34.17\% ASR) while maintaining the usefulness of LLM in handling benign queries.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in helping with numerous medical challenges. Deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications such as medicine, however, brings in many concerns. One major area of concern relates to biased behaviors of LLMs in medical applications, leading to unfair treatment of individuals. To pave the way for the responsible and impactful deployment of Med LLMs, rigorous evaluation is a key prerequisite. Due to the huge complexity and variability of different medical scenarios, existing work in this domain has primarily relied on using manually crafted datasets for bias evaluation. In this study, we present a new method to scale up such bias evaluations by automatically generating test cases based on rigorous medical evidence. We specifically target the challenges of a) domain-specificity of bias characterization, b) hallucinating while generating the test cases, and c) various dependencies between the health outcomes and sensitive attributes. To that end, we offer new methods to address these challenges integrated with our generative pipeline, using medical knowledge graphs, medical ontologies, and customized general LLM evaluation frameworks in our method. Through a series of extensive experiments, we show that the test cases generated by our proposed method can effectively reveal bias patterns in Med LLMs at larger and more flexible scales than human-crafted datasets. We publish a large bias evaluation dataset using our pipeline, which is dedicated to a few medical case studies. A live demo of our application for vignette generation is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper examines the role of cognitive biases in the decision-making processes of large language models (LLMs), challenging the conventional goal of eliminating all biases. When properly balanced, we show that certain cognitive biases can enhance decision-making efficiency through rational deviations and heuristic shortcuts. By introducing heuristic moderation and an abstention option, which allows LLMs to withhold responses when uncertain, we reduce error rates, improve decision accuracy, and optimize decision rates. Using the Balance Rigor and Utility (BRU) dataset, developed through expert collaboration, our findings demonstrate that targeted inspection of cognitive biases aligns LLM decisions more closely with human reasoning, enhancing reliability and suggesting strategies for future improvements. This approach offers a novel way to leverage cognitive biases to improve the practical utility of LLMs across various applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mitigating hallucination issues is a key challenge that must be overcome to reliably deploy large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios. Recently, various methods have been proposed to detect and revise factual errors in LLM-generated texts, in order to reduce hallucination. In this paper, we propose Re-Ex, a method for post-editing LLM-generated responses. Re-Ex introduces a novel reasoning step dubbed as the factual error explanation step. Re-Ex revises the initial response of LLMs using 3-steps : first, external tools are used to retrieve the evidences of the factual errors in the initial LLM response; next, LLM is instructed to explain the problematic parts of the response based on the gathered evidence; finally, LLM revises the initial response using the explanations provided in the previous step. In addition to the explanation step, Re-Ex also incorporates new prompting techniques to reduce the token count and inference time required for the response revision process. Compared with existing methods including FacTool, CoVE, and RARR, Re-Ex provides better detection and revision performance with less inference time and fewer tokens in multiple benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language tasks, but their inference incurs substantial computational and memory overhead. To improve efficiency, parallel decoding methods like Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT) decompose prompts into sub-problems for concurrent processing. However, these methods significantly compromise answer quality by treating semantically linked sub-problems as independent. We propose Plato, a novel approach that co-designs algorithms and systems for semantic-aware parallel decoding. Plato leverages LLMs to organize sub-problems into a dependency graph based on logical and causal relationships, enabling concurrent decoding of non-dependent nodes while preserving answer coherence and quality. To further enhance efficiency, Plato pipelines planning and node decoding stages, implements a global context cache, and carefully structures node inference prompts to maximize key-value cache reuse and minimize overhead. Our evaluations show that Plato improves throughput by 68% over autoregressive decoding while achieving a 40% net win rate in answer quality. Compared to SoT, Plato demonstrates a remarkable 90% quality net-win rate. Ablation studies reveal that our pipeline design improves speedup by 29%, while our KV cache reuse optimization reduces overhead by 75%.

  With the release of the o1 model by OpenAI, reasoning models adopting slow thinking strategies have gradually emerged. As the responses generated by such models often include complex reasoning, intermediate steps, and self-reflection, existing evaluation methods are often inadequate. They struggle to determine whether the LLM output is truly equivalent to the reference answer, and also have difficulty identifying and extracting the final answer from long, complex responses. To address this issue, we propose xVerify, an efficient answer verifier for reasoning model evaluations. xVerify demonstrates strong capability in equivalence judgment, enabling it to effectively determine whether the answers produced by reasoning models are equivalent to reference answers across various types of objective questions. To train and evaluate xVerify, we construct the VAR dataset by collecting question-answer pairs generated by multiple LLMs across various datasets, leveraging multiple reasoning models and challenging evaluation sets designed specifically for reasoning model assessment. A multi-round annotation process is employed to ensure label accuracy. Based on the VAR dataset, we train multiple xVerify models of different scales. In evaluation experiments conducted on both the test set and generalization set, all xVerify models achieve overall F1 scores and accuracy exceeding 95\%. Notably, the smallest variant, xVerify-0.5B-I, outperforms all evaluation methods except GPT-4o, while xVerify-3B-Ib surpasses GPT-4o in overall performance. These results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of xVerify.

  Checkboxes are critical in real-world document processing where the presence or absence of ticks directly informs data extraction and decision-making processes. Yet, despite the strong performance of Large Vision and Language Models across a wide range of tasks, they struggle with interpreting checkable content. This challenge becomes particularly pressing in industries where a single overlooked checkbox may lead to costly regulatory or contractual oversights. To address this gap, we introduce the CheckboxQA dataset, a targeted resource designed to evaluate and improve model performance on checkbox-related tasks.

  Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for assisting clinical interviews due to their fluent interactive capabilities and extensive medical knowledge. However, the lack of high-quality interview dialogue data and widely accepted evaluation methods has significantly impeded this process. So we propose CliniChat, a framework that integrates multi-source knowledge to enable LLMs to simulate real-world clinical interviews. It consists of two modules: Clini-Recon and Clini-Eval, each responsible for reconstructing and evaluating interview dialogues, respectively. By incorporating three sources of knowledge, Clini-Recon transforms clinical notes into systematic, professional, and empathetic interview dialogues. Clini-Eval combines a comprehensive evaluation metric system with a two-phase automatic evaluation approach, enabling LLMs to assess interview performance like experts. We contribute MedQA-Dialog, a high-quality synthetic interview dialogue dataset, and CliniChatGLM, a model specialized for clinical interviews. Experimental results demonstrate that CliniChatGLM's interview capabilities undergo a comprehensive upgrade, particularly in history-taking, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Crafting a marketing message (copy), or copywriting is a challenging generation task, as the copy must adhere to various constraints. Copy creation is inherently iterative for humans, starting with an initial draft followed by successive refinements. However, manual copy creation is time-consuming and expensive, resulting in only a few copies for each use case. This limitation restricts our ability to personalize content to customers. Contrary to the manual approach, LLMs can generate copies quickly, but the generated content does not consistently meet all the constraints on the first attempt (similar to humans). While recent studies have shown promise in improving constrained generation through iterative refinement, they have primarily addressed tasks with only a few simple constraints. Consequently, the effectiveness of iterative refinement for tasks such as copy generation, which involves many intricate constraints, remains unclear. To address this gap, we propose an LLM-based end-to-end framework for scalable copy generation using iterative refinement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address multiple challenging constraints simultaneously in copy generation. Examples of these constraints include length, topics, keywords, preferred lexical ordering, and tone of voice. We demonstrate the performance of our framework by creating copies for e-commerce banners for three different use cases of varying complexity. Our results show that iterative refinement increases the copy success rate by $16.25-35.91$% across use cases. Furthermore, the copies generated using our approach outperformed manually created content in multiple pilot studies using a multi-armed bandit framework. The winning copy improved the click-through rate by $38.5-45.21$%.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present MultiLoKo, a new benchmark for evaluating multilinguality in LLMs covering 31 languages. MultiLoKo consists of three partitions: a main partition consisting of 500 questions per language, separately sourced to be locally relevant to the specific language, and two translated partitions, containing human-authored translations from 30 non-English languages to English and vice versa. For comparison, we also release corresponding machine-authored translations. The data is equally distributed over two splits: a dev split and a blind, out-of-distribution test split. MultiLoKo can be used to study a variety of questions regarding the multilinguality of LLMs as well as meta-questions about multilingual benchmark creation. We compute MultiLoKo scores for 11 base and chat models marketed to be multilingual and study their average performance, their performance parity across languages, how much their ability to answer questions depends on the question language, and which languages are most difficult. None of the models we studied performs well on MultiLoKo, as indicated by low average scores as well as large differences between the best and worst scoring languages. Furthermore, we find a substantial effect of the question language, indicating sub-optimal knowledge transfer between languages. Lastly, we find that using local vs English-translated data can result in differences more than 20 points for the best performing models, drastically change the estimated difficulty of some languages. For using machines instead of human translations, we find a weaker effect on ordering of language difficulty, a larger difference in model rankings, and a substantial drop in estimated performance for all models.

  Current multimodal benchmarks often conflate reasoning with domain-specific knowledge, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate general reasoning abilities in non-expert settings. To address this, we introduce VisualPuzzles, a benchmark that targets visual reasoning while deliberately minimizing reliance on specialized knowledge. VisualPuzzles consists of diverse questions spanning five categories: algorithmic, analogical, deductive, inductive, and spatial reasoning. One major source of our questions is manually translated logical reasoning questions from the Chinese Civil Service Examination. Experiments show that VisualPuzzles requires significantly less intensive domain-specific knowledge and more complex reasoning compared to benchmarks like MMMU, enabling us to better evaluate genuine multimodal reasoning. Evaluations show that state-of-the-art multimodal large language models consistently lag behind human performance on VisualPuzzles, and that strong performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks does not necessarily translate to success on reasoning-focused, knowledge-light tasks. Additionally, reasoning enhancements such as scaling up inference compute (with "thinking" modes) yield inconsistent gains across models and task types, and we observe no clear correlation between model size and performance. We also found that models exhibit different reasoning and answering patterns on VisualPuzzles compared to benchmarks with heavier emphasis on knowledge. VisualPuzzles offers a clearer lens through which to evaluate reasoning capabilities beyond factual recall and domain knowledge.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tokenization is a crucial step in NLP, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs), impacting downstream performance, computational cost, and efficiency. Existing LLMs rely on the classical Byte-pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm for subword tokenization that greedily merges frequent character bigrams. This often leads to segmentation that does not align with linguistically meaningful units. To address this, we propose morphology-aware segmentation as a pre-tokenization step prior to applying BPE. To facilitate morphology-aware segmentation, we create a novel dataset for Hindi and Marathi, incorporating sandhi splitting to enhance the subword tokenization. Experiments on downstream tasks show that morphologically grounded tokenization improves performance for machine translation and language modeling. Additionally, to handle the ambiguity in the Unicode characters for diacritics, particularly dependent vowels in syllable-based writing systems, we introduce Constrained BPE (CBPE), an extension to the traditional BPE algorithm that incorporates script-specific constraints. Specifically, CBPE handles dependent vowels. Our results show that CBPE achieves a 1.68\% reduction in fertility scores while maintaining comparable or improved downstream performance in machine translation, offering a computationally efficient alternative to standard BPE. Moreover, to evaluate segmentation across different tokenization algorithms, we introduce a new human evaluation metric, \textit{EvalTok}, enabling more human-grounded assessment.

  Literature review tables are essential for summarizing and comparing collections of scientific papers. We explore the task of generating tables that best fulfill a user's informational needs given a collection of scientific papers. Building on recent work (Newman et al., 2024), we extend prior approaches to address real-world complexities through a combination of LLM-based methods and human annotations. Our contributions focus on three key challenges encountered in real-world use: (i) User prompts are often under-specified; (ii) Retrieved candidate papers frequently contain irrelevant content; and (iii) Task evaluation should move beyond shallow text similarity techniques and instead assess the utility of inferred tables for information-seeking tasks (e.g., comparing papers). To support reproducible evaluation, we introduce ARXIV2TABLE, a more realistic and challenging benchmark for this task, along with a novel approach to improve literature review table generation in real-world scenarios. Our extensive experiments on this benchmark show that both open-weight and proprietary LLMs struggle with the task, highlighting its difficulty and the need for further advancements.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities to generate responses that exhibit consistent personality traits. Despite the major attempts to analyze personality expression through output-based evaluations, little is known about how such traits are internally encoded within LLM parameters. In this paper, we introduce a layer-wise probing framework to systematically investigate the layer-wise capability of LLMs in encoding personality for responding. We conduct probing experiments on 11 open-source LLMs over the PersonalityEdit benchmark and find that LLMs predominantly encode personality for responding in their middle and upper layers, with instruction-tuned models demonstrating a slightly clearer separation of personality traits. Furthermore, by interpreting the trained probing hyperplane as a layer-wise boundary for each personality category, we propose a layer-wise perturbation method to edit the personality expressed by LLMs during inference. Our results show that even when the prompt explicitly specifies a particular personality, our method can still successfully alter the response personality of LLMs. Interestingly, the difficulty of converting between certain personality traits varies substantially, which aligns with the representational distances in our probing experiments. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive MMLU benchmark evaluation and time overhead analysis, demonstrating that our proposed personality editing method incurs only minimal degradation in general capabilities while maintaining low training costs and acceptable inference latency.

  Dynamic Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has shown great success in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) during generation. However, existing dynamic RAG methods face significant limitations in two key aspects: 1) Lack of an effective mechanism to control retrieval triggers, and 2) Lack of effective scrutiny of retrieval content. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative dynamic RAG method, DioR (Adaptive Cognitive Detection and Contextual Retrieval Optimization), which consists of two main components: adaptive cognitive detection and contextual retrieval optimization, specifically designed to determine when retrieval is needed and what to retrieve for LLMs is useful. Experimental results demonstrate that DioR achieves superior performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our work.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming data analytics, but their widespread adoption is hindered by two critical limitations: they are not explainable (opaque reasoning processes) and not verifiable (prone to hallucinations and unchecked errors). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves accuracy by grounding LLMs in external data, it fails to address the core challenges of trustworthy analytics - especially when processing noisy, inconsistent, or multi-modal data (for example, text, tables, images). We propose DataMosaic, a framework designed to make LLM-powered analytics both explainable and verifiable. By dynamically extracting task-specific structures (for example, tables, graphs, trees) from raw data, DataMosaic provides transparent, step-by-step reasoning traces and enables validation of intermediate results. Built on a multi-agent framework, DataMosaic orchestrates self-adaptive agents that align with downstream task requirements, enhancing consistency, completeness, and privacy. Through this approach, DataMosaic not only tackles the limitations of current LLM-powered analytics systems but also lays the groundwork for a new paradigm of grounded, accurate, and explainable multi-modal data analytics.

  Stance detection has become an essential tool for analyzing public discussions on social media. Current methods face significant challenges, particularly in Chinese language processing and multi-turn conversational analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce C-MTCSD, the largest Chinese multi-turn conversational stance detection dataset, comprising 24,264 carefully annotated instances from Sina Weibo, which is 4.2 times larger than the only prior Chinese conversational stance detection dataset. Our comprehensive evaluation using both traditional approaches and large language models reveals the complexity of C-MTCSD: even state-of-the-art models achieve only 64.07% F1 score in the challenging zero-shot setting, while performance consistently degrades with increasing conversation depth. Traditional models particularly struggle with implicit stance detection, achieving below 50% F1 score. This work establishes a challenging new benchmark for Chinese stance detection research, highlighting significant opportunities for future improvements.

  The limited reasoning capabilities of small language models (SLMs) cast doubt on their suitability for tasks demanding deep, multi-step logical deduction. This paper introduces a framework called Small Reasons, Large Hints (SMART), which selectively augments SLM reasoning with targeted guidance from large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the concept of cognitive scaffolding, SMART employs a score-based evaluation to identify uncertain reasoning steps and injects corrective LLM-generated reasoning only when necessary. By framing structured reasoning as an optimal policy search, our approach steers the reasoning trajectory toward correct solutions without exhaustive sampling. Our experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that targeted external scaffolding significantly improves performance, paving the way for collaborative use of both SLM and LLM to tackle complex reasoning tasks that are currently unsolvable by SLMs alone.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising technique for applying LLMs to proprietary domains. However, retrieved documents may contain sensitive knowledge, posing risks of privacy leakage in generative results. Thus, effectively erasing private information from retrieved documents is a key challenge for RAG. Unlike traditional text anonymization, RAG should consider: (1) the inherent multi-document reasoning may face de-anonymization attacks; (2) private knowledge varies by scenarios, so users should be allowed to customize which information to erase; (3) preserving sufficient publicly available knowledge for generation tasks. This paper introduces the privacy erasure task for RAG and proposes Eraser4RAG, a private knowledge eraser which effectively removes user-defined private knowledge from documents while preserving sufficient public knowledge for generation. Specifically, we first construct a global knowledge graph to identify potential knowledge across documents, aiming to defend against de-anonymization attacks. Then we randomly split it into private and public sub-graphs, and fine-tune Flan-T5 to rewrite the retrieved documents excluding private triples. Finally, PPO algorithm optimizes the rewriting model to minimize private triples and maximize public triples retention. Experiments on four QA datasets demonstrate that Eraser4RAG achieves superior erase performance than GPT-4o.

  Legal writing demands clarity, formality, and domain-specific precision-qualities often lacking in documents authored by individuals without legal training. To bridge this gap, this paper explores the task of legal text refinement that transforms informal, conversational inputs into persuasive legal arguments. We introduce FinDR, a Chinese dataset of financial dispute records, annotated with official judgments on claim reasonableness. Our proposed method, Multi-Scale Model Interaction (MSMI), leverages a lightweight classifier to evaluate outputs and guide iterative refinement by Large Language Models (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that MSMI significantly outperforms single-pass prompting strategies. Additionally, we validate the generalizability of MSMI on several short-text benchmarks, showing improved adversarial robustness. Our findings reveal the potential of multi-model collaboration for enhancing legal document generation and broader text refinement tasks.

  Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) that enables the extraction of meaningful insights from textual data, particularly from dynamic platforms like Twitter and IMDB. This study explores a hybrid framework combining transformer-based models, specifically BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, XLNet, and DistilBERT, to improve sentiment classification accuracy and robustness. The framework addresses challenges such as noisy data, contextual ambiguity, and generalization across diverse datasets by leveraging the unique strengths of these models. BERT captures bidirectional context, GPT-2 enhances generative capabilities, RoBERTa optimizes contextual understanding with larger corpora and dynamic masking, XLNet models dependency through permutation-based learning, and DistilBERT offers efficiency with reduced computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy. We demonstrate text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction using Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Bag of Words (BoW), ensure high-quality input data for the models. The hybrid approach was evaluated on benchmark datasets Sentiment140 and IMDB, achieving superior accuracy rates of 94\% and 95\%, respectively, outperforming standalone models. The results validate the effectiveness of combining multiple transformer models in ensemble-like setups to address the limitations of individual architectures. This research highlights its applicability to real-world tasks such as social media monitoring, customer sentiment analysis, and public opinion tracking which offers a pathway for future advancements in hybrid NLP frameworks.

  _Michael Kamerath, Aniello De Santo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper leverages past sentence processing studies to investigate whether monolingual and multilingual LLMs show human-like preferences when presented with examples of relative clause attachment ambiguities in Italian and English. Furthermore, we test whether these preferences can be modulated by lexical factors (the type of verb/noun in the matrix clause) which have been shown to be tied to subtle constraints on syntactic and semantic relations. Our results overall showcase how LLM behavior varies interestingly across models, but also general failings of these models in correctly capturing human-like preferences. In light of these results, we argue that RC attachment is the ideal benchmark for cross-linguistic investigations of LLMs' linguistic knowledge and biases.

  In the realm of large language model (LLM), as the size of large models increases, it also brings higher training costs. There is a urgent need to minimize the data size in LLM training. Compared with data selection method, the data distillation method aims to synthesize a small number of data samples to achieve the training effect of the full data set and has better flexibility. Despite its successes in computer vision, the discreteness of text data has hitherto stymied its exploration in natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we proposed a method that involves learning pseudo prompt data based on trajectory matching and finding its nearest neighbor ID to achieve cross-architecture transfer. During the distillation process, we introduce a regularization loss to improve the robustness of our distilled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first data distillation work suitable for text generation tasks such as instruction tuning. Evaluations on two benchmarks, including ARC-Easy and MMLU instruction tuning datasets, established the superiority of our distillation approach over the SOTA data selection method LESS. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a good transferability over LLM structures (i.e., OPT to Llama).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study addresses the challenge of ambiguity in knowledge graph question answering (KGQA). While recent KGQA systems have made significant progress, particularly with the integration of large language models (LLMs), they typically assume user queries are unambiguous, which is an assumption that rarely holds in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that dynamically handles both entity ambiguity (e.g., distinguishing between entities with similar names) and intent ambiguity (e.g., clarifying different interpretations of user queries) through interactive clarification. Our approach employs a Bayesian inference mechanism to quantify query ambiguity and guide LLMs in determining when and how to request clarification from users within a multi-turn dialogue framework. We further develop a two-agent interaction framework where an LLM-based user simulator enables iterative refinement of logical forms through simulated user feedback. Experimental results on the WebQSP and CWQ dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance by effectively resolving semantic ambiguities. Additionally, we contribute a refined dataset of disambiguated queries, derived from interaction histories, to facilitate future research in this direction.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o1, have demonstrated the significant effectiveness of test-time scaling, achieving substantial performance gains across various benchmarks. These advanced models utilize deliberate "thinking" steps to systematically enhance answer quality. In this paper, we propose leveraging these high-quality outputs generated by reasoning-intensive models to improve less computationally demanding, non-reasoning models. We explore and compare methodologies for utilizing the answers produced by reasoning models to train and improve non-reasoning models. Through straightforward Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) experiments on established benchmarks, we demonstrate consistent improvements across various benchmarks, underscoring the potential of this approach for advancing the ability of models to answer questions directly.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent years have witnessed significant progress in large language models' (LLMs) reasoning, which is largely due to the chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, allowing models to generate intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. Building on these advances, state-of-the-art LLMs are instruction-tuned to provide long and detailed CoT pathways when responding to reasoning-related questions. However, human beings are naturally cognitive misers and will prompt language models to give rather short responses, thus raising a significant conflict with CoT reasoning. In this paper, we delve into how LLMs' reasoning performance changes when users provide short-path prompts. The results and analysis reveal that language models can reason effectively and robustly without explicit CoT prompts, while under short-path prompting, LLMs' reasoning ability drops significantly and becomes unstable, even on grade-school problems. To address this issue, we propose two approaches: an instruction-guided approach and a fine-tuning approach, both designed to effectively manage the conflict. Experimental results show that both methods achieve high accuracy, providing insights into the trade-off between instruction adherence and reasoning accuracy in current models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When the complete source sentence is provided, Large Language Models (LLMs) perform excellently in offline machine translation even with a simple prompt "Translate the following sentence from [src lang] into [tgt lang]:". However, in many real scenarios, the source tokens arrive in a streaming manner and simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) is required, then the efficiency and performance of decoder-only LLMs are significantly limited by their auto-regressive nature. To enable LLMs to achieve high-quality SiMT as efficiently as offline translation, we propose a novel paradigm that includes constructing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data for SiMT, along with new training and inference strategies. To replicate the token input/output stream in SiMT, the source and target tokens are rearranged into an interleaved sequence, separated by special tokens according to varying latency requirements. This enables powerful LLMs to learn read and write operations adaptively, based on varying latency prompts, while still maintaining efficient auto-regressive decoding. Experimental results show that, even with limited SFT data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various SiMT benchmarks, and preserves the original abilities of offline translation. Moreover, our approach generalizes well to document-level SiMT setting without requiring specific fine-tuning, even beyond the offline translation model.

  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning of large language models (LLMs) by decomposing problems into sequential steps, mimicking human logic and reducing errors. However, complex tasks with vast solution spaces and vague constraints often exceed the capacity of a single reasoning chain. Inspired by Minimal Free Resolution (MFR) in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, we propose Syzygy of Thoughts (SoT)-a novel framework that extends CoT by introducing auxiliary, interrelated reasoning paths. SoT captures deeper logical dependencies, enabling more robust and structured problem-solving. MFR decomposes a module into a sequence of free modules with minimal rank, providing a structured analytical approach to complex systems. This method introduces the concepts of "Module", "Betti numbers","Freeness", "Mapping", "Exactness" and "Minimality", enabling the systematic decomposition of the original complex problem into logically complete minimal subproblems while preserving key problem features and reducing reasoning length. We tested SoT across diverse datasets (e.g., GSM8K, MATH) and models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2.5), achieving inference accuracy that matches or surpasses mainstream CoTs standards. Additionally, by aligning the sampling process with algebraic constraints, our approach enhances the scalability of inference time in LLMs, ensuring both transparent reasoning and high performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When applying pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to address anomaly detection tasks, the multivariate time series (MTS) modality of anomaly detection does not align with the text modality of LLMs. Existing methods simply transform the MTS data into multiple univariate time series sequences, which can cause many problems. This paper introduces MADLLM, a novel multivariate anomaly detection method via pre-trained LLMs. We design a new triple encoding technique to align the MTS modality with the text modality of LLMs. Specifically, this technique integrates the traditional patch embedding method with two novel embedding approaches: Skip Embedding, which alters the order of patch processing in traditional methods to help LLMs retain knowledge of previous features, and Feature Embedding, which leverages contrastive learning to allow the model to better understand the correlations between different features. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various public anomaly detection datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The capabilities of the latest large language models (LLMs) have been extended from pure natural language understanding to complex reasoning tasks. However, current reasoning models often exhibit factual inaccuracies in longer reasoning chains, which poses challenges for historical reasoning and limits the potential of LLMs in complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. Historical studies require not only the accurate presentation of factual information but also the ability to establish cross-temporal correlations and derive coherent conclusions from fragmentary and often ambiguous sources. To address these challenges, we propose Kongzi, a large language model specifically designed for historical analysis. Through the integration of curated, high-quality historical data and a novel fact-reinforcement learning strategy, Kongzi demonstrates strong factual alignment and sophisticated reasoning depth. Extensive experiments on tasks such as historical question answering and narrative generation demonstrate that Kongzi outperforms existing models in both factual accuracy and reasoning depth. By effectively addressing the unique challenges inherent in historical texts, Kongzi sets a new standard for the development of accurate and reliable LLMs in professional domains.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current safety alignment techniques for large language models (LLMs) face two key challenges: (1) under-generalization, which leaves models vulnerable to novel jailbreak attacks, and (2) over-alignment, which leads to the excessive refusal of benign instructions. Our preliminary investigation reveals semantic overlap between jailbreak/harmful queries and normal prompts in embedding space, suggesting that more effective safety alignment requires a deeper semantic understanding. This motivates us to incorporate safety-policy-driven reasoning into the alignment process. To this end, we propose the Safety-oriented Reasoning Optimization Framework (SaRO), which consists of two stages: (1) Reasoning-style Warmup (RW) that enables LLMs to internalize long-chain reasoning through supervised fine-tuning, and (2) Safety-oriented Reasoning Process Optimization (SRPO) that promotes safety reflection via direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SaRO over traditional alignment methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the successes of language models, their evaluation remains a daunting challenge for new and existing tasks. We consider the task of text simplification, commonly used to improve information accessibility, where evaluation faces two major challenges. First, the data in existing benchmarks might not reflect the capabilities of current language models on the task, often containing disfluent, incoherent, or simplistic examples. Second, existing human ratings associated with the benchmarks often contain a high degree of disagreement, resulting in inconsistent ratings; nevertheless, existing metrics still have to show higher correlations with these imperfect ratings. As a result, evaluation for the task is not reliable and does not reflect expected trends (e.g., more powerful models being assigned higher scores). We address these challenges for the task of text simplification through three contributions. First, we introduce SynthSimpliEval, a synthetic benchmark for text simplification featuring simplified sentences generated by models of varying sizes. Through a pilot study, we show that human ratings on our benchmark exhibit high inter-annotator agreement and reflect the expected trend: larger models produce higher-quality simplifications. Second, we show that auto-evaluation with a panel of LLM judges (LLMs-as-a-jury) often suffices to obtain consistent ratings for the evaluation of text simplification. Third, we demonstrate that existing learnable metrics for text simplification benefit from training on our LLMs-as-a-jury-rated synthetic data, closing the gap with pure LLMs-as-a-jury for evaluation. Overall, through our case study on text simplification, we show that a reliable evaluation requires higher quality test data, which could be obtained through synthetic data and LLMs-as-a-jury ratings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for ideation and scientific discovery, it is important to evaluate their ability to generate novel output. Prior work evaluates novelty as the originality with respect to training data, but original outputs can be low quality. In contrast, non-expert judges may favor high-quality but memorized outputs, limiting the reliability of human preference as a metric. We propose a new novelty metric for LLM generations that balances originality and quality -- the harmonic mean of the fraction of \ngrams unseen during training and a task-specific quality score. We evaluate the novelty of generations from two families of open-data models (OLMo and Pythia) on three creative tasks: story completion, poetry writing, and creative tool use. We find that LLM generated text is less novel than human written text. To elicit more novel outputs, we experiment with various inference-time methods, which reveals a trade-off between originality and quality. While these methods can boost novelty, they do so by increasing originality at the expense of quality. In contrast, increasing model size or applying post-training reliably shifts the Pareto frontier, highlighting that starting with a stronger base model is a more effective way to improve novelty.

  Large language models (LLMs) pre-trained predominantly on English text exhibit surprising multilingual capabilities, yet the mechanisms driving cross-lingual generalization remain poorly understood. This work investigates how the alignment of representations for text written in different languages correlates with LLM performance on natural language understanding tasks and translation tasks, both at the language and the instance level. For this purpose, we introduce cross-lingual alignment metrics such as the Discriminative Alignment Index (DALI) to quantify the alignment at an instance level for discriminative tasks. Through experiments on three natural language understanding tasks (Belebele, XStoryCloze, XCOPA), and machine translation, we find that while cross-lingual alignment metrics strongly correlate with task accuracy at the language level, the sample-level alignment often fails to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions, exposing alignment as a necessary but insufficient condition for success.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models become increasingly capable at various writing tasks, their weakness at generating unique and creative content becomes a major liability. Although LLMs have the ability to generate text covering diverse topics, there is an overall sense of repetitiveness across texts that we aim to formalize and quantify via a similarity metric. The familiarity between documents arises from the persistence of underlying discourse structures. However, existing similarity metrics dependent on lexical overlap and syntactic patterns largely capture $\textit{content}$ overlap, thus making them unsuitable for detecting $\textit{structural}$ similarities. We introduce an abstraction based on linguistic theories in Questions Under Discussion (QUD) and question semantics to help quantify differences in discourse progression. We then use this framework to build $\textbf{QUDsim}$, a similarity metric that can detect discursive parallels between documents. Using QUDsim, we find that LLMs often reuse discourse structures (more so than humans) across samples, even when content differs. Furthermore, LLMs are not only repetitive and structurally uniform, but are also divergent from human authors in the types of structures they use.

  Legal multi-label classification is a critical task for organizing and accessing the vast amount of legal documentation. Despite its importance, it faces challenges such as the complexity of legal language, intricate label dependencies, and significant label imbalance. In this paper, we propose Legal-LLM, a novel approach that leverages the instruction-following capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through fine-tuning. We reframe the multi-label classification task as a structured generation problem, instructing the LLM to directly output the relevant legal categories for a given document. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, POSTURE50K and EURLEX57K, using micro-F1 and macro-F1 scores. Our experimental results demonstrate that Legal-LLM outperforms a range of strong baseline models, including traditional methods and other Transformer-based approaches. Furthermore, ablation studies and human evaluations validate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in handling label imbalance and generating relevant and accurate legal labels.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers large language models to perform tasks by conditioning on a few input-output examples. However, the performance of ICL is highly sensitive to the selection of these demonstrations. While existing methods focus on similarity or contrastive selection, they often overlook the importance of diversity among the chosen examples. In this paper, we propose DiverseConE (Diversity-Enhanced Contrastive Example Selection), a novel approach for demonstration selection in in-context learning for machine translation. Our method builds upon contrastive selection by incorporating a diversity enhancement step based on embedding space dissimilarity. We conduct extensive experiments on the Llama2-7b model across four language pairs (English-Chinese, Chinese-English, Russian-German, German-Russian) in 1-shot and 3-shot settings, using COMET20 and COMET22 for evaluation. Our results demonstrate that DiverseConE consistently outperforms strong baseline methods, including random selection, BM25, TopK, and a state-of-the-art contrastive selection method. Further analysis, including diversity metrics and human evaluation, validates the effectiveness of our approach and highlights the benefits of considering demonstration diversity for improved translation quality.

  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has brought significant benefits to various domains while introducing substantial risks. Despite being fine-tuned through reinforcement learning, LLMs lack the capability to discern malicious content, limiting their defense against jailbreak. To address these safety concerns, we propose a feature-aware method for harmful response rejection (FMM), which detects the presence of malicious features within the model's feature space and adaptively adjusts the model's rejection mechanism. By employing a simple discriminator, we detect potential malicious traits during the decoding phase. Upon detecting features indicative of toxic tokens, FMM regenerates the current token. By employing activation patching, an additional rejection vector is incorporated during the subsequent token generation, steering the model towards a refusal response. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple language models and diverse attack techniques, while crucially maintaining the models' standard generation capabilities.

  Transformer-based language models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). However, using these models often involves navigating multiple frameworks and tools, as well as writing repetitive boilerplate code. This complexity can discourage non-programmers and beginners, and even slow down prototyping for experienced developers. To address these challenges, we introduce Langformers, an open-source Python library designed to streamline NLP pipelines through a unified, factory-based interface for large language model (LLM) and masked language model (MLM) tasks. Langformers integrates conversational AI, MLM pretraining, text classification, sentence embedding/reranking, data labelling, semantic search, and knowledge distillation into a cohesive API, supporting popular platforms such as Hugging Face and Ollama. Key innovations include: (1) task-specific factories that abstract training, inference, and deployment complexities; (2) built-in memory and streaming for conversational agents; and (3) lightweight, modular design that prioritizes ease of use.

  In real-world applications of large language models, outputs are often required to be confined: selecting items from predefined product or document sets, generating phrases that comply with safety standards, or conforming to specialized formatting styles. To control the generation, constrained decoding has been widely adopted. However, existing prefix-tree-based constrained decoding is inefficient under GPU-based model inference paradigms, and it introduces unintended biases into the output distribution. This paper introduces Dynamic Importance Sampling for Constrained Decoding (DISC) with GPU-based Parallel Prefix-Verification (PPV), a novel algorithm that leverages dynamic importance sampling to achieve theoretically guaranteed asymptotic unbiasedness and overcomes the inefficiency of prefix-tree. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods in both efficiency and output quality. These results highlight the potential of our methods to improve constrained generation in applications where adherence to specific constraints is essential.

  Comedy serves as a profound reflection of the times we live in and is a staple element of human interactions. In light of the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), the intersection of humor and AI has become no laughing matter. Advancements in the naturalness of human-computer interaction correlates with improvements in AI systems' abilities to understand humor. In this study, we assess the ability of models in accurately identifying humorous quotes from a stand-up comedy transcript. Stand-up comedy's unique comedic narratives make it an ideal dataset to improve the overall naturalness of comedic understanding. We propose a novel humor detection metric designed to evaluate LLMs amongst various prompts on their capability to extract humorous punchlines. The metric has a modular structure that offers three different scoring methods - fuzzy string matching, sentence embedding, and subspace similarity - to provide an overarching assessment of a model's performance. The model's results are compared against those of human evaluators on the same task. Our metric reveals that regardless of prompt engineering, leading models, ChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek, achieve scores of at most 51% in humor detection. Notably, this performance surpasses that of humans who achieve a score of 41%. The analysis of human evaluators and LLMs reveals variability in agreement, highlighting the subjectivity inherent in humor and the complexities involved in extracting humorous quotes from live performance transcripts.

  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating discourse annotation for conversations. While manually designing tree annotation schemes significantly improves annotation quality for humans and models, their creation remains time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. We propose a fully automated pipeline that uses LLMs to construct such schemes and perform annotation. We evaluate our approach on speech functions (SFs) and the Switchboard-DAMSL (SWBD-DAMSL) taxonomies. Our experiments compare various design choices, and we show that frequency-guided decision trees, paired with an advanced LLM for annotation, can outperform previously manually designed trees and even match or surpass human annotators while significantly reducing the time required for annotation. We release all code and resultant schemes and annotations to facilitate future research on discourse annotation.

  Forecasting communication derailment can be useful in real-world settings such as online content moderation, conflict resolution, and business negotiations. However, despite language models' success at identifying offensive speech present in conversations, they struggle to forecast future communication derailments. In contrast to prior work that predicts conversation outcomes solely based on the past conversation history, our approach samples multiple future conversation trajectories conditioned on existing conversation history using a fine-tuned LLM. It predicts the communication outcome based on the consensus of these trajectories. We also experimented with leveraging socio-linguistic attributes, which reflect turn-level conversation dynamics, as guidance when generating future conversations. Our method of future conversation trajectories surpasses state-of-the-art results on English communication derailment prediction benchmarks and demonstrates significant accuracy gains in ablation studies.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) more deeply integrate into human life across various regions, aligning them with pluralistic cultures is crucial for improving user experience and mitigating cultural conflicts. Existing approaches develop culturally aligned LLMs primarily through fine-tuning with massive carefully curated culture-specific corpora. Nevertheless, inspired by culture theories, we identify two key challenges faced by these datasets: (1) Representativeness: These corpora fail to fully capture the target culture's core characteristics with redundancy, causing computation waste; (2) Distinctiveness: They struggle to distinguish the unique nuances of a given culture from shared patterns across other relevant ones, hindering precise cultural modeling. To handle these challenges, we introduce CAReDiO, a novel cultural data construction framework. Specifically, CAReDiO utilizes powerful LLMs to automatically generate cultural conversation data, where both the queries and responses are further optimized by maximizing representativeness and distinctiveness. Using CAReDiO, we construct a small yet effective dataset, covering five cultures, and compare it with several recent cultural corpora. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates more effective data and enables cultural alignment with as few as 100 training samples, enhancing both performance and efficiency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to time series forecasting tasks, leveraging pre-trained language models as the backbone and incorporating textual data to purportedly enhance the comprehensive capabilities of LLMs for time series. However, are these texts really helpful for interpretation? This study seeks to investigate the actual efficacy and interpretability of such textual incorporations. Through a series of empirical experiments on textual prompts and textual prototypes, our findings reveal that the misalignment between two modalities exists, and the textual information does not significantly improve time series forecasting performance in many cases. Furthermore, visualization analysis indicates that the textual representations learned by existing frameworks lack sufficient interpretability when applied to time series data. We further propose a novel metric named Semantic Matching Index (SMI) to better evaluate the matching degree between time series and texts during our post hoc interpretability investigation. Our analysis reveals the misalignment and limited interpretability of texts in current time-series LLMs, and we hope this study can raise awareness of the interpretability of texts for time series.

  The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) present a key challenge of maintaining effective human oversight. Weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) offers a promising framework for supervising increasingly capable LLMs using weaker ones. Traditional W2SG methods rely on passive learning, where a weak teacher provides noisy demonstrations to train a strong student. This hinders students from employing their knowledge during training and reaching their full potential. In this work, we introduce Alice (pro{A}ctive {l}earning w{i}th tea{c}her's D{e}monstrations), a framework that leverages complementary knowledge between teacher and student to enhance the learning process. We probe the knowledge base of the teacher model by eliciting their uncertainty, and then use these insights together with teachers' responses as demonstrations to guide student models in self-generating improved responses for supervision. In addition, for situations with significant capability gaps between teacher and student models, we introduce cascade Alice, which employs a hierarchical training approach where weak teachers initially supervise intermediate models, who then guide stronger models in sequence. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the W2SG performance, yielding substantial improvements in three key tasks compared to the original W2SG: knowledge-based reasoning (+4.0%), mathematical reasoning (+22.62%), and logical reasoning (+12.11%). This highlights the effectiveness of our new W2SG paradigm that enables more robust knowledge transfer and supervision outcome.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied across various tasks, instruction tuning has emerged as a critical method for enhancing model performance. However, current data management strategies face substantial challenges in generating diverse and comprehensive data, restricting further improvements in model performance. To address this gap, we propose MDIT, a novel model-free data interpolation method for diverse instruction tuning, which generates varied and high-quality instruction data by performing task interpolation. Moreover, it contains diversity-based clustering strategies to ensure the diversity of the training data. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in multiple benchmark tasks. The LLMs finetuned with MDIT show significant improvements in numerous tasks such as general question answering, math reasoning, and code generation. MDIT offers an efficient and automatic data synthetic method, generating diverse instruction data without depending on external resources while expanding the application potential of LLMs in complex environments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), it has become a consensus that a few high-quality instructions are superior to a large number of low-quality instructions. At present, many instruction selection methods have been proposed, but most of these methods select instruction based on heuristic quality metrics, and only consider data selection before training. These designs lead to insufficient optimization of instruction fine-tuning, and fixed heuristic indicators are often difficult to optimize for specific tasks. So we designed a dynamic, task-objective-driven instruction selection framework RAISE(Reinforenced Adaptive Instruction SElection), which incorporates the entire instruction fine-tuning process into optimization, selecting instruction at each step based on the expected impact of instruction on model performance improvement. Our approach is well interpretable and has strong task-specific optimization capabilities. By modeling dynamic instruction selection as a sequential decision-making process, we use RL to train our selection strategy. Extensive experiments and result analysis prove the superiority of our method compared with other instruction selection methods. Notably, RAISE achieves superior performance by updating only 1\% of the training steps compared to full-data training, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the evolving landscape of conversational AI, generating concise, context-aware, and human-like dialogue using small and medium-sized language models (LLMs) remains a complex challenge. This study investigates the influence of LoRA rank, dataset scale, and prompt prefix design on both knowledge retention and stylistic alignment. While fine-tuning improves fluency and enables stylistic customization, its ability to integrate unseen knowledge is constrained -- particularly with smaller datasets. Conversely, RAG-augmented models, equipped to incorporate external documents at inference, demonstrated superior factual accuracy on out-of-distribution prompts, though they lacked the stylistic consistency achieved by fine-tuning. Evaluations by LLM-based judges across knowledge accuracy, conversational quality, and conciseness suggest that fine-tuning is best suited for tone adaptation, whereas RAG excels at real-time knowledge augmentation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has seen increasing adoption in healthcare, with specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging to support clinical applications. A fundamental requirement for these models is accurate identification of TCM drug ingredients. In this paper, we evaluate how general and TCM-specialized LLMs perform when identifying ingredients of Chinese drugs. Our systematic analysis reveals consistent failure patterns: models often interpret drug names literally, overuse common herbs regardless of relevance, and exhibit erratic behaviors when faced with unfamiliar formulations. LLMs also fail to understand the verification task. These findings demonstrate that current LLMs rely primarily on drug names rather than possessing systematic pharmacological knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach focused on ingredient names. Experiments across 220 TCM formulations show our method significantly improves accuracy from approximately 50% to 82% in ingredient verification tasks. Our work highlights critical weaknesses in current TCM-specific LLMs and offers a practical solution for enhancing their clinical reliability.

  _Z√©bulon Goriely, Paula Buttery_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models provide a key framework for studying linguistic theories based on prediction, but phonological analysis using large language models (LLMs) is difficult; there are few phonological benchmarks beyond English and the standard input representation used in LLMs (subwords of graphemes) is not suitable for analyzing the representation of phonemes. In this work, we demonstrate how word segmentation can be used as a phonological probing task, allowing us to study the representations learned by phoneme-based language models trained on child-directed speech across 31 languages. Following computational models of word segmentation, we present unsupervised methods for extracting word boundaries from a trained model using the observation that prediction-error peaks at the start of words. We also use linear probes to identify that these models implicitly track word boundaries, even when they do not appear in training. This cross-lingual work corroborates statistical learning theories of acquisition and empirically motivates new methods for training subword tokenizers.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across tasks, yet they often require additional prompting techniques when facing complex problems. While approaches like self-correction and response selection have emerged as popular solutions, recent studies have shown these methods perform poorly when relying on the LLM itself to provide feedback or selection criteria. We argue this limitation stems from the fact that common LLM post-training procedures lack explicit supervision for discriminative judgment tasks. In this paper, we propose Generative Self-Aggregation (GSA), a novel prompting method that improves answer quality without requiring the model's discriminative capabilities. GSA first samples multiple diverse responses from the LLM, then aggregates them to obtain an improved solution. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require the LLM to correct errors or compare response quality; instead, it leverages the model's generative abilities to synthesize a new response based on the context of multiple samples. While GSA shares similarities with the self-consistency (SC) approach for response aggregation, SC requires specific verifiable tokens to enable majority voting. In contrast, our approach is more general and can be applied to open-ended tasks. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that GSA effectively improves response quality across various tasks, including mathematical reasoning, knowledge-based problems, and open-ended generation tasks such as code synthesis and conversational responses.

  Personalized tool utilization is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preference in interaction scenarios with various tools. However, most of the current benchmarks primarily focus on either personalization of text generation or direct tool-utilizing, without considering both. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark ETAPP for evaluating personalized tool invocation, establishing a sandbox environment, and a comprehensive dataset of 800 testing cases covering diverse user profiles. To improve the accuracy of our evaluation, we propose a key-point-based LLM evaluation method, mitigating biases in the LLM-as-a-judge system by manually annotating key points for each test case and providing them to LLM as the reference. Additionally, we evaluate the excellent LLMs and provide an in-depth analysis. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different tool-invoking strategies on LLMs' personalization performance and the effects of fine-tuning in our task. The effectiveness of our preference-setting and key-point-based evaluation method is also validated. Our findings offer insights into improving personalized LLM agents.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved multi-step reasoning through generating free-text rationales. However, recent studies show that LLMs tend to lose focus over the middle of long contexts. This raises concerns that as reasoning progresses, LLMs may overlook information in earlier steps when decoding subsequent steps, leading to generate unreliable and redundant rationales. To address this, we propose guiding LLMs to generate more accurate and concise step-by-step rationales by (1) proactively referencing information from underutilized prior steps, and (2) minimizing redundant information between new and existing steps. We introduce stepwise informativeness search, an inference-time tree search framework incorporating two selection heuristics: grounding-guided selection which prioritizes steps paying higher attention over underutilized steps; and novelty-guided selection which encourages steps with novel conclusions. During rationale generation, we use a self-grounding strategy that prompts LLMs to explicitly reference relevant prior steps to provide premises before deduction at each step. Experimental results on four reasoning datasets demonstrate that our approach improves reasoning accuracy by generating higher-quality rationales with reduced errors and redundancy.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities in well-defined problems with clear solutions, such as mathematics and coding. However, they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios like business negotiations, which require strategic reasoning-an ability to navigate dynamic environments and align long-term goals amidst uncertainty. Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts. To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (EPO) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior. To improve adaptability and policy transferability, we train the strategic reasoning model via multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) using process rewards and iterative self-play, without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. Experiments across social and physical domains demonstrate EPO's ability of long-term goal alignment through enhanced strategic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on social dialogue and web navigation tasks. Our findings reveal various collaborative reasoning mechanisms emergent in EPO and its effectiveness in generating novel strategies, underscoring its potential for strategic reasoning in real-world applications.

  With the rapid development of Large language models (LLMs), understanding the capabilities of LLMs in identifying unsafe content has become increasingly important. While previous works have introduced several benchmarks to evaluate the safety risk of LLMs, the community still has a limited understanding of current LLMs' capability to recognize illegal and unsafe content in Chinese contexts. In this work, we present a Chinese safety benchmark (ChineseSafe) to facilitate research on the content safety of large language models. To align with the regulations for Chinese Internet content moderation, our ChineseSafe contains 205,034 examples across 4 classes and 10 sub-classes of safety issues. For Chinese contexts, we add several special types of illegal content: political sensitivity, pornography, and variant/homophonic words. Moreover, we employ two methods to evaluate the legal risks of popular LLMs, including open-sourced models and APIs. The results reveal that many LLMs exhibit vulnerability to certain types of safety issues, leading to legal risks in China. Our work provides a guideline for developers and researchers to facilitate the safety of LLMs. Our results are also available atthis https URL. Additionally, we release a test set comprising 200,000 examples, which is publicly accessible atthis https URL.

  Reranking documents based on their relevance to a given query is a critical task in information retrieval. Traditional reranking methods often lack transparency and rely on proprietary models, hindering reproducibility and interpretability. We propose Reason-to-Rank (R2R), a novel open-source reranking approach that enhances transparency by generating two types of reasoning: direct relevance reasoning, which explains how a document addresses the query, and comparison reasoning, which justifies the relevance of one document over another. We leverage large language models (LLMs) as teacher models to generate these explanations and distill this knowledge into smaller, openly available student models. Our student models are trained to generate meaningful reasoning and rerank documents, achieving competitive performance across multiple datasets, including MSMARCO and BRIGHT. Experiments demonstrate that R2R not only improves reranking accuracy but also provides valuable insights into the decision-making process. By offering a structured and interpretable solution with openly accessible resources, R2R aims to bridge the gap between effectiveness and transparency in information retrieval, fostering reproducibility and further research in the field.

  Automated generation of scientific protocols executable by robots can significantly accelerate scientific research processes. Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at Scientific Protocol Formulation Tasks (SPFT), but the evaluation of their capabilities rely on human evaluation. Here, we propose a flexible, automatic framework to evaluate LLMs' capability on SPFT: ProtoMed-LLM. This framework prompts the target model and GPT-4 to extract pseudocode from biology protocols using only predefined lab actions and evaluates the output of the target model using LLAM-EVAL, the pseudocode generated by GPT-4 serving as a baseline and Llama-3 acting as the evaluator. Our adaptable prompt-based evaluation method, LLAM-EVAL, offers significant flexibility in terms of evaluation model, material, criteria, and is free of cost. We evaluate GPT variations, Llama, Mixtral, Gemma, Cohere, and Gemini. Overall, we find that GPT and Cohere are powerful scientific protocol formulators. We also introduce BIOPROT 2.0, a dataset with biology protocols and corresponding pseudocodes, which can aid LLMs in formulation and evaluation of SPFT. Our work is extensible to assess LLMs on SPFT across various domains and other fields that require protocol generation for specific goals.

  We present PLAYER*, a novel framework for Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents in Murder Mystery Games (MMGs). MMGs pose unique challenges, including undefined state spaces, absent intermediate rewards, and the need for strategic interaction in a continuous language domain. PLAYER* addresses these complexities through a sensor-based representation of agent states, a question-targeting mechanism guided by information gain, and a pruning strategy to refine suspect lists and enhance decision-making efficiency. To enable systematic evaluation, we propose WellPlay, a dataset comprising 1,482 inferential questions across 12 games, categorized into objectives, reasoning, and relationships. Experiments demonstrate PLAYER*'s capacity to achieve superior performance in reasoning accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches, while also significantly improving the quality of agent-human interactions in MMGs.

  Enhancing the spatial perception capabilities of mobile robots is crucial for achieving embodied Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). Although significant progress has been made in simulated environments, directly transferring these capabilities to real-world scenarios often results in severe hallucination phenomena, causing robots to lose effective spatial awareness. To address this issue, we propose BrainNav, a bio-inspired spatial cognitive navigation framework inspired by biological spatial cognition theories and cognitive map theory. BrainNav integrates dual-map (coordinate map and topological map) and dual-orientation (relative orientation and absolute orientation) strategies, enabling real-time navigation through dynamic scene capture and path planning. Its five core modules-Hippocampal Memory Hub, Visual Cortex Perception Engine, Parietal Spatial Constructor, Prefrontal Decision Center, and Cerebellar Motion Execution Unit-mimic biological cognitive functions to reduce spatial hallucinations and enhance adaptability. Validated in a zero-shot real-world lab environment using the Limo Pro robot, BrainNav, compatible with GPT-4, outperforms existing State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) methods without fine-tuning.

  Objective: This study investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an alternative to human expert elicitation for extracting structured causal knowledge and facilitating causal modeling in biometric and healthcare applications.Material and Methods: LLM-generated causal structures, specifically Bayesian networks (BNs), were benchmarked against traditional statistical methods (e.g., Bayesian Information Criterion) using healthcare datasets. Validation techniques included structural equation modeling (SEM) to verifying relationships, and measures such as entropy, predictive accuracy, and robustness to compare network structures.Results and Discussion: LLM-generated BNs demonstrated lower entropy than expert-elicited and statistically generated BNs, suggesting higher confidence and precision in predictions. However, limitations such as contextual constraints, hallucinated dependencies, and potential biases inherited from training data require further investigation.Conclusion: LLMs represent a novel frontier in expert elicitation for probabilistic causal modeling, promising to improve transparency and reduce uncertainty in the decision-making using such models.

  Reward models (RMs) play a crucial role in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback by serving as proxies for human preferences in aligning large language models. In this paper, we identify a model preference bias in RMs, where they systematically assign disproportionately high scores to responses from certain policy models. This bias distorts ranking evaluations and leads to unfair judgments. To address this issue, we propose a calibration method named CHatbot Arena calibrated Reward Modeling (CHARM) that leverages Elo scores from the Chatbot Arena leaderboard to mitigate RM overvaluation. We also introduce a Mismatch Degree metric to measure this preference bias. Our approach is computationally efficient, requiring only a small preference dataset for continued training of the RM. We conduct extensive experiments on reward model benchmarks and human preference alignment. Results demonstrate that our calibrated RMs (1) achieve improved evaluation accuracy on RM-Bench and the Chat-Hard domain of RewardBench, and (2) exhibit a stronger correlation with human preferences by producing scores more closely aligned with Elo rankings. By mitigating model preference bias, our method provides a generalizable and efficient solution for building fairer and more reliable reward models.

  Bus holding control is a widely-adopted strategy for maintaining stability and improving the operational efficiency of bus systems. Traditional model-based methods often face challenges with the low accuracy of bus state prediction and passenger demand estimation. In contrast, Reinforcement Learning (RL), as a data-driven approach, has demonstrated great potential in formulating bus holding strategies. RL determines the optimal control strategies in order to maximize the cumulative reward, which reflects the overall control goals. However, translating sparse and delayed control goals in real-world tasks into dense and real-time rewards for RL is challenging, normally requiring extensive manual trial-and-error. In view of this, this study introduces an automatic reward generation paradigm by leveraging the in-context learning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This new paradigm, termed the LLM-enhanced RL, comprises several LLM-based modules: reward initializer, reward modifier, performance analyzer, and reward refiner. These modules cooperate to initialize and iteratively improve the reward function according to the feedback from training and test results for the specified RL-based task. Ineffective reward functions generated by the LLM are filtered out to ensure the stable evolution of the RL agents' performance over iterations. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed LLM-enhanced RL paradigm, it is applied to extensive bus holding control scenarios that vary in the number of bus lines, stops, and passenger demand. The results demonstrate the superiority, generalization capability, and robustness of the proposed paradigm compared to vanilla RL strategies, the LLM-based controller, physics-based feedback controllers, and optimization-based controllers. This study sheds light on the great potential of utilizing LLMs in various smart mobility applications.

  Humans have the ability to reason about geometric patterns in images and scenes from a young age. However, developing large multimodal models (LMMs) capable of similar reasoning remains a challenge, highlighting the need for robust evaluation methods to assess these capabilities. We introduce \Turtle, a benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs' capacity to interpret geometric patterns -- given visual examples, textual instructions, or both -- and generate precise code outputs. Inspired by turtle geometry, a notion used to teach children foundational coding and geometric concepts, TurtleBench features tasks with patterned shapes that have underlying algorithmic logic. Our evaluation reveals that leading LMMs struggle significantly with these tasks, with GPT-4o achieving only 19\% accuracy on the simplest tasks and few-shot prompting only marginally improves their performance ($<2\%$). \Turtle highlights the gap between human and AI performance in intuitive and visual geometrical understanding, setting the stage for future research in this area. \Turtle stands as one of the few benchmarks to evaluate the integration of visual understanding and code generation capabilities in LMMs, setting the stage for future research.

Using the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen, we find that bypassing the thinking process via simple prompting, denoted as NoThinking, can be surprisingly effective. When controlling for the number of tokens, NoThinking outperforms Thinking across a diverse set of seven challenging reasoning datasets--including mathematical problem solving, formal theorem proving, and coding--especially in low-budget settings, e.g., 51.3 vs. 28.9 on ACM 23 with 700 tokens. Notably, the performance of NoThinking becomes more competitive with pass@k as k increases. Building on this observation, we demonstrate that a parallel scaling approach that uses NoThinking to generate N outputs independently and aggregates them is highly effective. For aggregation, we use task-specific verifiers when available, or we apply simple best-of-N strategies such as confidence-based selection. Our method outperforms a range of baselines with similar latency using Thinking, and is comparable to Thinking with significantly longer latency (up to 9x). Together, our research encourages a reconsideration of the necessity of lengthy thinking processes, while also establishing a competitive reference for achieving strong reasoning performance in low-budget settings or at low latency using parallel scaling.

  Over the past year, the development of large language models (LLMs) has brought spatial intelligence into focus, with much attention on vision-based embodied intelligence. However, spatial intelligence spans a broader range of disciplines and scales, from navigation and urban planning to remote sensing and earth science. What are the differences and connections between spatial intelligence across these fields? In this paper, we first review human spatial cognition and its implications for spatial intelligence in LLMs. We then examine spatial memory, knowledge representations, and abstract reasoning in LLMs, highlighting their roles and connections. Finally, we analyze spatial intelligence across scales -- from embodied to urban and global levels -- following a framework that progresses from spatial memory and understanding to spatial reasoning and intelligence. Through this survey, we aim to provide insights into interdisciplinary spatial intelligence research and inspire future studies.

  Scientific diagrams are vital tools for communicating structured knowledge across disciplines. However, they are often published as static raster images, losing symbolic semantics and limiting reuse. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a pathway to bridging vision and structure, existing methods lack semantic control and structural interpretability, especially on complex diagrams. We propose Draw with Thought (DwT), a training-free framework that guides MLLMs to reconstruct diagrams into editable mxGraph XML code through cognitively-grounded Chain-of-Thought reasoning. DwT enables interpretable and controllable outputs without model fine-tuning by dividing the task into two stages: Coarse-to-Fine Planning, which handles perceptual structuring and semantic specification, and Structure-Aware Code Generation, enhanced by format-guided refinement. To support evaluation, we release Plot2XML, a benchmark of 247 real-world scientific diagrams with gold-standard XML annotations. Extensive experiments across eight MLLMs show that our approach yields high-fidelity, semantically aligned, and structurally valid reconstructions, with human evaluations confirming strong alignment in both accuracy and visual aesthetics, offering a scalable solution for converting static visuals into executable representations and advancing machine understanding of scientific graphics.

  Recently, stepwise supervision on Chain of Thoughts (CoTs) presents an enhancement on the logical reasoning tasks such as coding and math, with the help of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, its contribution to tasks requiring domain-specific expertise and knowledge remains unexplored. Motivated by the interest, we identify several potential challenges of vanilla MCTS within this context, and propose the framework of Stepwise Domain Knowledge-Driven Reasoning Optimization, employing the MCTS algorithm to develop step-level supervision for problems that require essential comprehension, reasoning, and specialized knowledge. Additionally, we also introduce the Preference Optimization towards Reflection Paths, which iteratively learns self-reflection on the reasoning thoughts from better perspectives. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the advantage of the methodologies. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness on various legal-domain problems. We also report a diverse set of valuable findings, hoping to encourage the enthusiasm to the research of domain-specific LLMs and MCTS.

  Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process that enables logical inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reasoning has emerged as a key capability that distinguishes advanced AI systems from conventional models that empower chatbots. In this survey, we categorize existing methods along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) Regimes, which define the stage at which reasoning is achieved (either at inference time or through dedicated training); and (2) Architectures, which determine the components involved in the reasoning process, distinguishing between standalone LLMs and agentic compound systems that incorporate external tools, and multi-agent collaborations. Within each dimension, we analyze two key perspectives: (1) Input level, which focuses on techniques that construct high-quality prompts that the LLM condition on; and (2) Output level, which methods that refine multiple sampled candidates to enhance reasoning quality. This categorization provides a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape of LLM reasoning, highlighting emerging trends such as the shift from inference-scaling to learning-to-reason (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and the transition to agentic workflows (e.g., OpenAI Deep Research, Manus Agent). Additionally, we cover a broad spectrum of learning algorithms, from supervised fine-tuning to reinforcement learning such as PPO and GRPO, and the training of reasoners and verifiers. We also examine key designs of agentic workflows, from established patterns like generator-evaluator and LLM debate to recent innovations. ...

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents for multi-step tasks. However, most existing frameworks fail to maintain a structured understanding of the task state, often relying on linear prompt concatenation or shallow memory buffers. This leads to brittle performance, frequent hallucinations, and poor long-range coherence. In this work, we propose the Task Memory Engine (TME), a lightweight and structured memory module that tracks task execution using a hierarchical Task Memory Tree (TMT). Each node in the tree corresponds to a task step, storing relevant input, output, status, and sub-task relationships. We introduce a prompt synthesis method that dynamically generates LLM prompts based on the active node path, significantly improving execution consistency and contextual grounding. Through case studies and comparative experiments on multi-step agent tasks, we demonstrate that TME leads to better task completion accuracy and more interpretable behavior with minimal implementation overhead. A reference implementation of the core TME components is available atthis https URL, including basic examples and structured memory integration. While the current implementation uses a tree-based structure, TME is designed to be graph-aware, supporting reusable substeps, converging task paths, and shared dependencies. This lays the groundwork for future DAG-based memory architectures.

  This paper presents AutoEval, a novel benchmark for scaling Large Language Model (LLM) assessment in formal tasks with clear notions of correctness, such as truth maintenance in translation and logical reasoning. AutoEval is the first benchmarking paradigm that offers several key advantages necessary for scaling objective evaluation of LLMs without human labeling: (a) ability to evaluate LLMs of increasing sophistication by auto-generating tasks at different levels of difficulty; (b) auto-generation of ground truth that eliminates dependence on expensive and time-consuming human annotation; (c) the use of automatically generated, randomized datasets that mitigate the ability of successive LLMs to overfit to static datasets used in many contemporary benchmarks. Empirical analysis shows that an LLM's performance on AutoEval is highly indicative of its performance on a diverse array of other benchmarks focusing on translation and reasoning tasks, making it a valuable autonomous evaluation paradigm in settings where hand-curated datasets can be hard to obtain and/or update.

  An AI system can create and maintain knowledge only to the extent that it can verify that knowledge itself. Recent work on long Chain-of-Thought reasoning has demonstrated great potential of LLMs on solving competitive problems, but their verification ability remains to be weak and not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, we propose Heimdall, the long CoT verification LLM that can accurately judge the correctness of solutions. With pure reinforcement learning, we boost the verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on competitive math problems. By scaling with repeated sampling, the accuracy further increases to 97.5%. Through human evaluation, Heimdall demonstrates impressive generalization capabilities, successfully detecting most issues in challenging math proofs, the type of which is not included during training. Furthermore, we propose Pessimistic Verification to extend the functionality of Heimdall to scaling up the problem solving. It calls Heimdall to judge the solutions from a solver model and based on the pessimistic principle, selects the most likely correct solution with the least uncertainty. Taking DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the solver model, Pessimistic Verification improves the solution accuracy on AIME2025 from 54.2% to 70.0% with 16x compute budget and to 83.3% with more compute budget. With the stronger solver Gemini 2.5 Pro, the score reaches 93.0%. Finally, we prototype an automatic knowledge discovery system, a ternary system where one poses questions, another provides solutions, and the third verifies the solutions. Using the data synthesis work NuminaMath for the first two components, Heimdall effectively identifies problematic records within the dataset and reveals that nearly half of the data is flawed, which interestingly aligns with the recent ablation studies from NuminaMath.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agents-based news-driven time series forecasting is considered as a potential paradigm shift in the era of large language models (LLMs). The challenge of this task lies in measuring the influences of different news events towards the fluctuations of time series. This requires agents to possess stronger abilities of innovative thinking and the identifying misleading logic. However, the existing multi-agent discussion framework has limited enhancement on time series prediction in terms of optimizing these two capabilities. Inspired by the role of competition in fostering innovation, this study embeds a competition mechanism within the multi-agent discussion to enhance agents' capability of generating innovative thoughts. Furthermore, to bolster the model's proficiency in identifying misleading information, we incorporate a fine-tuned small-scale LLM model within the reflective stage, offering auxiliary decision-making support. Experimental results confirm that the competition can boost agents' capacity for innovative thinking, which can significantly improve the performances of time series prediction. Similar to the findings of social science, the intensity of competition within this framework can influence the performances of agents, providing a new perspective for studying LLMs-based multi-agent systems.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs have been remarkable. However, these models still rely solely on their parametric knowledge, which limits their ability to generate up-to-date information and increases the risk of producing erroneous content. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially mitigates these challenges by incorporating external data sources, yet the reliance on databases and retrieval systems can introduce irrelevant or inaccurate documents, ultimately undermining both performance and reasoning quality. In this paper, we propose Multi-Modal Knowledge-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMKB-RAG), a novel multi-modal RAG framework that leverages the inherent knowledge boundaries of models to dynamically generate semantic tags for the retrieval process. This strategy enables the joint filtering of retrieved documents, retaining only the most relevant and accurate references. Extensive experiments on knowledge-based visual question-answering tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach: on the E-VQA dataset, our method improves performance by +4.2\% on the Single-Hop subset and +0.4\% on the full dataset, while on the InfoSeek dataset, it achieves gains of +7.8\% on the Unseen-Q subset, +8.2\% on the Unseen-E subset, and +8.1\% on the full dataset. These results highlight significant enhancements in both accuracy and robustness over the current state-of-the-art MLLM and RAG frameworks.

  Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward solving complex, real-world tasks that single-agent systems often struggle to manage. While recent advancements in test-time scaling (TTS) have significantly improved single-agent performance on challenging reasoning tasks, how to effectively scale collaboration and reasoning in MAS remains an open question. In this work, we introduce an adaptive multi-agent framework designed to enhance collaborative reasoning through both model-level training and system-level coordination. We construct M500, a high-quality dataset containing 500 multi-agent collaborative reasoning traces, and fine-tune Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct on this dataset to produce M1-32B, a model optimized for multi-agent collaboration. To further enable adaptive reasoning, we propose a novel CEO agent that dynamically manages the discussion process, guiding agent collaboration and adjusting reasoning depth for more effective problem-solving. Evaluated in an open-source MAS across a range of tasks-including general understanding, mathematical reasoning, and coding-our system significantly outperforms strong baselines. For instance, M1-32B achieves 12% improvement on GPQA-Diamond, 41% on AIME2024, and 10% on MBPP-Sanitized, matching the performance of state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 on some tasks. These results highlight the importance of both learned collaboration and adaptive coordination in scaling multi-agent reasoning. Code is available atthis https URL

  Existing evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents on scientific discovery lacks objective baselines and metrics to assess the viability of their proposed methods. To address this issue, we introduce MLRC-Bench, a benchmark designed to quantify how effectively language agents can tackle challenging Machine Learning (ML) Research Competitions. Our benchmark highlights open research problems that demand novel methodologies, in contrast to recent benchmarks such as OpenAI's MLE-Bench (Chan et al., 2024) and METR's RE-Bench (Wijk et al., 2024), which focus on well-established research tasks that are largely solvable through sufficient engineering effort. Unlike prior work, e.g., AI Scientist (Lu et al., 2024b), which evaluates the end-to-end agentic pipeline by using LLM-as-a-judge, MLRC-Bench measures the key steps of proposing and implementing novel research methods and evaluates them with newly proposed rigorous protocol and objective metrics. Our curated suite of 7 competition tasks reveals significant challenges for LLM agents. Even the best-performing tested agent (gemini-exp-1206 under MLAB (Huang et al., 2024a)) closes only 9.3% of the gap between baseline and top human participant scores. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a misalignment between the LLM-judged innovation and their actual performance on cutting-edge ML research problems. MLRC-Bench is a dynamic benchmark, which is designed to continually grow with new ML competitions to encourage rigorous and objective evaluations of AI's research capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent breakthroughs in large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled various generative tasks on a single model. Real-world services (e.g., OpenAI's ChatGPT [27]) powered by an LLM often concurrently support latency-critical requests for interactive applications (e.g., question-answering systems, referred to as real-time or RT requests) and throughput-oriented requests for back-of-house processing (e.g., documents batch processing [28], referred to best-effort or BE requests), with complex hybrid inference workloads to the underlying model. State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM serving systems dedicate machines to each type of request, towards either low inference latency or high serving throughput, respectively. This practice simplifies request scheduling and management but suffers from poor resource utilization. We propose BROS, a hybrid LLM serving system that aims to collocate RT/BE requests, meeting RT requests' latency requirements while maintaining BE requests' throughput. BROS formulates the problem of hybrid RT/BE request scheduling and solves it with a dynamic priority-based algorithm. BROS designs a bidirectional KV cache management mechanism, allowing RT requests to share KV memory with BE requests to remove the scheduling restrictions caused by insufficient KV memory and improve utilization. Extensive experiments validate that BROS achieves a good trade-off when serving hybrid RT and BE requests. It significantly reduces the latency of RT requests (up to 74.20%), improving their fine-grained service level objectives (SLOs) attainments (up to 36.38x), with negligible throughput reduction for BE requests, showing significant advantages over SOTA systems like vLLM and TGI.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning capabilities but remain susceptible to hallucinations producing plausible yet incorrect statements especially in theorem proving, symbolic manipulation, and numerical computation. While self-consistency (SC) has been explored as a means to improve factuality in LLMs, existing approaches primarily apply SC to final-answer selection, neglecting the logical consistency of intermediate reasoning steps. In this work, we introduce a structured self-consistency framework designed to enhance the reliability of mathematical reasoning. Our method enforces self-consistency across intermediate steps and final outputs, reducing logical inconsistencies and hallucinations. We evaluate our approach across three core mathematical tasks: theorem proving, symbolic transformation, and numerical computation. Experimental results demonstrate that SC significantly improves proof validity, symbolic reasoning accuracy, and numerical stability while maintaining computational efficiency. Further analysis reveals that structured self-consistency not only enhances problem-solving accuracy but also reduces the variance of model-generated outputs. These findings highlight self-consistency as a robust mechanism for improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable AI-driven mathematics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current AI systems based on probabilistic neural networks, such as large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities yet face critical challenges including hallucination, unpredictability, and misalignment with human decision-making. These issues fundamentally stem from the over-reliance on randomized (probabilistic) neural networks-oversimplified models of biological neural networks-while neglecting the role of procedural reasoning (chain-of-thought) in trustworthy decision-making. Inspired by the human cognitive duality of fluid intelligence (flexible generation) and crystallized intelligence (structured knowledge), this study proposes a dual-channel intelligent architecture that integrates probabilistic generation (LLMs) with white-box procedural reasoning (chain-of-thought) to construct interpretable, continuously learnable, and human-aligned AI systems. Concretely, this work: (1) redefines chain-of-thought as a programmable crystallized intelligence carrier, enabling dynamic knowledge evolution and decision verification through multi-turn interaction frameworks; (2) introduces a task-driven modular network design that explicitly demarcates the functional boundaries between randomized generation and procedural control to address trustworthiness in vertical-domain applications; (3) demonstrates that multi-turn interaction is a necessary condition for intelligence emergence, with dialogue depth positively correlating with the system's human-alignment degree. This research not only establishes a new paradigm for trustworthy AI deployment but also provides theoretical foundations for next-generation human-AI collaborative systems.

  Despite remarkable progress in machine learning, current AI systems continue to fall short of true human-like intelligence. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in pattern recognition and response generation, they lack genuine understanding - an essential hallmark of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Existing AGI evaluation methods fail to offer a practical, gradual, and informative metric. This paper introduces the Artificial General Intelligence Test Bed (AGITB), comprising twelve rigorous tests that form a signal-processing-level foundation for the potential emergence of cognitive capabilities. AGITB evaluates intelligence through a model's ability to predict binary signals across time without relying on symbolic representations or pretraining. Unlike high-level tests grounded in language or perception, AGITB focuses on core computational invariants reflective of biological intelligence, such as determinism, sensitivity, and generalisation. The test bed assumes no prior bias, operates independently of semantic meaning, and ensures unsolvability through brute force or memorization. While humans pass AGITB by design, no current AI system has met its criteria, making AGITB a compelling benchmark for guiding and recognizing progress toward AGI.

  Current molecular understanding approaches predominantly focus on the descriptive aspect of human perception, providing broad, topic-level insights. However, the referential aspect -- linking molecular concepts to specific structural components -- remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a molecular grounding benchmark designed to evaluate a model's referential abilities. We align molecular grounding with established conventions in NLP, cheminformatics, and molecular science, showcasing the potential of NLP techniques to advance molecular understanding within the AI for Science movement. Furthermore, we constructed the largest molecular understanding benchmark to date, comprising 117k QA pairs, and developed a multi-agent grounding prototype as proof of concept. This system outperforms existing models, including GPT-4o, and its grounding outputs have been integrated to enhance traditional tasks such as molecular captioning and ATC (Anatomical, Therapeutic, Chemical) classification.

  The emergence of large language models offers new possibilities for structured exploration of scientific knowledge. Rather than viewing scientific discovery as isolated ideas or content, we propose a structured approach that emphasizes the role of method combinations in shaping disruptive insights. Specifically, we investigate how knowledge unit--especially those tied to methodological design--can be modeled and recombined to yield research breakthroughs. Our proposed framework addresses two key challenges. First, we introduce a contrastive learning-based mechanism to identify distinguishing features of historically disruptive method combinations within problem-driven contexts. Second, we propose a reasoning-guided Monte Carlo search algorithm that leverages the chain-of-thought capability of LLMs to identify promising knowledge recombinations for new problem statements.Empirical studies across multiple domains show that the framework is capable of modeling the structural dynamics of innovation and successfully highlights combinations with high disruptive potential. This research provides a new path for computationally guided scientific ideation grounded in structured reasoning and historical data modeling.

  Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 use enhanced reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Their potential in hardware design, which relies on expert-driven iterative optimization, remains unexplored. This paper investigates whether reasoning LLMs can address challenges in High-Level Synthesis (HLS) design space exploration and optimization. During HLS, engineers manually define pragmas/directives to balance performance and resource constraints. We propose an LLM-based optimization agentic framework that automatically restructures code, inserts pragmas, and identifies optimal design points via feedback from HLs tools and access to integer-linear programming (ILP) solvers. Experiments compare reasoning models against conventional LLMs on benchmarks using success rate, efficiency, and design quality (area/latency) metrics, and provide the first-ever glimpse into the CoTs produced by a powerful open-source reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the development of intelligent LLM-based agents capable of interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). These agents demonstrate strong reasoning and adaptability, enabling them to perform complex tasks that traditionally required predefined rules. However, the reliance on step-by-step reasoning in LLM-based agents often results in inefficiencies, particularly for routine tasks. In contrast, traditional rule-based systems excel in efficiency but lack the intelligence and flexibility to adapt to novel scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel evolutionary framework for GUI agents that enhances operational efficiency while retaining intelligence and flexibility. Our approach incorporates a memory mechanism that records the agent's task execution history. By analyzing this history, the agent identifies repetitive action sequences and evolves high-level actions that act as shortcuts, replacing these low-level operations and improving efficiency. This allows the agent to focus on tasks requiring more complex reasoning, while simplifying routine actions. Experimental results on multiple benchmark tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both efficiency and accuracy. The code will be open-sourced to support further research.

  Medication errors significantly threaten patient safety, leading to adverse drug events and substantial economic burdens on healthcare systems. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) aimed at mitigating these errors often face limitations when processing unstructured clinical data, including reliance on static databases and rule-based algorithms, frequently generating excessive alerts that lead to alert fatigue among healthcare providers. This paper introduces HELIOT, an innovative CDSS for adverse drug reaction management that processes free-text clinical information using Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with a comprehensive pharmaceutical data repository. HELIOT leverages advanced natural language processing capabilities to interpret medical narratives, extract relevant drug reaction information from unstructured clinical notes, and learn from past patient-specific medication tolerances to reduce false alerts, enabling more nuanced and contextual adverse drug event warnings across primary care, specialist consultations, and hospital settings. An initial evaluation using a synthetic dataset of clinical narratives and expert-verified ground truth shows promising results. HELIOT achieves high accuracy in a controlled setting. In addition, by intelligently analyzing previous medication tolerance documented in clinical notes and distinguishing between cases requiring different alert types, HELIOT can potentially reduce interruptive alerts by over 50% compared to traditional CDSSs. While these preliminary findings are encouraging, real-world validation will be essential to confirm these benefits in clinical practice.
