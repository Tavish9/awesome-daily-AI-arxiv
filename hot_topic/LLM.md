  Foundation models have demonstrated strong reasoning and generalization capabilities in driving-related tasks, including scene understanding, planning, and control. However, they still face challenges in hallucinations, uncertainty, and long inference latency. While existing foundation models have general knowledge of avoiding collisions, they often lack transportation-specific safety knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LetsPi, a physics-informed, dual-phase, knowledge-driven framework for safe, human-like trajectory planning. To prevent hallucinations and minimize uncertainty, this hybrid framework integrates Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning with physics-informed social force dynamics. LetsPi leverages the LLM to analyze driving scenes and historical information, providing appropriate parameters and target destinations (goals) for the social force model, which then generates the future trajectory. Moreover, the dual-phase architecture balances reasoning and computational efficiency through its Memory Collection phase and Fast Inference phase. The Memory Collection phase leverages the physics-informed LLM to process and refine planning results through reasoning, reflection, and memory modules, storing safe, high-quality driving experiences in a memory bank. Surrogate safety measures and physics-informed prompt techniques are introduced to enhance the LLM's knowledge of transportation safety and physical force, respectively. The Fast Inference phase extracts similar driving experiences as few-shot examples for new scenarios, while simplifying input-output requirements to enable rapid trajectory planning without compromising safety. Extensive experiments using the HighD dataset demonstrate that LetsPi outperforms baseline models across five safetythis http URLPDF for project Github link.

  Driving scenario data play an increasingly vital role in the development of intelligent vehicles and autonomous driving. Accurate and efficient scenario data search is critical for both online vehicle decision-making and planning, and offline scenario generation and simulations, as it allows for leveraging the scenario experiences to improve the overall performance. Especially with the application of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) systems in autonomous driving, urgent requirements are put forward. In this paper, we introduce the Driving-RAG framework to address the challenges of efficient scenario data embedding, search, and applications for RAG systems. Our embedding model aligns fundamental scenario information and scenario distance metrics in the vector space. The typical scenario sampling method combined with hierarchical navigable small world can perform efficient scenario vector search to achieve high efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, the reorganization mechanism by graph knowledge enhances the relevance to the prompt scenarios and augment LLM generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on typical trajectory planning task for complex interactive scenarios such as ramps and intersections, showcasing its advantages for RAG applications.

  Full integration of robots into real-life applications necessitates their ability to interpret and execute natural language directives from untrained users. Given the inherent variability in human language, equivalent directives may be phrased differently, yet require consistent robot behavior. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced language understanding, they often falter in handling user phrasing variability, rely on predefined commands, and exhibit unpredictable outputs. This letter introduces the Directive Language Model (DLM), a novel speech-to-trajectory framework that directly maps verbal commands to executable motion trajectories, bypassing predefined phrases. DLM utilizes Behavior Cloning (BC) on simulated demonstrations of human-guided robot motion. To enhance generalization, GPT-based semantic augmentation generates diverse paraphrases of training commands, labeled with the same motion trajectory. DLM further incorporates a diffusion policy-based trajectory generation for adaptive motion refinement and stochastic sampling. In contrast to LLM-based methods, DLM ensures consistent, predictable motion without extensive prompt engineering, facilitating real-time robotic guidance. As DLM learns from trajectory data, it is embodiment-agnostic, enabling deployment across diverse robotic platforms. Experimental results demonstrate DLM's improved command generalization, reduced dependence on structured phrasing, and achievement of human-like motion.

  Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) paved the way for their emerging applications in various domains, such as human behavior simulations, where LLMs could augment human-generated data in social science research and machine learning model training. However, pretrained LLMs often fail to capture the behavioral diversity of target populations due to the inherent variability across individuals and groups. To address this, we propose \textit{Mixture of Personas} (MoP), a \textit{probabilistic} prompting method that aligns the LLM responses with the target population. MoP is a contextual mixture model, where each component is an LM agent characterized by a persona and an exemplar representing subpopulation behaviors. The persona and exemplar are randomly chosen according to the learned mixing weights to elicit diverse LLM responses during simulation. MoP is flexible, requires no model finetuning, and is transferable across base models. Experiments for synthetic data generation show that MoP outperforms competing methods in alignment and diversity metrics.

- **[UNA: Unifying Alignments of RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO by a Generalized Implicit Reward Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15339)**  `arXiv:2408.15339`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Zhichao Wang, Bin Bi, Can Huang, Shiva Kumar Pentyala, Zixu James Zhu, Sitaram Asur, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  An LLM is pretrained on trillions of tokens, but the pretrained LLM may still generate undesired responses. To solve this problem, alignment techniques such as RLHF, DPO and KTO are proposed. However, these alignment techniques have limitations. For example, RLHF requires training the reward model and policy separately, which is complex, time-consuming, memory intensive and unstable during training processes. DPO proposes a mapping between an optimal policy and a reward, greatly simplifying the training process of RLHF. However, it can not take full advantages of a reward model and it is limited to pairwise preference data.In this paper, we propose \textbf{UN}ified \textbf{A}lignment (UNA) which unifies RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO. Firstly, we mathematically prove that given the classical RLHF objective, the optimal policy is induced by a generalize implicit reward function. With this novel mapping between a reward model and an optimal policy, UNA can 1. unify RLHF/PPO, DPO and KTO into a supervised learning of minimizing the difference between an implicit reward and an explicit reward; 2. outperform RLHF/PPO while simplify, stabilize, speed up and reduce memory burden of RL fine-tuning process; 3. accommodate different feedback types including pairwise, binary and scalar feedback. Downstream experiments show UNA outperforms DPO, KTO and RLHF.

- **[LagKV: Lag-Relative Information of the KV Cache Tells Which Tokens Are Important](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04704)**  `arXiv:2504.04704`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing size of the Key-Value (KV) cache during the Large Language Models long-context inference is the main obstacle for its balance between the deployment cost and task accuracy. To reduce the KV cache size in such scenarios, most previous efforts leveraged on the attention weight to evict non-critical cache tokens. But there is a trade-off in those methods, they usually require major modifiation of the inference infrastructure and significant computation overhead. Base on the fact that the Large Lanuage models are autoregresssive models, we propose {\it LagKV}, a KV allocation strategy only relying on straight forward comparison among KV themself. It is a totally attention free method which offers easy integration to the main stream inference platform and comparable performance comparing to other complicated KV compression methods. Results on LongBench and PasskeyRetrieval show that, our approach achieves nearly zero loss when the ratio is $2\times$ and $\approx 90\%$ of the original model performance for $8\times$. Especially in the 64-digit passkey retrieval task, our mehod outperforms the attention weight based method $H_2O$ over $60\%$ with same compression ratios.

- **[Learning to Reason Over Time: Timeline Self-Reflection for Improved Temporal Reasoning in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05258)**  `arXiv:2504.05258`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating coherent text, understanding context, and performing reasoning tasks. However, they struggle with temporal reasoning, which requires processing time-related information such as event sequencing, durations, and inter-temporal relationships. These capabilities are critical for applications including question answering, scheduling, and historical analysis. In this paper, we introduce TISER, a novel framework that enhances the temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs through a multi-stage process that combines timeline construction with iterative self-reflection. Our approach leverages test-time scaling to extend the length of reasoning traces, enabling models to capture complex temporal dependencies more effectively. This strategy not only boosts reasoning accuracy but also improves the traceability of the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including out-of-distribution test sets, and reveal that TISER enables smaller open-source models to surpass larger closed-weight models on challenging temporal reasoning tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Legal reasoning tasks present unique challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to the complexity of domain-specific knowledge and reasoning processes. This paper investigates how effectively smaller language models (Llama 2 7B and Llama 3 8B) can be fine-tuned with a limited dataset of 1,514 Multi-state Bar Examination (MBE) questions to improve legal question answering accuracy. We evaluate these models on the 2022 MBE questions licensed from JD Advising, the same dataset used in the 'GPT-4 passes the Bar exam' study. Our methodology involves collecting approximately 200 questions per legal domain across 7 domains. We distill the dataset using Llama 3 (70B) to transform explanations into a structured IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) format as a guided reasoning process to see if it results in better performance over the non-distilled dataset. We compare the non-fine-tuned models against their supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts, trained for different sample sizes per domain, to study the effect on accuracy and prompt adherence. We also analyse option selection biases and their mitigation following SFT. In addition, we consolidate the performance across multiple variables: prompt type (few-shot vs zero-shot), answer ordering (chosen-option first vs generated-explanation first), response format (Numbered list vs Markdown vs JSON), and different decoding temperatures. Our findings show that domain-specific SFT helps some model configurations achieve close to human baseline performance, despite limited computational resources and a relatively small dataset. We release both the gathered SFT dataset and the family of Supervised Fine-tuned (SFT) adapters optimised for MBE performance. This establishes a practical lower bound on resources needed towards achieving effective legal question answering in smaller LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computing the full Hessian matrix -- the matrix of second-order derivatives for an entire Large Language Model (LLM) is infeasible due to its sheer size. In this technical report, we aim to provide a comprehensive guide on how to accurately compute at least a small portion of the Hessian for LLMs using PyTorch autograd library. We also demonstrate how to compute the full diagonal of the Hessian matrix using multiple samples of vector-Hessian Products (HVPs). We hope that both this guide and the accompanying GitHub code will be valuable resources for practitioners and researchers interested in better understanding the behavior and structure of the Hessian in LLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly contributing to the creation of content on the Internet. This creates a feedback loop as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this generated, synthetic data. This phenomenon is receiving increasing interest, in particular because previous studies have shown that it may lead to distribution shift - models misrepresent and forget the true underlying distributions of human data they are expected to approximate (e.g. resulting in a drastic loss of quality). In this study, we study the impact of human data properties on distribution shift dynamics in iterated training loops. We first confirm that the distribution shift dynamics greatly vary depending on the human data by comparing four datasets (two based on Twitter and two on Reddit). We then test whether data quality may influence the rate of this shift. We find that it does on the twitter, but not on the Reddit datasets. We then focus on a Reddit dataset and conduct a more exhaustive evaluation of a large set of dataset properties. This experiment associated lexical diversity with larger, and semantic diversity with smaller detrimental shifts, suggesting that incorporating text with high lexical (but limited semantic) diversity could exacerbate the degradation of generated text. We then focus on the evolution of political bias, and find that the type of shift observed (bias reduction, amplification or inversion) depends on the political lean of the human (true) distribution. Overall, our work extends the existing literature on the consequences of recursive fine-tuning by showing that this phenomenon is highly dependent on features of the human data on which training occurs. This suggests that different parts of internet (e.g. GitHub, Reddit) may undergo different types of shift depending on their properties.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present M2-omni, a cutting-edge, open-source omni-MLLM that achieves competitive performance to GPT-4o. M2-omni employs a unified multimodal sequence modeling framework, which empowers Large Language Models(LLMs) to acquire comprehensive cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities. Specifically, M2-omni can process arbitrary combinations of audio, video, image, and text modalities as input, generating multimodal sequences interleaving with audio, image, or text outputs, thereby enabling an advanced and interactive real-time experience. The training of such an omni-MLLM is challenged by significant disparities in data quantity and convergence rates across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a step balance strategy during pre-training to handle the quantity disparities in modality-specific data. Additionally, a dynamically adaptive balance strategy is introduced during the instruction tuning stage to synchronize the modality-wise training progress, ensuring optimal convergence. Notably, we prioritize preserving strong performance on pure text tasks to maintain the robustness of M2-omni's language understanding capability throughout the training process. To our best knowledge, M2-omni is currently a very competitive open-source model to GPT-4o, characterized by its comprehensive modality and task support, as well as its exceptional performance. We expect M2-omni will advance the development of omni-MLLMs, thus facilitating future research in this domain.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While many EDA tasks already involve graph-based data, existing LLMs in EDA primarily either represent graphs as sequential text, or simply ignore graph-structured data that might be beneficial like dataflow graphs of RTL code. Recent studies have found that LLM performance suffers when graphs are represented as sequential text, and using additional graph information significantly boosts performance. To address these challenges, we introduce BRIDGES, a framework designed to incorporate graph modality into LLMs for EDA tasks. BRIDGES integrates an automated data generation workflow, a solution that combines graph modality with LLM, and a comprehensive evaluation suite. First, we establish an LLM-driven workflow to generate RTL and netlist-level data, converting them into dataflow and netlist graphs with function descriptions. This workflow yields a large-scale dataset comprising over 500,000 graph instances and more than 1.5 billion tokens. Second, we propose a lightweight cross-modal projector that encodes graph representations into text-compatible prompts, enabling LLMs to effectively utilize graph data without architectural modifications. Experimental results demonstrate 2x to 10x improvements across multiple tasks compared to text-only baselines, including accuracy in design retrieval, type prediction and perplexity in function description, with negligible computational overhead (<1% model weights increase and <30% additional runtime overhead). Even without additional LLM finetuning, our results outperform text-only by a large margin. We plan to release BRIDGES, including the dataset, models, and training flow.

  Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved, approaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) while benefiting from large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance Human Alignment (HA) and Reasoning. Recent reward-based optimization algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have achieved significant performance on reasoning tasks, whereas preference-based optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) significantly improve the performance of LLMs on human alignment. However, despite the strong performance of reward-based optimization methods in alignment tasks , they remain vulnerable to reward hacking. Furthermore, preference-based algorithms (such as Online DPO) haven't yet matched the performance of reward-based optimization algorithms (like PPO) on reasoning tasks, making their exploration in this specific area still a worthwhile pursuit. Motivated by these challenges, we propose the Trust Region Preference Approximation (TRPA) algorithm, which integrates rule-based optimization with preference-based optimization for reasoning tasks. As a preference-based algorithm, TRPA naturally eliminates the reward hacking issue. TRPA constructs preference levels using predefined rules, forms corresponding preference pairs, and leverages a novel optimization algorithm for RL training with a theoretical monotonic improvement guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that TRPA not only achieves competitive performance on reasoning tasks but also exhibits robust stability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The existing Text-to-SQL models suffer from a shortage of training data, inhibiting their ability to fully facilitate the applications of SQL queries in new domains. To address this challenge, various data synthesis techniques have been employed to generate more diverse and higher quality data. In this paper, we propose REFORMER, a framework that leverages ChatGPT's prowess without the need for additional training, to facilitate the synthesis of (question, SQL query) pairs tailored to new domains. Our data augmentation approach is based on a "retrieve-and-edit" method, where we generate new questions by filling masked question using explanation of SQL queries with the help of ChatGPT. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cycle consistency remains a valuable method of validation when applied appropriately. Our experimental results show that REFORMER consistently outperforms previous data augmentation methods. To further investigate the power of ChatGPT and create a general data augmentation method, we also generate the new data by paraphrasing the question in the dataset and by paraphrasing the description of a new SQL query that is generated by ChatGPT as well. Our results affirm that paraphrasing questions generated by ChatGPT help augment the original data.

  Geospatial Copilots hold immense potential for automating Earth observation (EO) and climate monitoring workflows, yet their reliance on large-scale models such as GPT-4o introduces a paradox: tools intended for sustainability studies often incur unsustainable costs. Using agentic AI frameworks in geospatial applications can amass thousands of dollars in API charges or requires expensive, power-intensive GPUs for deployment, creating barriers for researchers, policymakers, and NGOs. Unfortunately, when geospatial Copilots are deployed with open language models (OLMs), performance often degrades due to their dependence on GPT-optimized logic. In this paper, we present Geo-OLM, a tool-augmented geospatial agent that leverages the novel paradigm of state-driven LLM reasoning to decouple task progression from tool calling. By alleviating the workflow reasoning burden, our approach enables low-resource OLMs to complete geospatial tasks more effectively. When downsizing to small models below 7B parameters, Geo-OLM outperforms the strongest prior geospatial baselines by 32.8% in successful query completion rates. Our method performs comparably to proprietary models achieving results within 10% of GPT-4o, while reducing inference costs by two orders of magnitude from \$500-\$1000 to under \$10. We present an in-depth analysis with geospatial downstream benchmarks, providing key insights to help practitioners effectively deploy OLMs for EO applications.

  LLMs have gained immense popularity among researchers and the general public for its impressive capabilities on a variety of tasks. Notably, the efficacy of LLMs remains significantly dependent on the quality and structure of the input prompts, making prompt design a critical factor for their performance. Recent advancements in automated prompt optimization have introduced diverse techniques that automatically enhance prompts to better align model outputs with user expectations. However, these methods often suffer from the lack of standardization and compatibility across different techniques, limited flexibility in customization, inconsistent performance across model scales, and they often exclusively rely on expensive proprietary LLM APIs. To fill in this gap, we introduce GREATERPROMPT, a novel framework that democratizes prompt optimization by unifying diverse methods under a unified, customizable API while delivering highly effective prompts for different tasks. Our framework flexibly accommodates various model scales by leveraging both text feedback-based optimization for larger LLMs and internal gradient-based optimization for smaller models to achieve powerful and precise prompt improvements. Moreover, we provide a user-friendly Web UI that ensures accessibility for non-expert users, enabling broader adoption and enhanced performance across various user groups and application scenarios. GREATERPROMPT is available atthis https URLvia GitHub, PyPI, and web user interfaces.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various tasks, such as decision-making, reasoning, and question answering. They have been widely used in edge devices. However, fine-tuning LLMs to specific tasks at the edge is challenging due to the high computational cost and the limited storage and energy resources at the edge. To address this issue, we propose TaskEdge, a task-aware parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework at the edge, which allocates the most effective parameters to the target task and only updates the task-specific parameters. Specifically, we first design a parameter importance calculation criterion that incorporates both weights and input activations into the computation of weight importance. Then, we propose a model-agnostic task-specific parameter allocation algorithm to ensure that task-specific parameters are distributed evenly across the model, rather than being concentrated in specific regions. In doing so, TaskEdge can significantly reduce the computational cost and memory usage while maintaining performance on the target downstream tasks by updating less than 0.1\% of the parameters. In addition, TaskEdge can be easily integrated with structured sparsity to enable acceleration by NVIDIA's specialized sparse tensor cores, and it can be seamlessly integrated with LoRA to enable efficient sparse low-rank adaptation. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TaskEdge.

  Post-training Quantization (PTQ) has become a widely used technique for improving inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, existing PTQ methods generally suffer from crucial limitations such as heavy calibration data requirements and inflexible choice of target number of bits. In this paper, we propose RaanA, a unified PTQ framework that overcomes these challenges by introducing two novel components: 1) RaBitQ-H, a variant of a randomized vector quantization method RaBitQ, designed for fast, accurate, and highly efficient quantization; and 2) AllocateBits, an algorithm that optimally allocates bit-widths across layers based on their quantization sensitivity. RaanA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art quantization methods while being extremely fast, requiring minimal calibration data, and enabling flexible bit allocation. Extensive experiments demonstrate RaanA's efficacy in balancing efficiency and accuracy. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to specialize in downstream tasks, with the Cross Entropy (CE) loss being the de facto choice. However, CE maximizes the likelihood of observed data without accounting for alternative possibilities. As such, CE usually leads to reduced diversity in the model's outputs, which hinders further development that requires sampling to explore better responses. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a new game-theoretic formulation for SFT. In this framework, an auxiliary variable is introduced to regulate the learning process. We prove that the proposed game-theoretic approach connects to the problem of reverse KL minimization with entropy regularization. This regularization prevents over-memorization of training data and promotes output diversity. To implement this framework, we develop GEM, a new training algorithm that is computationally efficient as CE by leveraging some unique properties of LLMs. Empirical studies of pre-trained models from 3B to 70B parameters show that GEM achieves comparable downstream performance to CE while significantly enhancing output diversity. This increased diversity translates to performance gains in test-time compute scaling for chat and code generation tasks. Moreover, we observe that preserving output diversity has the added benefit of mitigating forgetting, as maintaining diverse outputs encourages models to retain pre-trained knowledge throughout the training process.

  Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a important paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences during post-training. This framework typically involves two stages: first, training a reward model on human preference data, followed by optimizing the language model using reinforcement learning algorithms. However, current RLHF approaches may constrained by two limitations. First, existing RLHF frameworks often rely on Bradley-Terry models to assign scalar rewards based on pairwise comparisons of individual responses. However, this approach imposes significant challenges on reward model (RM), as the inherent variability in prompt-response pairs across different contexts demands robust calibration capabilities from the RM. Second, reward models are typically initialized from generative foundation models, such as pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned models, despite the fact that reward models perform discriminative tasks, creating a mismatch. This paper introduces Pairwise-RL, a RLHF framework that addresses these challenges through a combination of generative reward modeling and a pairwise proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Pairwise-RL unifies reward model training and its application during reinforcement learning within a consistent pairwise paradigm, leveraging generative modeling techniques to enhance reward model performance and score calibration. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Pairwise-RL outperforms traditional RLHF frameworks across both internal evaluation datasets and standard public benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in improving alignment and model behavior.

Due to the vast volume of logs, automated log parsing is essential to transform semi-structured log messages into structured representations. Traditional log parsing techniques often require manual configurations, such as defining log formats or labeling data, which limits scalability and usability. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced the new research field of LLM-based log parsing, offering potential improvements in automation and adaptability. Despite promising results, there is no structured overview of these approaches since this is a relatively new research field with the earliest advances published in late 2023. This paper systematically reviews 29 LLM-based log parsing methods, comparing their capabilities, limitations, and reliance on manual effort. We analyze the learning and prompt-engineering paradigms employed, efficiency- and effectiveness-enhancing techniques, and the role of LLMs in the parsing process. We aggregate the results of the survey in a large table comprising the characterizing features of LLM-based log parsing approaches and derive the general process of LLM-based log parsing, incorporating all reviewed approaches in a single flow chart. Additionally, we benchmark seven open-source LLM-based log parsers on public datasets and critically assess their reproducibility. Our findings summarize the advances of this new research field and provide insights for researchers and practitioners seeking efficient and user-friendly log parsing solutions, with all code and results made publicly available for transparency.

  Automated Program Repair tools are developed for generating feedback and suggesting a repair method for erroneous code. State of the art (SOTA) code repair methods rely on data-driven approaches and often fail to deliver solution for complicated programming questions. To interpret the natural language of unprecedented programming problems, using Large Language Models (LLMs) for code-feedback generation is crucial. LLMs generate more comprehensible feedback than compiler-generated error messages, and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) further enhances quality by integrating human-in-the-loop which helps novice students to lean programming from scratch interactively. We are applying RLHF fine-tuning technique for an expected Socratic response such as a question with hint to solve the programming issue. We are proposing code feedback generation tool by fine-tuning LLM with RLHF, Automated Code Evaluation with RLHF (ACE-RLHF), combining two open-source LLM models with two different SOTA optimization techniques. The quality of feedback is evaluated on two benchmark datasets containing basic and competition-level programming questions where the later is proposed by us. We achieved 2-5% higher accuracy than RL-free SOTA techniques using Llama-3-7B-Proximal-policy optimization in automated evaluation and similar or slightly higher accuracy compared to reward model-free RL with AI Feedback (RLAIF). We achieved almost 40% higher accuracy with GPT-3.5 Best-of-n optimization while performing manual evaluation.

  Approximate unlearning has gained popularity as an approach to efficiently update an LLM so that it behaves (roughly) as if it was not trained on a subset of data to begin with. However, existing methods are brittle in practice and can easily be attacked to reveal supposedly unlearned information. To alleviate issues with approximate unlearning, we instead propose SIFT-Masks (SIgn-Fixed Tuning-Masks), an exact unlearning method based on model merging. SIFT-Masks addresses two key limitations of standard model merging: (1) merging a large number of tasks can severely harm utility; and (2) methods that boost utility by sharing extra information across tasks make exact unlearning prohibitively expensive. SIFT-Masks solves these issues by (1) applying local masks to recover task-specific performance; and (2) constraining finetuning to align with a global sign vector as a lightweight approach to determine masks independently before merging. Across four settings where we merge up to 500 models, SIFT-Masks improves accuracy by 5-80% over naive merging and uses up to 250x less compute for exact unlearning compared to other merging baselines.

  Competitive Pok√©mon Singles (CPS) is a popular strategy game where players learn to exploit their opponent based on imperfect information in battles that can last more than one hundred stochastic turns. AI research in CPS has been led by heuristic tree search and online self-play, but the game may also create a platform to study adaptive policies trained offline on large datasets. We develop a pipeline to reconstruct the first-person perspective of an agent from logs saved from the third-person perspective of a spectator, thereby unlocking a dataset of real human battles spanning more than a decade that grows larger every day. This dataset enables a black-box approach where we train large sequence models to adapt to their opponent based solely on their input trajectory while selecting moves without explicit search of any kind. We study a progression from imitation learning to offline RL and offline fine-tuning on self-play data in the hardcore competitive setting of Pok√©mon's four oldest (and most partially observed) game generations. The resulting agents outperform a recent LLM Agent approach and a strong heuristic search engine. While playing anonymously in online battles against humans, our best agents climb to rankings inside the top 10% of active players.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-head attention is foundational to large language models (LLMs), enabling different heads to have diverse focus on relevant input tokens. However, learned behaviors like attention sinks, where the first token receives most attention despite limited semantic importance, challenge our understanding of multi-head attention. To analyze this phenomenon, we propose a new definition for attention heads dominated by attention sinks, known as dormant attention heads. We compare our definition to prior work in a model intervention study where we test whether dormant heads matter for inference by zeroing out the output of dormant attention heads. Using six pretrained models and five benchmark datasets, we find our definition to be more model and dataset-agnostic. Using our definition on most models, more than 4% of a model's attention heads can be zeroed while maintaining average accuracy, and zeroing more than 14% of a model's attention heads can keep accuracy to within 1% of the pretrained model's average accuracy. Further analysis reveals that dormant heads emerge early in pretraining and can transition between dormant and active states during pretraining. Additionally, we provide evidence that they depend on characteristics of the input text.

  Formative assessment in STEM topics aims to promote student learning by identifying students' current understanding, thus targeting how to promote further learning. Previous studies suggest that the assessment performance of current generative large language models (LLMs) on constructed responses to open-ended questions is significantly lower than that of supervised classifiers trained on high-quality labeled data. However, we demonstrate that concept-based rubrics can significantly enhance LLM performance, which narrows the gap between LLMs as off-the shelf assessment tools, and smaller supervised models, which need large amounts of training data. For datasets where concept-based rubrics allow LLMs to achieve strong performance, we show that the concept-based rubrics help the same LLMs generate high quality synthetic data for training lightweight, high-performance supervised models. Our experiments span diverse STEM student response datasets with labels of varying quality, including a new real-world dataset that contains some AI-assisted responses, which introduces additional considerations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Crowd and flow predictions have been extensively studied in mobility data science. Traditional forecasting methods have relied on statistical models such as ARIMA, later supplemented by deep learning approaches like ST-ResNet. More recently, foundation models for time series forecasting, such as TimeGPT, Chronos, and LagLlama, have emerged. A key advantage of these models is their ability to generate zero-shot predictions, allowing them to be applied directly to new tasks without retraining. This study evaluates the performance of TimeGPT compared to traditional approaches for predicting city-wide mobility timeseries using two bike-sharing datasets from New York City and Vienna, Austria. Model performance is assessed across short (1-hour), medium (12-hour), and long-term (24-hour) forecasting horizons. The results highlight the potential of foundation models for mobility forecasting while also identifying limitations of our experiments.

Methods included in our study include: LLM-as-a-Judge, Prometheus, Lynx, the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), and the Trustworthy Language Model (TLM). These approaches are all reference-free, requiring no ground-truth answers/labels to catch incorrect LLM responses.

  Learning open-vocabulary physical skills for simulated agents presents a significant challenge in artificial intelligence. Current reinforcement learning approaches face critical limitations: manually designed rewards lack scalability across diverse tasks, while demonstration-based methods struggle to generalize beyond their training distribution. We introduce GROVE, a generalized reward framework that enables open-vocabulary physical skill learning without manual engineering or task-specific demonstrations. Our key insight is that Large Language Models(LLMs) and Vision Language Models(VLMs) provide complementary guidance -- LLMs generate precise physical constraints capturing task requirements, while VLMs evaluate motion semantics and naturalness. Through an iterative design process, VLM-based feedback continuously refines LLM-generated constraints, creating a self-improving reward system. To bridge the domain gap between simulation and natural images, we develop Pose2CLIP, a lightweight mapper that efficiently projects agent poses directly into semantic feature space without computationally expensive rendering. Extensive experiments across diverse embodiments and learning paradigms demonstrate GROVE's effectiveness, achieving 22.2% higher motion naturalness and 25.7% better task completion scores while training 8.4x faster than previous methods. These results establish a new foundation for scalable physical skill acquisition in simulated environments.

  With the growing sizes of AI models like large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers, deploying them on devices with limited computational resources is a significant challenge particularly when addressing domain generalisation (DG) tasks. This paper introduces a novel grouped structural pruning method for pre-trained vision transformers (ViT, BeiT, and DeiT), evaluated on the PACS and Office-Home DG benchmarks. Our method uses dependency graph analysis to identify and remove redundant groups of neurons, weights, filters, or attention heads within transformers, using a range of selection metrics. Grouped structural pruning is applied at pruning ratios of 50\%, 75\% and 95\% and the models are then fine-tuned on selected distributions from DG benchmarks to evaluate their overall performance in DG tasks. Results show significant improvements in inference speed and fine-tuning time with minimal trade-offs in accuracy and DG task performance. For instance, on the PACS benchmark, pruning ViT, BeiT, and DeiT models by 50\% using the Hessian metric resulted in accuracy drops of only -2.94\%, -1.42\%, and -1.72\%, respectively, while achieving speed boosts of 2.5x, 1.81x, and 2.15x. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in balancing model efficiency with domain generalisation performance.

  Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the 3D physical world is an emerging yet challenging research direction. Current strategies for processing point clouds typically downsample the scene or divide it into smaller parts for separate analysis. However, both approaches risk losing key local details or global contextual information. In this paper, we introduce PerLA, a 3D language assistant designed to be more perceptive to both details and context, making visual representations more informative for the LLM. PerLA captures high-resolution (local) details in parallel from different point cloud areas and integrates them with (global) context obtained from a lower-resolution whole point cloud. We present a novel algorithm that preserves point cloud locality through the Hilbert curve and effectively aggregates local-to-global information via cross-attention and a graph neural network. Lastly, we introduce a novel loss for local representation consensus to promote training stability. PerLA outperforms state-of-the-art 3D language assistants, with gains of up to +1.34 CiDEr on ScanQA for question answering, and +4.22 on ScanRefer and +3.88 on Nr3D for dense captioning.this https URL

Despite excellent performance on textual problems, models with tools like search engines still show significant gaps when addressing visual questions requiring latest visual knowledge, highlighting important areas for future research.

  Redundancy of visual tokens in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) significantly reduces their computational efficiency. Recent approaches, such as resamplers and summarizers, have sought to reduce the number of visual tokens, but at the cost of visual reasoning ability. To address this, we propose LEO-MINI, a novel MLLM that significantly reduces the number of visual tokens and simultaneously boosts visual reasoning capabilities. For efficiency, LEO-MINI incorporates CoTR, a novel token reduction module to consolidate a large number of visual tokens into a smaller set of tokens, using the similarity between visual tokens, text tokens, and a compact learnable query. For effectiveness, to scale up the model's ability with minimal computational overhead, LEO-MINI employs MMoE, a novel mixture of multi-modal experts module. MMOE employs a set of LoRA experts with a novel router to switch between them based on the input text and visual tokens instead of only using the input hidden state. MMoE also includes a general LoRA expert that is always activated to learn general knowledge for LLM reasoning. For extracting richer visual features, MMOE employs a set of vision experts trained on diverse domain-specific data. To demonstrate LEO-MINI's improved efficiency and performance, we evaluate it against existing efficient MLLMs on various benchmark vision-language tasks.

  We propose Fuzzy Group Relative Policy Reward (FGRPR), a novel framework that integrates Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fuzzy reward function to enhance learning efficiency. Unlike the conventional binary 0/1 accuracy reward, our fuzzy reward model provides nuanced incentives, encouraging more precise outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that GRPO with a standard 0/1 accuracy reward underperforms compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In contrast, FGRPR, applied to Qwen2.5-VL(3B and 7B), surpasses all baseline models, including GPT4o, LLaMA2(90B), and SFT, across five in-domain datasets. On an out-of-domain dataset, FGRPR achieves performance comparable to SFT but excels when target values are larger, as its fuzzy reward function assigns higher rewards to closer approximations. This approach is broadly applicable to tasks where the precision of the answer is critical. Code and data:this https URL

  Egocentric Video Question Answering (QA) requires models to handle long-horizon temporal reasoning, first-person perspectives, and specialized challenges like frequent camera movement. This paper systematically evaluates both proprietary and open-source Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on QaEgo4Dv2 - a refined dataset of egocentric videos derived from QaEgo4D. Four popular MLLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Video-LLaVa-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct) are assessed using zero-shot and fine-tuned approaches for both OpenQA and CloseQA settings. We introduce QaEgo4Dv2 to mitigate annotation noise in QaEgo4D, enabling more reliable comparison. Our results show that fine-tuned Video-LLaVa-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct achieve new state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous benchmarks by up to +2.6% ROUGE/METEOR (for OpenQA) and +13% accuracy (for CloseQA). We also present a thorough error analysis, indicating the model's difficulty in spatial reasoning and fine-grained object recognition - key areas for future improvement.

  There exist many methods to explain how an image classification model generates its decision, but very little work has explored methods to explain why a classifier might lack confidence in its prediction. As there are various reasons the classifier might lose confidence, it would be valuable for this model to not only indicate its level of uncertainty but also explain why it is uncertain. Counterfactual images have been used to visualize changes that could be made to an image to generate a different classification decision. In this work, we explore the use of counterfactuals to offer an explanation for low model competency--a generalized form of predictive uncertainty that measures confidence. Toward this end, we develop five novel methods to generate high-competency counterfactual images, namely Image Gradient Descent (IGD), Feature Gradient Descent (FGD), Autoencoder Reconstruction (Reco), Latent Gradient Descent (LGD), and Latent Nearest Neighbors (LNN). We evaluate these methods across two unique datasets containing images with six known causes for low model competency and find Reco, LGD, and LNN to be the most promising methods for counterfactual generation. We further evaluate how these three methods can be utilized by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate language explanations for low model competency. We find that the inclusion of a counterfactual image in the language model query greatly increases the ability of the model to generate an accurate explanation for the cause of low model competency, thus demonstrating the utility of counterfactual images in explaining low perception model competency.

  Motivated by recent improvements in generative AI and wearable camera devices (e.g. smart glasses and AI-enabled pins), I investigate the ability of foundation models to learn about the wearer's personal life through first-person camera data. To test this, I wore a camera headset for 54 hours over the course of a week, generated summaries of various lengths (e.g. minute-long, hour-long, and day-long summaries), and fine-tuned both GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini on the resulting summary hierarchy. By querying the fine-tuned models, we are able to learn what the models learned about me. The results are mixed: Both models learned basic information about me (e.g. approximate age, gender). Moreover, GPT-4o correctly deduced that I live in Pittsburgh, am a PhD student at CMU, am right-handed, and have a pet cat. However, both models also suffered from hallucination and would make up names for the individuals present in the video footage of my life.

  Visual instruction tuning (VIT) for large vision-language models (LVLMs) requires training on expansive datasets of image-instruction pairs, which can be costly. Recent efforts in VIT data selection aim to select a small subset of high-quality image-instruction pairs, reducing VIT runtime while maintaining performance comparable to full-scale training. However, a major challenge often overlooked is that generating instructions from unlabeled images for VIT is highly expensive. Most existing VIT datasets rely heavily on human annotations or paid services like the GPT API, which limits users with constrained resources from creating VIT datasets for custom applications. To address this, we introduce Pre-Instruction Data Selection (PreSel), a more practical data selection paradigm that directly selects the most beneficial unlabeled images and generates instructions only for the selected images. PreSel first estimates the relative importance of each vision task within VIT datasets to derive task-wise sampling budgets. It then clusters image features within each task, selecting the most representative images with the budget. This approach reduces computational overhead for both instruction generation during VIT data formation and LVLM fine-tuning. By generating instructions for only 15% of the images, PreSel achieves performance comparable to full-data VIT on the LLaVA-1.5 and Vision-Flan datasets. The link to our project page:this https URL

  Despite the existing evolution of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a non-neglectable limitation remains in their struggle with visual text grounding, especially in text-rich images of documents. Document images, such as scanned forms and infographics, highlight critical challenges due to their complex layouts and textual content. However, current benchmarks do not fully address these challenges, as they mostly focus on visual grounding on natural images, rather than text-rich document images. Thus, to bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG, a novel task with a newly designed instruction dataset for benchmarking and improving the Text-Rich Image Grounding capabilities of MLLMs in document question-answering. Specifically, we propose an OCR-LLM-human interaction pipeline to create 800 manually annotated question-answer pairs as a benchmark and a large-scale training set of 90$ synthetic data based on four diverse datasets. A comprehensive evaluation of various MLLMs on our proposed benchmark exposes substantial limitations in their grounding capability on text-rich images. In addition, we propose two simple and effective TRIG methods based on general instruction tuning and plug-and-play efficient embedding, respectively. By finetuning MLLMs on our synthetic dataset, they promisingly improve spatial reasoning and grounding capabilities.

  Despite strong performance on vision-language tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with mathematical problem-solving, with both open-source and state-of-the-art models falling short of human performance on visual-math benchmarks. To systematically examine visual-mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, we (1) evaluate their understanding of geometric primitives, (2) test multi-step reasoning, and (3) explore a potential solution to improve visual reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental shortcomings in shape recognition, with top models achieving under 50% accuracy in identifying regular polygons. We analyze these failures through the lens of dual-process theory and show that MLLMs rely on System 1 (intuitive, memorized associations) rather than System 2 (deliberate reasoning). Consequently, MLLMs fail to count the sides of both familiar and novel shapes, suggesting they have neither learned the concept of sides nor effectively process visual inputs. Finally, we propose Visually Cued Chain-of-Thought (VC-CoT) prompting, which enhances multi-step mathematical reasoning by explicitly referencing visual annotations in diagrams, boosting GPT-4o's accuracy on an irregular polygon side-counting task from 7% to 93%. Our findings suggest that System 2 reasoning in MLLMs remains an open problem, and visually-guided prompting is essential for successfully engaging visual reasoning. Code available at:this https URL.

  Region-level captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for specific image regions while highlighting their distinguishing features. However, existing methods struggle to produce unique captions across multi-granularity, limiting their real-world applicability. To address the need for detailed region-level understanding, we introduce URECA dataset, a large-scale dataset tailored for multi-granularity region captioning. Unlike prior datasets that focus primarily on salient objects, URECA dataset ensures a unique and consistent mapping between regions and captions by incorporating a diverse set of objects, parts, and background elements. Central to this is a stage-wise data curation pipeline, where each stage incrementally refines region selection and caption generation. By leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, our pipeline produces distinctive and contextually grounded captions with improved accuracy and semantic diversity. Building upon this dataset, we present URECA, a novel captioning model designed to effectively encode multi-granularity regions. URECA maintains essential spatial properties such as position and shape through simple yet impactful modifications to existing MLLMs, enabling fine-grained and semantically rich region descriptions. Our approach introduces dynamic mask modeling and a high-resolution mask encoder to enhance caption uniqueness. Experiments show that URECA achieves state-of-the-art performance on URECA dataset and generalizes well to existing region-level captioning benchmarks.

  Video generation assessment is essential for ensuring that generative models produce visually realistic, high-quality videos while aligning with human expectations. Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main categories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to evaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack alignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based benchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a limited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency. To address these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with human preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions. This benchmark represents the first attempt to systematically leverage MLLMs across all dimensions relevant to video generation assessment in generative models. By incorporating few-shot scoring and chain-of-query techniques, Video-Bench provides a structured, scalable approach to generated video evaluation. Experiments on advanced models including Sora demonstrate that Video-Bench achieves superior alignment with human preferences across all dimensions. Moreover, in instances where our framework's assessments diverge from human evaluations, it consistently offers more objective and accurate insights, suggesting an even greater potential advantage over traditional human judgment.

  Typographic attacks exploit the interplay between text and visual content in multimodal foundation models, causing misclassifications when misleading text is embedded within images. However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. We publicly release the datasets introduced in this paper underthis https URL, along with the code for evaluations atthis https URL.

  Compositionality, or correctly recognizing scenes as compositions of atomic visual concepts, remains difficult for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Even state of the art MLLMs such as GPT-4o can make mistakes in distinguishing compositions like "dog chasing cat" vs "cat chasing dog". While on Winoground, a benchmark for measuring such reasoning, MLLMs have made significant progress, they are still far from a human's performance. We show that compositional reasoning in these models can be improved by elucidating such concepts via data, where a model is trained to prefer the correct caption for an image over a close but incorrect one. We introduce SCRAMBLe: Synthetic Compositional Reasoning Augmentation of MLLMs with Binary preference Learning, an approach for preference tuning open-weight MLLMs on synthetic preference data generated in a fully automated manner from existing image-caption data. SCRAMBLe holistically improves these MLLMs' compositional reasoning capabilities which we can see through significant improvements across multiple vision language compositionality benchmarks, as well as smaller but significant improvements on general question answering tasks. As a sneak peek, SCRAMBLe tuned Molmo-7B model improves on Winoground from 49.5% to 54.8% (best reported to date), while improving by ~1% on more general visual question answering tasks. Code for SCRAMBLe along with tuned models and our synthetic training dataset is available atthis https URL.

  3D Large Language Models (LLMs) leveraging spatial information in point clouds for 3D spatial reasoning attract great attention. Despite some promising results, the role of point clouds in 3D spatial reasoning remains under-explored. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate and analyze these models to answer the research question: \textit{Does point cloud truly boost the spatial reasoning capacities of 3D LLMs?} We first evaluate the spatial reasoning capacity of LLMs with different input modalities by replacing the point cloud with the visual and text counterparts. We then propose a novel 3D QA (Question-answering) benchmark, ScanReQA, that comprehensively evaluates models' understanding of binary spatial relationships. Our findings reveal several critical insights: 1) LLMs without point input could even achieve competitive performance even in a zero-shot manner; 2) existing 3D LLMs struggle to comprehend the binary spatial relationships; 3) 3D LLMs exhibit limitations in exploiting the structural coordinates in point clouds for fine-grained spatial reasoning. We think these conclusions can help the next step of 3D LLMs and also offer insights for foundation models in other modalities. We release datasets and reproducible codes in the anonymous project page:this https URL.

  Despite progress in video large language models (Video-LLMs), research on instructional video understanding, crucial for enhancing access to instructional content, remains insufficient. To address this, we introduce InstructionBench, an Instructional video understanding Benchmark, which challenges models' advanced temporal reasoning within instructional videos characterized by their strict step-by-step flow. Employing GPT-4, we formulate Q\&A pairs in open-ended and multiple-choice formats to assess both Coarse-Grained event-level and Fine-Grained object-level reasoning. Our filtering strategies exclude questions answerable purely by common-sense knowledge, focusing on visual perception and analysis when evaluating Video-LLM models. The benchmark finally contains 5k questions across over 700 videos. We evaluate the latest Video-LLMs on our InstructionBench, finding that closed-source models outperform open-source ones. However, even the best model, GPT-4o, achieves only 53.42\% accuracy, indicating significant gaps in temporal reasoning. To advance the field, we also develop a comprehensive instructional video dataset with over 19k Q\&A pairs from nearly 2.5k videos, using an automated data generation framework, thereby enriching the community's research resources.

  Despite the remarkable progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they continue to face challenges in achieving competitive performance on ordinal regression (OR; a.k.a. ordinal classification). To address this issue, this paper presents OrderChain, a novel and general prompting paradigm that improves the ordinal understanding ability of MLLMs by specificity and commonality modeling. Specifically, our OrderChain consists of a set of task-aware prompts to facilitate the specificity modeling of diverse OR tasks and a new range optimization Chain-of-Thought (RO-CoT), which learns a commonality way of thinking about OR tasks by uniformly decomposing them into multiple small-range optimization subtasks. Further, we propose a category recursive division (CRD) method to generate instruction candidate category prompts to support RO-CoT automatic optimization. Comprehensive experiments show that a Large Language and Vision Assistant (LLaVA) model with our OrderChain improves baseline LLaVA significantly on diverse OR datasets, e.g., from 47.5% to 93.2% accuracy on the Adience dataset for age estimation, and from 30.0% to 85.7% accuracy on the Diabetic Retinopathy dataset. Notably, LLaVA with our OrderChain also remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 27% on accuracy and 0.24 on MAE on the Adience dataset. To our best knowledge, our OrderChain is the first work that augments MLLMs for OR tasks, and the effectiveness is witnessed across a spectrum of OR datasets.

  Comprehending occluded objects are not well studied in existing large-scale visual-language multi-modal models. Current state-of-the-art multi-modal large models struggles to provide satisfactory results in understanding occluded objects through universal visual encoders and supervised learning strategies. Therefore, we propose OCC-MLLM-CoT-Alpha, a multi-modal large vision language framework that integrates 3D-aware supervision and Chain-of-Thoughts guidance. Particularly, (1) we build a multi-modal large vision-language model framework which is consisted of a large multi-modal vision-language model and a 3D reconstruction expert model. (2) the corresponding multi-modal Chain-of-Thoughts is learned through a combination of supervised and reinforcement training strategies, allowing the multi-modal vision-language model to enhance the recognition ability with learned multi-modal chain-of-thoughts guidance. (3) A large-scale multi-modal chain-of-thoughts reasoning dataset, consisting of $110k$ samples of occluded objects held in hand, is built. In the evaluation, the proposed methods demonstrate decision score improvement of 15.75%,15.30%,16.98%,14.62%, and 4.42%,3.63%,6.94%,10.70% for two settings of a variety of state-of-the-art models.

  LLM-driven autonomous agents have emerged as a promising direction in recent years. However, many of these LLM agents are designed empirically or based on intuition, often lacking systematic design principles, which results in diverse agent structures with limited generality and scalability. In this paper, we advocate for building LLM agents by incorporating insights from computer systems. Inspired by the von Neumann architecture, we propose a structured framework for LLM agentic systems, emphasizing modular design and universal principles. Specifically, this paper first provides a comprehensive review of LLM agents from the computer system perspective, then identifies key challenges and future directions inspired by computer system design, and finally explores the learning mechanisms for LLM agents beyond the computer system. The insights gained from this comparative analysis offer a foundation for systematic LLM agent design and advancement.

  Long video understanding has emerged as an increasingly important yet challenging task in computer vision. Agent-based approaches are gaining popularity for processing long videos, as they can handle extended sequences and integrate various tools to capture fine-grained information. However, existing methods still face several challenges: (1) they often rely solely on the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) without dedicated mechanisms to enhance reasoning in long video scenarios; and (2) they remain vulnerable to errors or noise from external tools. To address these issues, we propose a specialized chain-of-thought (CoT) process tailored for long video analysis. Our proposed CoT with plan-adjust mode enables the LLM to incrementally plan and adapt its information-gathering strategy. We further incorporate heuristic uncertainty estimation of both the LLM and external tools to guide the CoT process. This allows the LLM to assess the reliability of newly collected information, refine its collection strategy, and make more robust decisions when synthesizing final answers. Empirical experiments show that our uncertainty-aware CoT effectively mitigates noise from external tools, leading to more reliable outputs. We implement our approach in a system called VideoAgent2, which also includes additional modules such as general context acquisition and specialized tool design. Evaluation on three dedicated long video benchmarks (and their subsets) demonstrates that VideoAgent2 outperforms the previous state-of-the-art agent-based method, VideoAgent, by an average of 13.1% and achieves leading performance among all zero-shot approaches

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The challenge of Domain Generalization (DG) in Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is the significant interference of domain-specific signals on subtle spoofing clues. Recently, some CLIP-based algorithms have been developed to alleviate this interference by adjusting the weights of visual classifiers. However, our analysis of this class-wise prompt engineering suffers from two shortcomings for DG FAS: (1) The categories of facial categories, such as real or spoof, have no semantics for the CLIP model, making it difficult to learn accurate category descriptions. (2) A single form of prompt cannot portray the various types of spoofing. In this work, instead of class-wise prompts, we propose a novel Content-aware Composite Prompt Engineering (CCPE) that generates instance-wise composite prompts, including both fixed template and learnable prompts. Specifically, our CCPE constructs content-aware prompts from two branches: (1) Inherent content prompt explicitly benefits from abundant transferred knowledge from the instruction-based Large Language Model (LLM). (2) Learnable content prompts implicitly extract the most informative visual content via Q-Former. Moreover, we design a Cross-Modal Guidance Module (CGM) that dynamically adjusts unimodal features for fusion to achieve better generalized FAS. Finally, our CCPE has been validated for its effectiveness in multiple cross-domain experiments and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.

  The advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have led to a growing interest in autonomous driving to leverage their strong reasoning capabilities. However, extending these capabilities from 2D to full 3D understanding is crucial for real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose OmniDrive, a holistic vision-language dataset that aligns agent models with 3D driving tasks through counterfactual reasoning. This approach enhances decision-making by evaluating potential scenarios and their outcomes, similar to human drivers considering alternative actions. Our counterfactual-based synthetic data annotation process generates large-scale, high-quality datasets, providing denser supervision signals that bridge planning trajectories and language-based reasoning. Futher, we explore two advanced OmniDrive-Agent frameworks, namely Omni-L and Omni-Q, to assess the importance of vision-language alignment versus 3D perception, revealing critical insights into designing effective LLM-agents. Significant improvements on the DriveLM Q\&A benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and methods.

  Medical image analysis is a fundamental component. As deep learning progresses, the focus has shifted from single-task applications, such as classification and segmentation, to more complex multimodal tasks, including medical visual question answering and report generation. Traditional shallow and task-specific models are increasingly limited in addressing the complexity and scalability required in clinical practice. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has driven the development of medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), offering a unified solution for diverse vision-language tasks. In this study, we investigate various architectural designs for medical LVLMs based on the widely adopted LLaVA framework, which follows an encoder-connector-LLM paradigm. We construct two distinct models targeting 2D and 3D modalities, respectively. These models are designed to support both general-purpose medical tasks and domain-specific fine-tuning, thereby serving as effective foundation models. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we develop a modular and extensible codebase, MedM-VL, and release two LVLM variants: MedM-VL-2D for 2D medical image analysis and MedM-VL-CT-Chest for 3D CT-based applications.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have remarkably progressed in analyzing and understanding images. Despite these advancements, accurately regressing values in charts remains an underexplored area for MLLMs. For visualization, how do MLLMs perform when applied to graphical perception tasks? Our paper investigates this question by reproducing Cleveland and McGill's seminal 1984 experiment and comparing it against human task performance. Our study primarily evaluates fine-tuned and pretrained models and zero-shot prompting to determine if they closely match human graphical perception. Our findings highlight that MLLMs outperform human task performance in some cases but not in others. We highlight the results of all experiments to foster an understanding of where MLLMs succeed and fail when applied to data visualization.

  To effectively reduce the visual tokens in Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs), we propose a novel approach called Window Token Concatenation (WiCo). Specifically, we employ a sliding window to concatenate spatially adjacent visual tokens. However, directly concatenating these tokens may group diverse tokens into one, and thus obscure some fine details. To address this challenge, we propose fine-tuning the last few layers of the vision encoder to adaptively adjust the visual tokens, encouraging that those within the same window exhibit similar features. To further enhance the performance on fine-grained visual understanding tasks, we introduce WiCo+, which decomposes the visual tokens in later layers of the LLM. Such a design enjoys the merits of the large perception field of the LLM for fine-grained visual understanding while keeping a small number of visual tokens for efficient inference. We perform extensive experiments on both coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding tasks based on LLaVA-1.5 and Shikra, showing better performance compared with existing token reduction projectors.

  Efficiently understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge in computer vision. In this work, we revisit temporal search paradigms for long-form video understanding and address a fundamental issue pertaining to all state-of-the-art (SOTA) long-context vision-language models (VLMs). Our contributions are twofold: First, we frame temporal search as a Long Video Haystack problem: finding a minimal set of relevant frames (e.g., one to five) from tens of thousands based on specific queries. Upon this formulation, we introduce LV-Haystack, the first dataset with 480 hours of videos, 15,092 human-annotated instances for both training and evaluation aiming to improve temporal search quality and efficiency. Results on LV-Haystack highlight a significant research gap in temporal search capabilities, with current SOTA search methods only achieving 2.1% temporal F1 score on the Longvideobench subset. Next, inspired by visual search in images, we propose a lightweight temporal search framework, T* that reframes costly temporal search as spatial search. T* leverages powerful visual localization techniques commonly used in images and introduces an adaptive zooming-in mechanism that operates across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments show that integrating T* with existing methods significantly improves SOTA long-form video understanding. Under an inference budget of 32 frames, T* improves GPT-4o's performance from 50.5% to 53.1% and LLaVA-OneVision-OV-72B's performance from 56.5% to 62.4% on the Longvideobench XL subset.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating visual information, yet they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, especially when processing noisy or corrupted images. Although existing VLMs adopt security measures during training to mitigate such attacks, vulnerabilities associated with noise-augmented visual inputs are overlooked. In this work, we identify that missing noise-augmented training causes critical security gaps: many VLMs are susceptible to even simple perturbations such as Gaussian noise. To address this challenge, we propose Robust-VLGuard, a multimodal safety dataset with aligned / misaligned image-text pairs, combined with noise-augmented fine-tuning that reduces attack success rates while preserving functionality of VLM. For stronger optimization-based visual perturbation attacks, we propose DiffPure-VLM, leveraging diffusion models to convert adversarial perturbations into Gaussian-like noise, which can be defended by VLMs with noise-augmented safety fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the distribution-shifting property of diffusion model aligns well with our fine-tuned VLMs, significantly mitigating adversarial perturbations across varying intensities.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in either temporal or spatial localization. However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released.

  Deep learning models for autonomous driving, encompassing perception, planning, and control, depend on vast datasets to achieve their high performance. However, their generalization often suffers due to domain-specific data distributions, making an effective scene-based categorization of samples necessary to improve their reliability across diverse domains. Manual captioning, though valuable, is both labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating a bottleneck in the data annotation process. Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) present a compelling solution by automating image analysis and categorization through contextual queries, often without requiring retraining for new categories. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of LVLMs, including GPT-4 and LLaVA, to understand and classify urban traffic scenes on both an in-house dataset and the BDD100K. We propose a scalable captioning pipeline that integrates state-of-the-art models, enabling a flexible deployment on new datasets. Our analysis, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative insights, demonstrates the effectiveness of LVLMs to understand urban traffic scenarios and highlights their potential as an efficient tool for data-driven advancements in autonomous driving.

  Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which leverages image-level labels, has garnered significant attention due to its cost-effectiveness. The previous methods mainly strengthen the inter-class differences to avoid class semantic ambiguity which may lead to erroneous activation. However, they overlook the positive function of some shared information between similar classes. Categories within the same cluster share some similar features. Allowing the model to recognize these features can further relieve the semantic ambiguity between these classes. To effectively identify and utilize this shared information, in this paper, we introduce a novel WSSS framework called Prompt Categories Clustering (PCC). Specifically, we explore the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters through prompts. These clusters effectively represent the intrinsic relationships between categories. By integrating this relational information into the training network, our model is able to better learn the hidden connections between categories. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing its ability to enhance performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and surpass existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.

  Apparel is essential to human life, offering protection, mirroring cultural identities, and showcasing personal style. Yet, the creation of garments remains a time-consuming process, largely due to the manual work involved in designing them. To simplify this process, we introduce AIpparel, a multimodal foundation model for generating and editing sewing patterns. Our model fine-tunes state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) on a custom-curated large-scale dataset of over 120,000 unique garments, each with multimodal annotations including text, images, and sewing patterns. Additionally, we propose a novel tokenization scheme that concisely encodes these complex sewing patterns so that LLMs can learn to predict them efficiently. AIpparel achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-modal tasks, including text-to-garment and image-to-garment prediction, and enables novel multimodal garment generation applications such as interactive garment editing.

  Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have emerged as an extension of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling the integration of various modalities. However, Any-to-Any MLLMs are limited to generating pairwise modalities 'Text + X' within a single response, such as Text + {Image or Audio or Video}. To address this limitation, we introduce Spider, a novel efficient Any-to-Many Modalities Generation (AMMG) framework, which can generate an arbitrary combination of modalities 'Text + Xs', such as Text + {Image and Audio and Video}. To achieve efficient AMMG, our Spider integrates three core components: a Base Model for basic X-to-X (i.e., Any-to-Any) modality processing, an Any-to-Many Instruction Template designed for producing Xs signal prompts, and a novel Efficient Decoders-Controller for controlling multimodal Decoders to generate Xs (many-modal) contents. To train Spider, we constructed a novel Text-formatted Many-Modal (TMM) dataset, which facilitates learning the X-to-Xs (i.e., Any-to-Many) capability necessary for AMMG. Ultimately, the well-trained Spider generates a pseudo X-to-Xs dataset, the first-ever X-to-Xs many-modal dataset, enhancing the potential for AMMG tasks in future research. Overall, this work not only pushes the boundary of multimodal interaction but also provides rich data support for advancing the field. Code:this https URL

  Several medical Multimodal Large Languange Models (MLLMs) have been developed to address tasks involving visual images with textual instructions across various medical modalities, achieving impressive results. Most current medical generalist models are region-agnostic, treating the entire image as a holistic representation. However, they struggle to identify which specific regions they are focusing on when generating a sentence. To mimic the behavior of doctors, who typically begin by reviewing the entire image before concentrating on specific regions for a thorough evaluation, we aim to enhance the capability of medical MLLMs in understanding anatomical regions within entire medical scans. To achieve it, we first formulate Region-Centric tasks and construct a large-scale dataset, MedRegInstruct, to incorporate regional information into training. Combining our collected dataset with other medical multimodal corpora for training, we propose a Region-Aware medical MLLM, MedRegA, which is the first bilingual generalist medical AI system to simultaneously handle image-level and region-level medical vision-language tasks across a broad range of modalities. Our MedRegA not only enables three region-centric tasks, but also achieves the best performance for visual question answering, report generation and medical image classification over 8 modalities, showcasing significant versatility. Experiments demonstrate that our model can not only accomplish powerful performance across various medical vision-language tasks in bilingual settings, but also recognize and detect structures in multimodal medical scans, boosting the interpretability and user interactivity of medical MLLMs. Our project page isthis https URL.

  Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated satisfactory performance across various vision-language tasks. Current approaches for vision and language interaction fall into two categories: self-attention-based and cross-attention-based methods. However, both approaches present inherent limitations, forcing a trade-off between data and computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce the Data-$\textbf{E}$fficient and Compute-$\textbf{E}$fficient $\textbf{MLLM}$ ($\textbf{EE-MLLM}$). Specifically, we modify the original self-attention mechanism in MLLM to a composite attention mechanism. This mechanism has two key characteristics: 1) eliminating the computational overhead of self-attention among visual tokens to achieve $\textbf{compute efficiency}$, and 2) reusing the weights from each layer of LLM to facilitate effective vision-language modality alignment for $\textbf{data efficiency}$. As a result, EE-MLLM significantly outperforms Flamingo with limited training data, and reduces the prefilling time to 79 ms on an H800 GPU, compared to LLaVA's 277 ms. To further investigate the efficiency of EE-MLLM, we present a training-free variant named EE-MLLM-F, which reduces the computation cost of self-attention-based method without additional training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EE-MLLM across a range of benchmarks, including general-purpose datasets like MMBench and SeedBench, as well as fine-grained tasks such as TextVQA and DocVQA.

  Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality images given a text prompt. However, ensuring the prompt-image alignment remains a considerable challenge, i.e., generating images that faithfully align with the prompt's semantics. Recent works attempt to improve the faithfulness by optimizing the latent code, which potentially could cause the latent code to go out-of-distribution and thus produce unrealistic images. In this paper, we propose FRAP, a simple, yet effective approach based on adaptively adjusting the per-token prompt weights to improve prompt-image alignment and authenticity of the generated images. We design an online algorithm to adaptively update each token's weight coefficient, which is achieved by minimizing a unified objective function that encourages object presence and the binding of object-modifier pairs. Through extensive evaluations, we show FRAP generates images with significantly higher prompt-image alignment to prompts from complex datasets, while having a lower average latency compared to recent latent code optimization methods, e.g., 4 seconds faster than D&B on the COCO-Subject dataset. Furthermore, through visual comparisons and evaluation of the CLIP-IQA-Real metric, we show that FRAP not only improves prompt-image alignment but also generates more authentic images with realistic appearances. We also explore combining FRAP with prompt rewriting LLM to recover their degraded prompt-image alignment, where we observe improvements in both prompt-image alignment and image quality. We release the code at the following link:this https URL.

  Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that is difficult to detect early due to subjective symptom assessments. Recent advancements in large language models have offered efficient and cost-effective approaches for this objective. In this study, we evaluated the performance of four LLMs in depression detection using clinical interview data. We selected the best performing model and further tested it in the severity evaluation scenario and knowledge enhanced scenario. The robustness was evaluated in complex diagnostic scenarios using a dataset comprising 51074 statements from six different mental disorders. We found that DeepSeek V3 is the most reliable and cost-effective model for depression detection, performing well in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, with zero-shot being the most efficient choice. The evaluation of severity showed low agreement with the human evaluator, particularly for mild depression. The model maintains stably high AUCs for detecting depression in complex diagnostic scenarios. These findings highlight DeepSeek V3s strong potential for text-based depression detection in real-world clinical applications. However, they also underscore the need for further refinement in severity assessment and the mitigation of potential biases to enhance clinical reliability.

  Language is typically modelled with discrete sequences. However, the most successful approaches to language modelling, namely neural networks, are continuous and smooth function approximators. In this work, we show that Transformer-based language models implicitly learn to represent sentences as continuous-time functions defined over a continuous input space. This phenomenon occurs in most state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including Llama2, Llama3, Phi3, Gemma, Gemma2, and Mistral, and suggests that LLMs reason about language in ways that fundamentally differ from humans. Our work formally extends Transformers to capture the nuances of time and space continuity in both input and output space. Our results challenge the traditional interpretation of how LLMs understand language, with several linguistic and engineering implications.

  Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning demonstrate impressive problem-solving abilities. However, in this work, we identify a recurring issue where these models occasionally generate overly short reasoning, leading to degraded performance on even simple mathematical problems. Specifically, we investigate how reasoning length is embedded in the hidden representations of reasoning models and its impact on accuracy. Our analysis reveals that reasoning length is governed by a linear direction in the representation space, allowing us to induce overly short reasoning by steering the model along this direction. Building on this insight, we introduce ThinkEdit, a simple yet effective weight-editing approach to mitigate the issue of overly short reasoning. We first identify a small subset of attention heads (approximately 2%) that predominantly drive short reasoning behavior. We then edit the output projection weights of these heads to suppress the short reasoning direction. With changes to only 0.1% of the model's parameters, ThinkEdit effectively reduces overly short reasoning and yields notable accuracy gains for short reasoning outputs (+5.44%), along with an overall improvement across multiple math benchmarks (+2.43%). Our findings provide new mechanistic insights into how reasoning length is controlled within LLMs and highlight the potential of fine-grained model interventions to improve reasoning quality.

  Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences. While state-of-the-art applications like ChatGPT/GPT-4 commonly employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the inclusion of a critic network introduces significant computational overhead. REINFORCE-based methods, such as REINFORCE Leave One-Out (RLOO), ReMax, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), address this limitation by eliminating the critic network. However, these approaches face challenges in accurate advantage estimation. Specifically, they estimate advantages independently for responses to each prompt, which can lead to overfitting on simpler prompts and vulnerability to reward hacking. To address these challenges, we introduce REINFORCE++, a novel approach that removes the critic model while using the normalized reward of a batch as the baseline. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that REINFORCE++ exhibits robust performance across various reward models without requiring prompt set truncation. Furthermore, it achieves superior generalization in both RLHF and long chain-of-thought (CoT) settings compared to existing REINFORCE-based methods. The implementation is available atthis https URL.

  Handling long-context inputs is crucial for large language models (LLMs) in tasks such as extended conversations, document summarization, and many-shot in-context learning. While recent approaches have extended the context windows of LLMs and employed perplexity (PPL) as a standard evaluation metric, PPL has proven unreliable for assessing long-context capabilities. The underlying cause of this limitation has remained unclear. In this work, we provide a comprehensive explanation for this issue. We find that PPL overlooks key tokens, which are essential for long-context understanding, by averaging across all tokens and thereby obscuring the true performance of models in long-context scenarios. To address this, we propose \textbf{LongPPL}, a novel metric that focuses on key tokens by employing a long-short context contrastive method to identify them. Our experiments demonstrate that LongPPL strongly correlates with performance on various long-context benchmarks (e.g., Pearson correlation of -0.96), significantly outperforming traditional PPL in predictive accuracy. Additionally, we introduce \textbf{LongCE} (Long-context Cross-Entropy) loss, a re-weighting strategy for fine-tuning that prioritizes key tokens, leading to consistent improvements across diverse benchmarks. In summary, these contributions offer deeper insights into the limitations of PPL and present effective solutions for accurately evaluating and enhancing the long-context capabilities of LLMs. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  By pretraining on trillions of tokens, an LLM gains the capability of text generation. However, to enhance its utility and reduce potential harm, SFT and alignment are applied sequentially to the pretrained model. Due to the differing nature and objective functions of SFT and alignment, catastrophic forgetting has become a significant issue. To address this, we introduce Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), which integrates SFT and alignment into a single training stage using the same objective and loss functions through an implicit reward function. Our experimental results demonstrate that UFT outperforms SFT on instruction-tuning data alone. Moreover, when combining instruction-tuning data with alignment data, UFT effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting across these two stages and shows a clear advantage over sequentially applying SFT and alignment. This is evident in the significant improvements observed in the \textbf{ifeval} task for instruction-following and the \textbf{truthful-qa} task for factuality. The proposed general fine-tuning framework UFT establishes an effective and efficient pretraining-UFT paradigm for LLM training.

  Existing open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generally follow a training process involving pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. However, these models suffer from distribution shifts, which limit their multimodal reasoning, particularly in the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) performance. To address this, we introduce a preference optimization (PO) process to enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Specifically, (1) on the data side, we design an automated preference data construction pipeline to create MMPR, a high-quality, large-scale multimodal reasoning preference dataset; and (2) on the model side, we explore integrating PO with MLLMs, developing a simple yet effective method, termed Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO), which boosts multimodal CoT performance. Our approach enhances the multimodal reasoning abilities of both InternVL2-8B and InternVL2-76B. Notably, our model, InternVL2-8B-MPO, achieves an accuracy of 67.0 on MathVista, outperforming InternVL2-8B by 8.7 points and achieving performance comparable to the 10$\times$ larger InternVL2-76B. We hope this study could inspire further advancements in MLLMs. Code, data, and model are released.

  Text summarization is crucial for mitigating information overload across domains like journalism, medicine, and business. This research evaluates summarization performance across 17 large language models (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, open-source) using a novel multi-dimensional framework. We assessed models on seven diverse datasets (BigPatent, BillSum, CNN/DailyMail, PubMed, SAMSum, WikiHow, XSum) at three output lengths (50, 100, 150 tokens) using metrics for factual consistency, semantic similarity, lexical overlap, and human-like quality, while also considering efficiency factors. Our findings reveal significant performance differences, with specific models excelling in factual accuracy (deepseek-v3), human-like quality (claude-3-5-sonnet), and processing efficiency/cost-effectiveness (gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-2.0-flash). Performance varies dramatically by dataset, with models struggling on technical domains but performing well on conversational content. We identified a critical tension between factual consistency (best at 50 tokens) and perceived quality (best at 150 tokens). Our analysis provides evidence-based recommendations for different use cases, from high-stakes applications requiring factual accuracy to resource-constrained environments needing efficient processing. This comprehensive approach enhances evaluation methodology by integrating quality metrics with operational considerations, incorporating trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness to guide model selection for specific applications.

  Prompt Recovery, reconstructing prompts from the outputs of large language models (LLMs), has grown in importance as LLMs become ubiquitous. Most users access LLMs through APIs without internal model weights, relying only on outputs and logits, which complicates recovery. This paper explores a unique prompt recovery task focused on reconstructing prompts for style transfer and rephrasing, rather than typical question-answering. We introduce a dataset created with LLM assistance, ensuring quality through multiple techniques, and test methods like zero-shot, few-shot, jailbreak, chain-of-thought, fine-tuning, and a novel canonical-prompt fallback for poor-performing cases. Our results show that one-shot and fine-tuning yield the best outcomes but highlight flaws in traditional sentence similarity metrics for evaluating prompt recovery. Contributions include (1) a benchmark dataset, (2) comprehensive experiments on prompt recovery strategies, and (3) identification of limitations in current evaluation metrics, all of which advance general prompt recovery research, where the structure of the input prompt is unrestricted.

  Eliciting information to reduce uncertainty about a latent entity is a critical task in many application domains, e.g., assessing individual student learning outcomes, diagnosing underlying diseases, or learning user preferences. Though natural language is a powerful medium for this purpose, large language models (LLMs) and existing fine-tuning algorithms lack mechanisms for strategically gathering information to refine their own understanding of the latent entity. To harness the generalization power and world knowledge of LLMs in developing effective information-gathering strategies, we propose an adaptive elicitation framework that actively reduces uncertainty on the latent entity. Since probabilistic modeling of an abstract latent entity is difficult, our framework adopts a predictive view of uncertainty, using a meta-learned language model to simulate future observations and enable scalable uncertainty quantification over complex natural language. Through autoregressive forward simulation, our model quantifies how new questions reduce epistemic uncertainty, enabling the development of sophisticated information-gathering strategies to choose the most informative next queries. In experiments on the 20 questions game, dynamic opinion polling, and adaptive student assessment, our method consistently outperforms baselines in identifying critical unknowns and improving downstream predictions, illustrating the promise of strategic information gathering in natural language settings.

However, hallucinations "where models generate non-factual or misleading content" are especially problematic in smaller-scale architectures, limiting their real-worldthis http URLthis paper, we propose a unified Virtual Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion strategy that enhances inference performance and mitigates hallucinations in a single Qwen 1.5 0.5B model without increasing the parameter count. Our method leverages multiple domain-specific expert prompts (with the number of experts being adjustable) to guide the model from different perspectives. We apply a statistical outlier truncation strategy based on the mean and standard deviation to filter out abnormally high probability predictions, and we inject noise into the embedding space to promote output diversity. To clearly assess the contribution of each module, we adopt a fixed voting mechanism rather than a dynamic gating network, thereby avoiding additional confounding factors. We provide detailed theoretical derivations from both statistical and ensemble learning perspectives to demonstrate how our method reduces output variance and suppresses hallucinations. Extensive ablation experiments on dialogue generation tasks show that our approach significantly improves inference accuracy and robustness in small models. Additionally, we discuss methods for evaluating the orthogonality of virtual experts and outline the potential for future work involving dynamic expert weight allocation using gating networks.

  LLMs' remarkable ability to tackle a wide range of language tasks opened new opportunities for collaborative human-AI problem solving. LLMs can amplify human capabilities by applying their intuitions and reasoning strategies at scale. We explore whether human guides can be simulated, by generalizing from human demonstrations of guiding an AI system to solve complex language problems. We introduce CoLa, a novel self-guided learning paradigm for training automated $\textit{guides}$ and evaluate it on two QA datasets, a puzzle-solving task, and a constrained text generation task. Our empirical results show that CoLa consistently outperforms competitive approaches across all domains. Moreover, a small-sized trained guide outperforms a strong model like GPT-4 when acting as a guide. We compare the strategies employed by humans and automated guides by conducting a human study on a QA dataset. We show that automated guides outperform humans by adapting their strategies to reasoners' capabilities and conduct qualitative analyses highlighting distinct differences in guiding strategies.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted in post-training for large language models (LLMs) at scale. Recently, the incentivization of reasoning capabilities in LLMs from RL indicates that $\textit{proper learning methods could enable effective inference-time scalability}$. A key challenge of RL is to obtain accurate reward signals for LLMs in various domains beyond verifiable questions or artificial rules. In this work, we investigate how to improve reward modeling (RM) with more inference compute for general queries, i.e. the $\textbf{inference-time scalability of generalist RM}$, and further, how to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper learning methods. For the RM approach, we adopt pointwise generative reward modeling (GRM) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential for inference-time scaling. For the learning method, we propose Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) to foster scalable reward generation behaviors in GRMs through online RL, to generate principles adaptively and critiques accurately, resulting in $\textbf{DeepSeek-GRM}$ models. Furthermore, for effective inference-time scaling, we use parallel sampling to expand compute usage, and introduce a meta RM to guide voting process for better scaling performance. Empirically, we show that SPCT significantly improves the quality and scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models in various RM benchmarks without severe biases, and could achieve better performance compared to training-time scaling. DeepSeek-GRM still meets challenges in some tasks, which we believe can be addressed by future efforts in generalist reward systems. The models will be released and open-sourced.

  Cyberbullying (CB) presents a pressing threat, especially to children, underscoring the urgent need for robust detection systems to ensure online safety. However, progress in developing such systems is hindered by the scarcity of large, labeled datasets that are specifically tailored for specialized tasks and the target age groups. Creating these datasets relies heavily on human annotation, which not only strains resources but also raises significant ethical and legal concerns due to annotators' exposure to harmful content, notwithstanding the acquisition of this type of data from vulnerable populations such as children. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and labels. Our experiments demonstrate that synthetic data enables BERT-based CB classifiers to achieve performance close to that of those trained on fully authentic datasets (75.8% vs. 81.5% accuracy). Additionally, LLMs can effectively label authentic yet unlabeled data, allowing BERT classifiers to attain a comparable performance level (79.1% vs. 81.5% accuracy). These results highlight the potential of LLMs as a scalable, ethical, and cost-effective solution for generating data for CB detection.

  Understanding alignment techniques begins with comprehending zero-shot generalization brought by instruction tuning, but little of the mechanism has been understood. Existing work has largely been confined to the task level, without considering that tasks are artificially defined and, to LLMs, merely consist of tokens and representations. To bridge this gap, we investigate zero-shot generalization from the perspective of the data itself. We first demonstrate that zero-shot generalization happens very early during instruction tuning, with loss serving as a stable indicator. Next, we investigate training data arrangement through similarity and granularity perspectives, confirming that the timing of exposure to certain training examples may greatly facilitate generalization on unseen tasks. Finally, we propose a more grounded training data arrangement framework, Test-centric Multi-turn Arrangement, and show its effectiveness in promoting continual learning and further loss reduction. For the first time, we show that zero-shot generalization during instruction tuning is a form of similarity-based generalization between training and test data at the instance level.

  Large language models (LLMs) are foundational explorations to artificial general intelligence, yet their alignment with human values via instruction tuning and preference learning achieves only superficial compliance. Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.

  Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs), they can present unintended biases and harmful behaviors driven by encoded values, emphasizing the urgent need to understand the value mechanisms behind them. However, current research primarily evaluates these values through external responses with a focus on AI safety, lacking interpretability and failing to assess social values in real-world contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called ValueExploration, which aims to explore the behavior-driven mechanisms of National Social Values within LLMs at the neuron level. As a case study, we focus on Chinese Social Values and first construct C-voice, a large-scale bilingual benchmark for identifying and evaluating Chinese Social Values in LLMs. By leveraging C-voice, we then identify and locate the neurons responsible for encoding these values according to activation difference. Finally, by deactivating these neurons, we analyze shifts in model behavior, uncovering the internal mechanism by which values influence LLM decision-making. Extensive experiments on four representative LLMs validate the efficacy of our framework. The benchmark and code will be available.

  The use of language models for automatically evaluating long-form text (LLM-as-a-judge) is becoming increasingly common, yet most LLM judges are optimized exclusively for English, with strategies for enhancing their multilingual evaluation capabilities remaining largely unexplored in the current literature. This has created a disparity in the quality of automatic evaluation methods for non-English languages, ultimately hindering the development of models with better multilingual capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-Prometheus, a suite of open-weight LLM judges ranging from 3B to 14B parameters that can provide both direct assessment and pairwise comparison feedback on multilingual outputs. M-Prometheus models outperform state-of-the-art open LLM judges on multilingual reward benchmarks spanning more than 20 languages, as well as on literary machine translation (MT) evaluation covering 4 language pairs. Furthermore, M-Prometheus models can be leveraged at decoding time to significantly improve generated outputs across all 3 tested languages, showcasing their utility for the development of better multilingual models. Lastly, through extensive ablations, we identify the key factors for obtaining an effective multilingual judge, including backbone model selection and training on natively multilingual feedback data instead of translated data. We release our models, training dataset, and code.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized their ability to handle single-turn tasks, yet real-world applications demand sophisticated multi-turn interactions. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in evaluating and enhancing multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Focusing on task-specific scenarios, from instruction following in diverse domains such as math and coding to complex conversational engagements in roleplay, healthcare, education, and even adversarial jailbreak settings, we systematically examine the challenges of maintaining context, coherence, fairness, and responsiveness over prolonged dialogues. The paper organizes current benchmarks and datasets into coherent categories that reflect the evolving landscape of multi-turn dialogue evaluation. In addition, we review a range of enhancement methodologies under multi-turn settings, including model-centric strategies (contextual learning, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and new architectures), external integration approaches (memory-augmented, retrieval-based methods, and knowledge graph), and agent-based techniques for collaborative interactions. Finally, we discuss open challenges and propose future directions for research to further advance the robustness and effectiveness of multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Related resources and papers are available atthis https URL.

  Understanding how people of various demographics think, feel, and express themselves (collectively called group expression) is essential for social science and underlies the assessment of bias in Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs can effectively summarize group expression when provided with empirical examples, coming up with generalizable theories of how a group's expression manifests in real-world text is challenging. In this paper, we define a new task called Group Theorization, in which a system must write theories that differentiate expression across demographic groups. We make available a large dataset on this task, Splits!, constructed by splitting Reddit posts by neutral topics (e.g. sports, cooking, and movies) and by demographics (e.g. occupation, religion, and race). Finally, we suggest a simple evaluation framework for assessing how effectively a method can generate 'better' theories about group expression, backed by human validation. We publicly release the raw corpora and evaluation scripts for Splits! to help researchers assess how methods infer--and potentially misrepresent--group differences in expression. We make Splits! and our evaluation module available atthis https URL.

  Despite the recent success of large language models (LLMs), LLMs are particularly challenging in long-sequence inference scenarios due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism. Inspired by the interpretability theory of feature attribution in neural network models, we observe that not all tokens have the same contribution. Based on this observation, we propose a novel token pruning framework, namely Saliency-driven Dynamic Token Pruning (SDTP), to gradually and dynamically prune redundant tokens based on the input context. Specifically, a lightweight saliency-driven prediction module is designed to estimate the importance score of each token with its hidden state, which is added to different layers of the LLM to hierarchically prune redundant tokens. Furthermore, a ranking-based optimization strategy is proposed to minimize the ranking divergence of the saliency score and the predicted importance score. Extensive experiments have shown that our framework is generalizable to various models and datasets. By hierarchically pruning 65\% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 33\% $\sim$ 47\% FLOPs and achieves speedup up to 1.75$\times$ during inference, while maintaining comparable performance. We further demonstrate that SDTP can be combined with KV cache compression method for further compression.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced sentiment analysis, yet their inherent uncertainty and variability pose critical challenges to achieving reliable and consistent outcomes. This paper systematically explores the Model Variability Problem (MVP) in LLM-based sentiment analysis, characterized by inconsistent sentiment classification, polarization, and uncertainty arising from stochastic inference mechanisms, prompt sensitivity, and biases in training data. We analyze the core causes of MVP, presenting illustrative examples and a case study to highlight its impact. In addition, we investigate key challenges and mitigation strategies, paying particular attention to the role of temperature as a driver of output randomness and emphasizing the crucial role of explainability in improving transparency and user trust. By providing a structured perspective on stability, reproducibility, and trustworthiness, this study helps develop more reliable, explainable, and robust sentiment analysis models, facilitating their deployment in high-stakes domains such as finance, healthcare, and policymaking, among others.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this retrospective study, a dataset was constructed with two parts. The first part included 1,656 synthetic chest radiology reports generated by GPT-4 using specified prompts, with 828 being error-free synthetic reports and 828 containing errors. The second part included 614 reports: 307 error-free reports between 2011 and 2016 from the MIMIC-CXR database and 307 corresponding synthetic reports with errors generated by GPT-4 on the basis of these MIMIC-CXR reports and specified prompts. All errors were categorized into four types: negation, left/right, interval change, and transcription errors. Then, several models, including Llama-3, GPT-4, and BiomedBERT, were refined using zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, or fine-tuning strategies. Finally, the performance of these models was evaluated using the F1 score, 95\% confidence interval (CI) and paired-sample t-tests on our constructed dataset, with the prediction results further assessed by radiologists. Using zero-shot prompting, the fine-tuned Llama-3-70B-Instruct model achieved the best performance with the following F1 scores: 0.769 for negation errors, 0.772 for left/right errors, 0.750 for interval change errors, 0.828 for transcription errors, and 0.780 overall. In the real-world evaluation phase, two radiologists reviewed 200 randomly selected reports output by the model. Of these, 99 were confirmed to contain errors detected by the models by both radiologists, and 163 were confirmed to contain model-detected errors by at least one radiologist. Generative LLMs, fine-tuned on synthetic and MIMIC-CXR radiology reports, greatly enhanced error detection in radiology reports.

  Although LLM-based agents have attracted significant attention in domains such as software engineering and machine learning research, their role in advancing combinatorial optimization (CO) remains relatively underexplored. This gap underscores the need for a deeper understanding of their potential in tackling structured, constraint-intensive problems-a pursuit currently limited by the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for systematic investigation. To address this, we introduce CO-Bench, a benchmark suite featuring 36 real-world CO problems drawn from a broad range of domains and complexity levels. CO-Bench includes structured problem formulations and curated data to support rigorous investigation of LLM agents. We evaluate multiple agent frameworks against established human-designed algorithms, revealing key strengths and limitations of current approaches and identifying promising directions for future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates the emergence of Theory-of-Mind (ToM) capabilities in large language models (LLMs) from a mechanistic perspective, focusing on the role of extremely sparse parameter patterns. We introduce a novel method to identify ToM-sensitive parameters and reveal that perturbing as little as 0.001% of these parameters significantly degrades ToM performance while also impairing contextual localization and language understanding. To understand this effect, we analyze their interaction with core architectural components of LLMs. Our findings demonstrate that these sensitive parameters are closely linked to the positional encoding module, particularly in models using Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), where perturbations disrupt dominant-frequency activations critical for contextual processing. Furthermore, we show that perturbing ToM-sensitive parameters affects LLM's attention mechanism by modulating the angle between queries and keys under positional encoding. These insights provide a deeper understanding of how LLMs acquire social reasoning abilities, bridging AI interpretability with cognitive science. Our results have implications for enhancing model alignment, mitigating biases, and improving AI systems designed for human interaction.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Needle In A Haystack (NIAH) task has been widely used to evaluate the long-context question-answering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, its reliance on simple retrieval limits its effectiveness. To address this limitation, recent studies have introduced the Multiple Needles In A Haystack Reasoning (MNIAH-R) task, which incorporates supporting documents (Multiple needles) of multi-hop reasoning tasks into a distracting context (Haystack}). Despite this advancement, existing approaches still fail to address the issue of models providing direct answers from internal knowledge, and they do not explain or mitigate the decline in accuracy as context length increases. In this paper, we tackle the memory-based answering problem by filtering out direct-answer questions, and we reveal that performance degradation is primarily driven by the reduction in the length of the thinking process as the input length increases. Building on this insight, we decompose the thinking process into retrieval and reasoning stages and introduce a reflection mechanism for multi-round extension. We also train a model using the generated iterative thinking process, which helps mitigate the performance degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this retrieval-reflection capability in mathematical reasoning scenarios, improving GPT-4o's performance on AIME2024.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This tutorial on adaptation of LLMs is designed to address the growing demand for models that go beyond the static capabilities of generic LLMs by providing an overview of dynamic, domain-specific, and task-adaptive LLM adaptation techniques. While general LLMs have demonstrated strong generalization across a variety of tasks, they often struggle to perform well in specialized domains such as finance, healthcare, and code generation for underrepresented languages. Additionally, their static nature limits their ability to evolve with the changing world, and they are often extremely large in size, making them impractical and costly to deploy at scale. As a result, the adaptation of LLMs has drawn much attention since the birth of LLMs and is of core importance, both for industry, which focuses on serving its targeted users, and academia, which can greatly benefit from small but powerful LLMs. To address this gap, this tutorial aims to provide an overview of the LLM adaptation techniques. We start with an introduction to LLM adaptation, from both the data perspective and the model perspective. We then emphasize how the evaluation metrics and benchmarks are different from other techniques. After establishing the problems, we explore various adaptation techniques. We categorize adaptation techniques into two main families. The first is parametric knowledge adaptation, which focuses on updating the parametric knowledge within LLMs. Additionally, we will discuss real-time adaptation techniques, including model editing, which allows LLMs to be updated dynamically in production environments. The second kind of adaptation is semi-parametric knowledge adaptation, where the goal is to update LLM parameters to better leverage external knowledge or tools through techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based systems.

  As large language models continue to scale, their growing computational and storage demands pose significant challenges for real-world deployment. In this work, we investigate redundancy within Transformer-based models and propose an entropy-based pruning strategy to enhance efficiency while maintaining performance. Empirical analysis reveals that the entropy of hidden representations decreases in the early blocks but progressively increases across most subsequent blocks. This trend suggests that entropy serves as a more effective measure of information richness within computation blocks. Unlike cosine similarity, which primarily captures geometric relationships, entropy directly quantifies uncertainty and information content, making it a more reliable criterion for pruning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our entropy-based pruning approach surpasses cosine similarity-based methods in reducing model size while preserving accuracy, offering a promising direction for efficient model deployment.

  Medical tasks such as diagnosis and treatment planning require precise and complex reasoning, particularly in life-critical domains. Unlike mathematical reasoning, medical reasoning demands meticulous, verifiable thought processes to ensure reliability and accuracy. However, there is a notable lack of datasets that provide transparent, step-by-step reasoning to validate and enhance the medical reasoning ability of AI models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedReason, a large-scale high-quality medical reasoning dataset designed to enable faithful and explainable medical problem-solving in large language models (LLMs). We utilize a structured medical knowledge graph (KG) to convert clinical QA pairs into logical chains of reasoning, or ``thinking paths'', which trace connections from question elements to answers via relevant KG entities. Each path is validated for consistency with clinical logic and evidence-based medicine. Our pipeline generates detailed reasoning for various medical questions from 7 medical datasets, resulting in a dataset of 32,682 question-answer pairs, each with detailed, step-by-step explanations. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with our dataset consistently boosts medical problem-solving capabilities, achieving significant gains of up to 7.7% for DeepSeek-Ditill-8B. Our top-performing model, MedReason-8B, outperforms the Huatuo-o1-8B, a state-of-the-art medical reasoning model, by up to 4.2% on the clinical benchmark MedBullets. We also engage medical professionals from diverse specialties to assess our dataset's quality, ensuring MedReason offers accurate and coherent medical reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper reports the first brain-inspired large language model (BriLLM). This is a non-Transformer, non-GPT, non-traditional machine learning input-output controlled generative language model. The model is based on the Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) definition on the directed graph in terms of the neural network, and has the interpretability of all nodes on the graph of the whole model, instead of the traditional machine learning model that only has limited interpretability at the input and output ends. In the language model scenario, the token is defined as a node in the graph. A randomly shaped or user-defined signal flow flows between nodes on the principle of "least resistance" along paths. The next token or node to be predicted or generated is the target of the signal flow. As a language model, BriLLM theoretically supports infinitely long $n$-gram models when the model size is independent of the input and predicted length of the model. The model's working signal flow provides the possibility of recall activation and innate multi-modal support similar to the cognitive patterns of the human brain. At present, we released the first BriLLM version in Chinese, with 4000 tokens, 32-dimensional node width, 16-token long sequence prediction ability, and language model prediction performance comparable to GPT-1. More computing power will help us explore the infinite possibilities depicted above.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The linear growth of key-value (KV) cache memory and quadratic computational in attention mechanisms complexity pose significant bottlenecks for large language models (LLMs) in long-context processing. While existing KV cache optimization methods address these challenges through token pruning or feature merging, they often incur irreversible information loss or require costly parameter retraining. To this end, we propose ZSMerge, a dynamic KV cache compression framework designed for efficient cache management, featuring three key operations: (1) fine-grained memory allocation guided by multi-dimensional token importance metrics at head-level granularity, (2) a residual merging mechanism that preserves critical context through compensated attention scoring, and (3) a zero-shot adaptation mechanism compatible with diverse LLM architectures without requiring retraining. ZSMerge significantly enhances memory efficiency and inference speed with negligible performance degradation across LLMs. When applied to LLaMA2-7B, it demonstrates a 20:1 compression ratio for key-value cache retention (reducing memory footprint to 5\% of baseline) while sustaining comparable generation quality, coupled with triple throughput gains at extreme 54k-token contexts that eliminate out-of-memory failures.

  Event annotation is important for identifying market changes, monitoring breaking news, and understanding sociological trends. Although expert annotators set the gold standards, human coding is expensive and inefficient. Unlike information extraction experiments that focus on single contexts, we evaluate a holistic workflow that removes irrelevant documents, merges documents about the same event, and annotates the events. Although LLM-based automated annotations are better than traditional TF-IDF-based methods or Event Set Curation, they are still not reliable annotators compared to human experts. However, adding LLMs to assist experts for Event Set Curation can reduce the time and mental effort required for Variable Annotation. When using LLMs to extract event variables to assist expert annotators, they agree more with the extracted variables than fully automated LLMs for annotation.

  Language models are aligned to the collective voice of many, resulting in generic outputs that do not align with specific users' styles. In this work, we present Trial-Error-Explain In-Context Learning (TICL), a tuning-free method that personalizes language models for text generation tasks with fewer than 10 examples per user. TICL iteratively expands an in-context learning prompt via a trial-error-explain process, adding model-generated negative samples and explanations that provide fine-grained guidance towards a specific user's style. TICL achieves favorable win rates on pairwise comparisons with LLM-as-a-judge up to 91.5% against the previous state-of-the-art and outperforms competitive tuning-free baselines for personalized alignment tasks of writing emails, essays and news articles. Both lexical and qualitative analyses show that the negative samples and explanations enable language models to learn stylistic context more effectively and overcome the bias towards structural and formal phrases observed in their zero-shot outputs. By front-loading inference compute to create a user-specific in-context learning prompt that does not require extra generation steps at test time, TICL presents a novel yet simple approach for personalized alignment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination with non-factual or unfaithful statements, which undermines the applications in real-world scenarios. Recent researches focus on uncertainty-based hallucination detection, which utilizes the output probability of LLMs for uncertainty calculation and does not rely on external knowledge or frequent sampling from LLMs. Whereas, most approaches merely consider the uncertainty of each independent token, while the intricate semantic relations among tokens and sentences are not well studied, which limits the detection of hallucination that spans over multiple tokens and sentences in the passage. In this paper, we propose a method to enhance uncertainty modeling with semantic graph for hallucination detection. Specifically, we first construct a semantic graph that well captures the relations among entity tokens and sentences. Then, we incorporate the relations between two entities for uncertainty propagation to enhance sentence-level hallucination detection. Given that hallucination occurs due to the conflict between sentences, we further present a graph-based uncertainty calibration method that integrates the contradiction probability of the sentence with its neighbors in the semantic graph for uncertainty calculation. Extensive experiments on two datasets show the great advantages of our proposed approach. In particular, we obtain substantial improvements with 19.78% in passage-level hallucination detection.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced text-to-SQL systems. However, most LLM-based methods often narrowly focus on SQL generation, neglecting the complexities of real-world conversational queries. This oversight can lead to unreliable responses, particularly for ambiguous questions that cannot be directly addressed with SQL. To bridge this gap, we propose MMSQL, a comprehensive test suite designed to evaluate the question classification and SQL generation capabilities of LLMs by simulating real-world scenarios with diverse question types and multi-turn Q&A interactions. Using MMSQL, we assessed the performance of popular LLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, and identified key factors impacting their performance in such scenarios. Moreover, we introduce an LLM-based multi-agent framework that employs specialized agents to identify question types and determine appropriate answering strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the model's ability to navigate the complexities of conversational dynamics, effectively handling the diverse and complex nature of user queries.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) offer substantial promise for text classification in political science, yet their effectiveness often depends on high-quality prompts and exemplars. To address this, we introduce a three-stage framework that enhances LLM performance through automatic prompt optimization, dynamic exemplar selection, and a consensus mechanism. Our approach automates prompt refinement using task-specific exemplars, eliminating speculative trial-and-error adjustments and producing structured prompts aligned with human-defined criteria. In the second stage, we dynamically select the most relevant exemplars, ensuring contextually appropriate guidance for each query. Finally, our consensus mechanism mimics the role of multiple human coders for a single task, combining outputs from LLMs to achieve high reliability and consistency at a reduced cost. Evaluated across tasks including sentiment analysis, stance detection, and campaign ad tone classification, our method enhances classification accuracy without requiring task-specific model retraining or extensive manual adjustments to prompts. This framework not only boosts accuracy, interpretability and transparency but also provides a cost-effective, scalable solution tailored to political science applications. An open-source Python package (PoliPrompt) is available on GitHub.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in biochemical tasks, especially the molecule caption translation task, which aims to bridge the gap between molecules and natural language texts. However, previous methods in adapting LLMs to the molecule-caption translation task required extra domain-specific pre-training stages, suffered weak alignment between molecular and textual spaces, or imposed stringent demands on the scale of LLMs. To resolve the challenges, we propose In-Context Molecule Adaptation (ICMA), as a new paradigm allowing LLMs to learn the molecule-text alignment from context examples via In-Context Molecule Tuning. Specifically, ICMA incorporates the following three stages: Hybrid Context Retrieval, Post-retrieval Re-ranking, and In-context Molecule Tuning. Initially, Hybrid Context Retrieval utilizes BM25 Caption Retrieval and Molecule Graph Retrieval to retrieve similar informative context examples. Additionally, Post-retrieval Re-ranking is composed of Sequence Reversal and Random Walk selection to further improve the quality of retrieval results. Finally, In-Context Molecule Tuning unlocks the in-context learning and reasoning capability of LLMs with the retrieved examples and adapts the parameters of LLMs for better alignment between molecules and texts. Experimental results demonstrate that ICMA can empower LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art or comparable performance without extra training corpora and intricate structures, showing that LLMs are inherently in-context molecule learners.

  Emojis, which encapsulate semantics beyond mere words or phrases, have become prevalent in social network communications. This has spurred increasing scholarly interest in exploring their attributes and functionalities. However, emoji-related research and application face two primary challenges. First, researchers typically rely on crowd-sourcing to annotate emojis in order to understand their sentiments, usage intentions, and semantic meanings. Second, subjective interpretations by users can often lead to misunderstandings of emojis and cause the communication barrier. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various annotation tasks, with ChatGPT demonstrating expertise across multiple domains. In our study, we assess ChatGPT's effectiveness in handling previously annotated and downstream tasks. Our objective is to validate the hypothesis that ChatGPT can serve as a viable alternative to human annotators in emoji research and that its ability to explain emoji meanings can enhance clarity and transparency in online communications. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT has extensive knowledge of emojis. It is adept at elucidating the meaning of emojis across various application scenarios and demonstrates the potential to replace human annotators in a range of tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-thought explanations are widely used to inspect the decision process of large language models (LLMs) and to evaluate the trustworthiness of model outputs, making them important for effective collaboration between LLMs and humans. We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the alignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these explanations. This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides alignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response and the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering to safety standards), creating potential conflicts. The RM lacks a mechanism to assess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the generated explanation. Consequently, the LLM may engage in "reward hacking" by producing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation tailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning. To address this issue, we propose enriching the RM's input with a causal attribution of the prediction, allowing the RM to detect discrepancies between the generated self-explanation and the model's decision process. In controlled settings, we show that this approach reduces the tendency of the LLM to generate misleading explanations.

  Short answer assessment is a vital component of science education, allowing evaluation of students' complex three-dimensional understanding. Large language models (LLMs) that possess human-like ability in linguistic tasks are increasingly popular in assisting human graders to reduce their workload. However, LLMs' limitations in domain knowledge restrict their understanding in task-specific requirements and hinder their ability to achieve satisfactory performance. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) emerges as a promising solution by enabling LLMs to access relevant domain-specific knowledge during assessment. In this work, we propose an adaptive RAG framework for automated grading that dynamically retrieves and incorporates domain-specific knowledge based on the question and student answer context. Our approach combines semantic search and curated educational sources to retrieve valuable reference materials. Experimental results in a science education dataset demonstrate that our system achieves an improvement in grading accuracy compared to baseline LLM approaches. The findings suggest that RAG-enhanced grading systems can serve as reliable support with efficient performance gains.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite high benchmark scores, Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail simple problem, raising a critical question: Do LLMs learn mathematical principles or merely memorize patterns? Rather than designing increasingly complex benchmarks like recent works, we investigate this using elementary two-integer addition ($0$ to $2^{64}$), probing two core properties: commutativity ($A+B=B+A$) and compositional generalization (via isomorphic symbolic mappings, e.g., $7 \rightarrow y$). While state-of-the-art LLMs achieve 73.8-99.8\% accuracy on numerical addition, performance collapses to $\leq$7.5\% under symbolic mapping, indicating failure to generalize learned rules. Non-monotonic performance scaling with digit count and frequent commutativity violations (over 1,700 cases of $A+B \neq B+A$) further support this. Explicitly providing addition rules degrades performance by 81.2\% on average, while self-explanation maintains baseline accuracy, suggesting LLM arithmetic processing is misaligned with human-defined principles. Our findings indicate current LLMs rely on memory pattern over genuine rule learning, highlighting architectural limitations and the need for new approaches to achieve true mathematical reasoning.

  The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly large language models (LLMs), has brought significant advancements to the field of education. Among various applications, automatic short answer grading (ASAG), which focuses on evaluating open-ended textual responses, has seen remarkable progress with the introduction of LLMs. These models not only enhance grading performance compared to traditional ASAG approaches but also move beyond simple comparisons with predefined "golden" answers, enabling more sophisticated grading scenarios, such as rubric-based evaluation. However, existing LLM-powered methods still face challenges in achieving human-level grading performance in rubric-based assessments due to their reliance on fully automated approaches. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs in ASAG tasks by leveraging their interactive capabilities through a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach. Our proposed framework, GradeHITL, utilizes the generative properties of LLMs to pose questions to human experts, incorporating their insights to refine grading rubrics dynamically. This adaptive process significantly improves grading accuracy, outperforming existing methods and bringing ASAG closer to human-level evaluation.

  Real-world data, such as news articles, social media posts, and chatbot conversations, is inherently dynamic and non-stationary, presenting significant challenges for constructing real-time structured representations through knowledge graphs (KGs). Relation Extraction (RE), a fundamental component of KG creation, often struggles to adapt to evolving data when traditional models rely on static, outdated datasets. Continual Relation Extraction (CRE) methods tackle this issue by incrementally learning new relations while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This study investigates the application of pre-trained language models (PLMs), specifically large language models (LLMs), to CRE, with a focus on leveraging memory replay to address catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate decoder-only models (eg, Mistral-7B and Llama2-7B) and encoder-decoder models (eg, Flan-T5 Base) on the TACRED and FewRel datasets. Task-incremental fine-tuning of LLMs demonstrates superior performance over earlier approaches using encoder-only models like BERT on TACRED, excelling in seen-task accuracy and overall performance (measured by whole and average accuracy), particularly with the Mistral and Flan-T5 models. Results on FewRel are similarly promising, achieving second place in whole and average accuracy metrics. This work underscores critical factors in knowledge transfer, language model architecture, and KG completeness, advancing CRE with LLMs and memory replay for dynamic, real-time relation extraction.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite significant advancements in large language models (LLMs), a major drawback of reasoning models is their enormous token usage, which increases computational cost, resource requirements, and response time. In this work, we revisit the core principles of reinforcement learning (RL) and, through mathematical analysis, demonstrate that the tendency to generate lengthy responses arises inherently from RL-based optimization during training. This finding questions the prevailing assumption that longer responses inherently improve reasoning accuracy. Instead, we uncover a natural correlation between conciseness and accuracy that has been largely overlooked. Moreover, we show that introducing a secondary phase of RL post-training, using a small set of problems and limited resources, can significantly reduce a model's chain of thought while maintaining or even enhancing accuracy. Finally, we validate our conclusions through extensive experimental results.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Document-level context is crucial for handling discourse challenges in text-to-text document-level machine translation (MT). Despite the increased discourse challenges introduced by noise from automatic speech recognition (ASR), the integration of document-level context in speech translation (ST) remains insufficiently explored. In this paper, we develop DoCIA, an online framework that enhances ST performance by incorporating document-level context. DoCIA decomposes the ST pipeline into four stages. Document-level context is integrated into the ASR refinement, MT, and MT refinement stages through auxiliary LLM (large language model)-based modules. Furthermore, DoCIA leverages document-level information in a multi-level manner while minimizing computational overhead. Additionally, a simple yet effective determination mechanism is introduced to prevent hallucinations from excessive refinement, ensuring the reliability of the final results. Experimental results show that DoCIA significantly outperforms traditional ST baselines in both sentence and discourse metrics across four LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving ST performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tracking financial investments in climate adaptation is a complex and expertise-intensive task, particularly for Early Warning Systems (EWS), which lack standardized financial reporting across multilateral development banks (MDBs) and funds. To address this challenge, we introduce an LLM-based agentic AI system that integrates contextual retrieval, fine-tuning, and multi-step reasoning to extract relevant financial data, classify investments, and ensure compliance with funding guidelines. Our study focuses on a real-world application: tracking EWS investments in the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) Fund. We analyze 25 MDB project documents and evaluate multiple AI-driven classification methods, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, fine-tuned transformer-based classifiers, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and an agent-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach. Our results show that the agent-based RAG approach significantly outperforms other methods, achieving 87\% accuracy, 89\% precision, and 83\% recall. Additionally, we contribute a benchmark dataset and expert-annotated corpus, providing a valuable resource for future research in AI-driven financial tracking and climate finance transparency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been widely recognized for its ability to enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) through the generation of explicit explanatory rationales. However, our study reveals a surprising contradiction to this prevailing perspective. Through extensive experiments involving 16 state-of-the-art LLMs and nine diverse pattern-based in-context learning (ICL) datasets, we demonstrate that CoT and its reasoning variants consistently underperform direct answering across varying model scales and benchmark complexities. To systematically investigate this unexpected phenomenon, we designed extensive experiments to validate several hypothetical explanations. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental explicit-implicit duality driving CoT's performance in pattern-based ICL: while explicit reasoning falters due to LLMs' struggles to infer underlying patterns from demonstrations, implicit reasoning-disrupted by the increased contextual distance of CoT rationales-often compensates, delivering correct answers despite flawed rationales. This duality explains CoT's relative underperformance, as noise from weak explicit inference undermines the process, even as implicit mechanisms partially salvage outcomes. Notably, even long-CoT reasoning models, which excel in abstract and symbolic reasoning, fail to fully overcome these limitations despite higher computational costs. Our findings challenge existing assumptions regarding the universal efficacy of CoT, yielding novel insights into its limitations and guiding future research toward more nuanced and effective reasoning methodologies for LLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant abilities in retrieving medical knowledge, reasoning over it and answering medical questions comparably to physicians. However, these models are not interpretable, hallucinate, are difficult to maintain and require enormous compute resources for training and inference. In this paper, we report results from Gyan, an explainable language model based on an alternative architecture, on the PubmedQA data set. The Gyan LLM is a compositional language model and the model is decoupled from knowledge. Gyan is trustable, transparent, does not hallucinate and does not require significant training or compute resources. Gyan is easily transferable across domains. Gyan-4.3 achieves SOTA results on PubmedQA with 87.1% accuracy compared to 82% by MedPrompt based on GPT-4 and 81.8% by Med-PaLM 2 (Google and DeepMind). We will be reporting results for other medical data sets - MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU - Medicine in the future.

  Machine unlearning is concerned with the task of removing knowledge learned from particular data points from a trained model. In the context of large language models (LLMs), unlearning has recently received increased attention, particularly for removing knowledge about named entities from models for privacy purposes. While various approaches have been proposed to address the unlearning problem, most existing approaches treat all data points to be unlearned equally, i.e., unlearning that Montreal is a city in Canada is treated exactly the same as unlearning the phone number of the first author of this paper. In this work, we show that this all data is equal assumption does not hold for LLM unlearning. We study how the success of unlearning depends on the frequency of the knowledge we want to unlearn in the pre-training data of a model and find that frequency strongly affects unlearning, i.e., more frequent knowledge is harder to unlearn. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between probability and generation-based evaluations of unlearning and show that this problem worsens as models become larger. Overall, our experiments highlight the need for better evaluation practices and novel methods for LLM unlearning that take the training data of models into account.

  The study of large language models (LLMs) is a key area in open-world machine learning. Although LLMs demonstrate remarkable natural language processing capabilities, they also face several challenges, including consistency issues, hallucinations, and jailbreak vulnerabilities. Jailbreaking refers to the crafting of prompts that bypass alignment safeguards, leading to unsafe outputs that compromise the integrity of LLMs. This work specifically focuses on the challenge of jailbreak vulnerabilities and introduces a novel taxonomy of jailbreak attacks grounded in the training domains of LLMs. It characterizes alignment failures through generalization, objectives, and robustness gaps. Our primary contribution is a perspective on jailbreak, framed through the different linguistic domains that emerge during LLM training and alignment. This viewpoint highlights the limitations of existing approaches and enables us to classify jailbreak attacks on the basis of the underlying model deficiencies they exploit. Unlike conventional classifications that categorize attacks based on prompt construction methods (e.g., prompt templating), our approach provides a deeper understanding of LLM behavior. We introduce a taxonomy with four categories -- mismatched generalization, competing objectives, adversarial robustness, and mixed attacks -- offering insights into the fundamental nature of jailbreak vulnerabilities. Finally, we present key lessons derived from this taxonomic study.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is key to enhancing large language models (LLMs) to systematically access richer factual knowledge. Yet, using RAG brings intrinsic challenges, as LLMs must deal with potentially conflicting knowledge, especially in multilingual retrieval, where the heterogeneity of knowledge retrieved may deliver different outlooks. To make RAG more analytical, critical and grounded, we introduce Dialectic-RAG (DRAG), a modular approach guided by Argumentative Explanations, i.e., structured reasoning process that systematically evaluates retrievedinformation by comparing, contrasting, and resolving conflicting perspectives. Given a query and a set of multilingual related documents, DRAG selects and exemplifies relevant knowledge for delivering dialectic explanations that, by critically weighing opposing arguments and filtering extraneous content, clearly determine the final response. Through a series of in-depth experiments, we show the impact of our framework both as an in-context learning strategy and for constructing demonstrations to instruct smaller models. The final results demonstrate that DRAG significantly improves RAG approaches, requiring low-impact computational effort and providing robustness to knowledge perturbations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper evaluates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage contextual information in the form of structured linguistic representations. Specifically, we examine the impact of encoding both short and long contexts using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) structures across a diverse set of language tasks. We perform our analysis using 8-bit quantized and instruction-tuned versions of Llama 3.1 (8B), Phi-3, and Mistral 7B. Our results indicate that, for tasks involving short contexts, augmenting the prompt with the AMR of the original language context often degrades the performance of the underlying LLM. However, for tasks that involve long contexts, such as dialogue summarization in the SAMSum dataset, this enhancement improves LLM performance, for example, by increasing the zero-shot cosine similarity score of Llama 3.1 from 66.2% to 76%. This improvement is more evident in the newer and larger LLMs, but does not extend to the older or smaller ones. In addition, we observe that LLMs can effectively reconstruct the original text from a linearized AMR, achieving a cosine similarity of 81.3% in the best-case scenario.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the performance of conversational AI systems. To extend their capabilities to knowledge-intensive domains such as biomedical and legal fields, where the accuracy is critical, LLMs are often combined with information retrieval (IR) systems to generate responses based on retrieved documents. However, for IR systems to effectively support such applications, they must go beyond simple semantic matching and accurately capture diverse query intents, including causal relationships. Existing IR models primarily focus on retrieving documents based on surface-level semantic similarity, overlooking deeper relational structures such as causality. To address this, we propose CAWAI, a retrieval model that is trained with dual objectives: semantic and causal relations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CAWAI outperforms various models on diverse causal retrieval tasks especially under large-scale retrieval settings. We also show that CAWAI exhibits strong zero-shot generalization across scientific domain QA tasks.

  Cell type annotation is critical for understanding cellular heterogeneity. Based on single-cell RNA-seq data and deep learning models, good progress has been made in annotating a fixed number of cell types within a specific tissue. However, universal cell annotation, which can generalize across tissues, discover novel cell types, and extend to novel cell types, remains less explored. To fill this gap, this paper proposes scAgent, a universal cell annotation framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). scAgent can identify cell types and discover novel cell types in diverse tissues; furthermore, it is data efficient to learn novel cell types. Experimental studies in 160 cell types and 35 tissues demonstrate the superior performance of scAgent in general cell-type annotation, novel cell discovery, and extensibility to novel cell type.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the evolving landscape of conversational AI, generating concise, context-aware, and human-like dialogue using small and medium-sized language models (LLMs) remains a complex challenge. This study investigates the influence of LoRA rank, dataset scale, and prompt prefix design on both knowledge retention and stylistic alignment. While fine-tuning improves fluency and enables stylistic customization, its ability to integrate unseen knowledge is constrained -- particularly with smaller datasets. Conversely, RAG-augmented models, equipped to incorporate external documents at inference, demonstrated superior factual accuracy on out-of-distribution prompts, though they lacked the stylistic consistency achieved by fine-tuning. Evaluations by LLM-based judges across knowledge accuracy, conversational quality, and conciseness suggest that fine-tuning is best suited for tone adaptation, whereas RAG excels at real-time knowledge augmentation.

  Truly multilingual safety moderation efforts for Large Language Models (LLMs) have been hindered by a narrow focus on a small set of languages (e.g., English, Chinese) as well as a limited scope of safety definition, resulting in significant gaps in moderation capabilities. To bridge these gaps, we release POLYGUARD, a new state-of-the-art multilingual safety model for safeguarding LLM generations, and the corresponding training and evaluation datasets. POLYGUARD is trained on POLYGUARDMIX, the largest multilingual safety training corpus to date containing 1.91M samples across 17 languages (e.g., Chinese, Czech, English, Hindi). We also introduce POLYGUARDPROMPTS, a high quality multilingual benchmark with 29K samples for the evaluation of safety guardrails. Created by combining naturally occurring multilingual human-LLM interactions and human-verified machine translations of an English-only safety dataset (WildGuardMix; Han et al., 2024), our datasets contain prompt-output pairs with labels of prompt harmfulness, response harmfulness, and response refusal. Through extensive evaluations across multiple safety and toxicity benchmarks, we demonstrate that POLYGUARD outperforms existing state-of-the-art open-weight and commercial safety classifiers by 5.5%. Our contributions advance efforts toward safer multilingual LLMs for all global users.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce compression laws for language language models (LLMs). While recent scaling laws have sought to understand how LLMs scale with respect to model size, pre-training data, and computational resources, we focus on understanding how model compression affects the performance of a pre-trained LLM on downstream tasks. We empirically examine the effects of structured model compression on LLMs through over $1000$ experiments across eight models with sizes ranging from $0.5B$ to $14B$ parameters. Our findings indicate that the test cross-entropy loss increases quadratically with the compression ratio, whereas performance on downstream tasks declines only linearly. Our study emphasizes the importance of recovery fine-tuning in enhancing generation loss, showing that the test loss of compressed LLMs can improve by up to 55% with recovery fine-tuning. At higher compression ratios (up to 90%), compressed LLMs demonstrate a speed increase of 60% during inference compared to their uncompressed counterparts, compensating for the performance degradation at this level. However, for smaller models ($\le 7B$), the computational gains are limited, peaking at just 35%. We conclude that model compression can be highly beneficial for larger models, especially when a smaller model within the same computational budget is not available. These insights provide the practical guidelines for utilizing model compression techniques for adopting LLMs in real-life applications in resource-constrained settings.

  AI-generated content is becoming increasingly prevalent in the real world, leading to serious ethical and societal concerns. For instance, adversaries might exploit large multimodal models (LMMs) to create images that violate ethical or legal standards, while paper reviewers may misuse large language models (LLMs) to generate reviews without genuine intellectual effort. While prior work has explored detecting AI-generated images and texts, and occasionally tracing their source models, there is a lack of a systematic and fine-grained comparative study. Important dimensions--such as AI-generated images vs. text, fully vs. partially AI-generated images, and general vs. malicious use cases--remain underexplored. Furthermore, whether AI systems like GPT-4o can explain why certain forged content is attributed to specific generative models is still an open question, with no existing benchmark addressing this. To fill this gap, we introduce AI-FAKER, a comprehensive multimodal dataset with over 280,000 samples spanning multiple LLMs and LMMs, covering both general and malicious use cases for AI-generated images and texts. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (i) AI authorship detection depends not only on the generated output but also on the model's original training intent; and (ii) GPT-4o provides highly consistent but less specific explanations when analyzing content produced by OpenAI's own models, such as DALL-E and GPT-4o itself.

  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought about concerns regarding copyright infringement and unethical practices in data and model usage. For instance, slight modifications to existing LLMs may be used to falsely claim the development of new models, leading to issues of model copying and violations of ownership rights. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel metric for quantifying LLM similarity, which leverages perplexity curves and differences in Menger curvature. Comprehensive experiments validate the performance of our methodology, demonstrating its superiority over baseline methods and its ability to generalize across diverse models and domains. Furthermore, we highlight the capability of our approach in detecting model replication through simulations, emphasizing its potential to preserve the originality and integrity of LLMs. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) are advancing at an unprecedented pace globally, with regions increasingly adopting these models for applications in their primary language. Evaluation of these models in diverse linguistic environments, especially in low-resource languages, has become a major challenge for academia and industry. Existing evaluation frameworks are disproportionately focused on English and a handful of high-resource languages, thereby overlooking the realistic performance of LLMs in multilingual and lower-resource scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce GlotEval, a lightweight framework designed for massively multilingual evaluation. Supporting seven key tasks (machine translation, text classification, summarization, open-ended generation, reading comprehension, sequence labeling, and intrinsic evaluation), spanning over dozens to hundreds of languages, GlotEval highlights consistent multilingual benchmarking, language-specific prompt templates, and non-English-centric machine translation. This enables a precise diagnosis of model strengths and weaknesses in diverse linguistic contexts. A multilingual translation case study demonstrates GlotEval's applicability for multilingual and language-specific evaluations.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant disparities in performance across languages, primarily benefiting high-resource languages while marginalizing underrepresented ones. Continual Pretraining (CPT) has emerged as a promising approach to address this imbalance, although the relative effectiveness of monolingual, bilingual, and code-augmented data strategies remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates 36 CPT configurations involving three multilingual base models, across 30+ languages categorized as altruistic, selfish, and stagnant, spanning various resource levels. Our findings reveal three major insights: (1) Bilingual CPT improves multilingual classification but often causes language mixing issues during generation. (2) Including programming code data during CPT consistently enhances multilingual classification accuracy, particularly benefiting low-resource languages, but introduces a trade-off by slightly degrading generation quality. (3) Contrary to prior work, we observe substantial deviations from language classifications according to their impact on cross-lingual transfer: Languages classified as altruistic often negatively affect related languages, selfish languages show conditional and configuration-dependent behavior, and stagnant languages demonstrate surprising adaptability under certain CPT conditions. These nuanced interactions emphasize the complexity of multilingual representation learning, underscoring the importance of systematic studies on generalizable language classification to inform future multilingual CPT strategies.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in supporting decision-making applications, particularly as personal conversational assistants in the financial, healthcare, and legal domains. While prompt engineering strategies have enhanced the capabilities of LLMs in decision-making, cognitive biases inherent to LLMs present significant challenges. Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norms or rationality in decision-making that can lead to the production of inaccurate outputs. Existing cognitive bias mitigation strategies assume that input prompts contain (exactly) one type of cognitive bias and therefore fail to perform well in realistic settings where there maybe any number of biases.To fill this gap, we propose a cognitive debiasing approach, called self-debiasing, that enhances the reliability of LLMs by iteratively refining prompts. Our method follows three sequential steps -- bias determination, bias analysis, and cognitive debiasing -- to iteratively mitigate potential cognitive biases in prompts. Experimental results on finance, healthcare, and legal decision-making tasks, using both closed-source and open-source LLMs, demonstrate that the proposed self-debiasing method outperforms both advanced prompt engineering methods and existing cognitive debiasing techniques in average accuracy under no-bias, single-bias, and multi-bias settings.

  Objective: Zero-shot methodology promises to cut down on costs of dataset annotation and domain expertise needed to make use of NLP. Generative large language models trained to align with human goals have achieved high zero-shot performance across a wide variety of tasks. As of yet, it is unclear how well these models perform on biomedical relation extraction (RE). To address this knowledge gap, we explore patterns in the performance of OpenAI LLMs across a diverse sampling of RE tasks.Methods: We use OpenAI GPT-4-turbo and their reasoning model o1 to conduct end-to-end RE experiments on seven datasets. We use the JSON generation capabilities of GPT models to generate structured output in two ways: (1) by defining an explicit schema describing the structure of relations, and (2) using a setting that infers the structure from the prompt language.Results: Our work is the first to study and compare the performance of the GPT-4 and o1 for the end-to-end zero-shot biomedical RE task across a broad array of datasets. We found the zero-shot performances to be proximal to that of fine-tuned methods. The limitations of this approach are that it performs poorly on instances containing many relations and errs on the boundaries of textual mentions.Conclusion: Recent large language models exhibit promising zero-shot capabilities in complex biomedical RE tasks, offering competitive performance with reduced dataset curation and NLP modeling needs at the cost of increased computing, potentially increasing medical community accessibility. Addressing the limitations we identify could further boost reliability. The code, data, and prompts for all our experiments are publicly available:this https URL

  The rapid growth in the parameter size of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods to alleviate the computational costs of fine-tuning. Among these, Fisher Induced Sparse uncHanging (FISH) Mask is a selection-based PEFT technique that identifies a subset of pre-trained parameters for fine-tuning based on approximate Fisher information. However, the integration of FISH Mask with other PEFT methods, such as LoRA and Adapters, remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose FISH-Tuning, a novel approach that incorporates FISH Mask into addition-based and reparameterization-based PEFT methods, including LoRA, Adapters, and their variants. By leveraging Fisher information to select critical parameters within these methods, FISH-Tuning achieves superior performance without additional memory overhead or inference latency. Experimental results across various datasets and pre-trained models demonstrate that FISH-Tuning consistently outperforms the vanilla PEFT methods with the same proportion of trainable parameters.

  _Kepu Zhang, Weijie Yu, Zhongxiang Sun, Jun Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Syllogistic reasoning is a fundamental aspect of legal decision-making, enabling logical conclusions by connecting general legal principles with specific case facts. Although existing large language models (LLMs) can generate responses to legal questions, they fail to perform explicit syllogistic reasoning, often producing implicit and unstructured answers that lack explainability and trustworthiness. To address this limitation, we propose SyLeR, a novel framework that empowers LLMs to engage in explicit syllogistic legal reasoning. SyLeR integrates a tree-structured hierarchical retrieval mechanism to effectively combine relevant legal statutes and precedent cases, forming comprehensive major premises. This is followed by a two-stage fine-tuning process: supervised fine-tuning warm-up establishes a foundational understanding of syllogistic reasoning, while reinforcement learning with a structure-aware reward mechanism refines the ability of the model to generate diverse logically sound and well-structured reasoning paths. We conducted extensive experiments across various dimensions, including in-domain and cross-domain user groups (legal laypersons and practitioners), multiple languages (Chinese and French), and different LLM backbones (legal-specific and open-domain LLMs). The results show that SyLeR significantly improves response accuracy and consistently delivers explicit, explainable, and trustworthy legal reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated summarization of healthcare community question-answering forums is challenging due to diverse perspectives presented across multiple user responses to each question. The PerAnsSumm Shared Task was therefore proposed to tackle this challenge by identifying perspectives from different answers and then generating a comprehensive answer to the question. In this study, we address the PerAnsSumm Shared Task using two complementary paradigms: (i) a training-based approach through QLoRA fine-tuning of LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct, and (ii) agentic approaches including zero- and few-shot prompting with frontier LLMs (LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct and GPT-4o) and a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) framework that leverages a diverse set of LLMs by combining outputs from multi-layer feedback aggregation. For perspective span identification/classification, GPT-4o zero-shot achieves an overall score of 0.57, substantially outperforming the 0.40 score of the LLaMA baseline. With a 2-layer MoA configuration, we were able to improve LLaMA performance up by 28 percent to 0.51. For perspective-based summarization, GPT-4o zero-shot attains an overall score of 0.42 compared to 0.28 for the best LLaMA zero-shot, and our 2-layer MoA approach boosts LLaMA performance by 32 percent to 0.37. Furthermore, in few-shot setting, our results show that the sentence-transformer embedding-based exemplar selection provides more gain than manually selected exemplars on LLaMA models, although the few-shot prompting is not always helpful for GPT-4o. The YaleNLP team's approach ranked the overall second place in the shared task.

  _Abhilekh Borah, Hasnat Md Abdullah, Kangda Wei, Ruihong Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised questions about their ability to understand climate-related contexts. Though climate change dominates social media, analyzing its multimodal expressions is understudied, and current tools have failed to determine whether LLMs amplify credible solutions or spread unsubstantiated claims. To address this, we introduce CliME (Climate Change Multimodal Evaluation), a first-of-its-kind multimodal dataset, comprising 2579 Twitter and Reddit posts. The benchmark features a diverse collection of humorous memes and skeptical posts, capturing how these formats distill complex issues into viral narratives that shape public opinion and policy discussions. To systematically evaluate LLM performance, we present the Climate Alignment Quotient (CAQ), a novel metric comprising five distinct dimensions: Articulation, Evidence, Resonance, Transition, and Specificity. Additionally, we propose three analytical lenses: Actionability, Criticality, and Justice, to guide the assessment of LLM-generated climate discourse using CAQ. Our findings, based on the CAQ metric, indicate that while most evaluated LLMs perform relatively well in Criticality and Justice, they consistently underperform on the Actionability axis. Among the models evaluated, Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieves the highest overall performance. We publicly release our CliME dataset and code to foster further research in this domain.

  _Wei-Lin Chen, Zhepei Wei, Xinyu Zhu, Shi Feng, Yu Meng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automatic evaluators in applications such as benchmarking, reward modeling, and self-refinement. Prior work highlights a potential self-preference bias where LLMs favor their own generated responses, a tendency often intensifying with model size and capability. This raises a critical question: Is self-preference detrimental, or does it simply reflect objectively superior outputs from more capable models? Disentangling these has been challenging due to the usage of subjective tasks in previous studies. To address this, we investigate self-preference using verifiable benchmarks (mathematical reasoning, factual knowledge, code generation) that allow objective ground-truth assessment. This enables us to distinguish harmful self-preference (favoring objectively worse responses) from legitimate self-preference (favoring genuinely superior ones). We conduct large-scale experiments under controlled evaluation conditions across diverse model families (e.g., Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Mistral, Phi, GPT, DeepSeek). Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) Better generators are better judges -- LLM evaluators' accuracy strongly correlates with their task performance, and much of the self-preference in capable models is legitimate. (2) Harmful self-preference persists, particularly when evaluator models perform poorly as generators on specific task instances. Stronger models exhibit more pronounced harmful bias when they err, though such incorrect generations are less frequent. (3) Inference-time scaling strategies, such as generating a long Chain-of-Thought before evaluation, effectively reduce the harmful self-preference. These results provide a more nuanced understanding of LLM-based evaluation and practical insights for improving its reliability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has seen increasing adoption in healthcare, with specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging to support clinical applications. A fundamental requirement for these models is accurate identification of TCM drug ingredients. In this paper, we evaluate how general and TCM-specialized LLMs perform when identifying ingredients of Chinese drugs. Our systematic analysis reveals consistent failure patterns: models often interpret drug names literally, overuse common herbs regardless of relevance, and exhibit erratic behaviors when faced with unfamiliar formulations. LLMs also fail to understand the verification task. These findings demonstrate that current LLMs rely primarily on drug names rather than possessing systematic pharmacological knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach focused on ingredient names. Experiments across 220 TCM formulations show our method significantly improves accuracy from approximately 50% to 82% in ingredient verification tasks. Our work highlights critical weaknesses in current TCM-specific LLMs and offers a practical solution for enhancing their clinical reliability.

  With the rapid advancement of mathematical reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), AI systems are increasingly being adopted in educational settings to support students' comprehension of problem-solving processes. However, a critical component remains underexplored in current LLM-generated explanations: visual explanation. In real-world instructional contexts, human tutors routinely employ visual aids - such as diagrams, markings, and highlights - to enhance conceptual clarity. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of visual solution explanation, which requires generating explanations that incorporate newly introduced visual elements essential for understanding (e.g., auxiliary lines, annotations, or geometric constructions). To evaluate model performance on this task, we propose MathExplain, a multimodal benchmark consisting of 997 math problems annotated with visual keypoints and corresponding explanatory text that references those elements. Our empirical results show that while some closed-source models demonstrate promising capabilities on visual solution-explaining, current open-source general-purpose models perform inconsistently, particularly in identifying relevant visual components and producing coherent keypoint-based explanations. We expect that visual solution-explaining and the MathExplain dataset will catalyze further research on multimodal LLMs in education and advance their deployment as effective, explanation-oriented AI tutors. Code and data will be released publicly.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The vast amount of online information today poses challenges for non-English speakers, as much of it is concentrated in high-resource languages such as English and French. Wikipedia reflects this imbalance, with content in low-resource languages frequently outdated or incomplete. Recent research has sought to improve cross-language synchronization of Wikipedia tables using rule-based methods. These approaches can be effective, but they struggle with complexity and generalization. This paper explores large language models (LLMs) for multilingual information synchronization, using zero-shot prompting as a scalable solution. We introduce the Information Updation dataset, simulating the real-world process of updating outdated Wikipedia tables, and evaluate LLM performance. Our findings reveal that single-prompt approaches often produce suboptimal results, prompting us to introduce a task decomposition strategy that enhances coherence and accuracy. Our proposed method outperforms existing baselines, particularly in Information Updation (1.79%) and Information Addition (20.58%), highlighting the model strength in dynamically updating and enriching data across architectures.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While AI agents have shown remarkable performance at various tasks, they still struggle with complex multi-modal applications, structured generation and strategic planning. Improvements via standard fine-tuning is often impractical, as solving agentic tasks usually relies on black box API access without control over model parameters. Inference-time methods such as Best-of-N (BON) sampling offer a simple yet effective alternative to improve performance. However, BON lacks iterative feedback integration mechanism. Hence, we propose Iterative Agent Decoding (IAD) which combines iterative refinement with dynamic candidate evaluation and selection guided by a verifier. IAD differs in how feedback is designed and integrated, specifically optimized to extract maximal signal from reward scores. We conduct a detailed comparison of baselines across key metrics on Sketch2Code, Text2SQL, and Webshop where IAD consistently outperforms baselines, achieving 3--6% absolute gains on Sketch2Code and Text2SQL (with and without LLM judges) and 8--10% gains on Webshop across multiple metrics. To better understand the source of IAD's gains, we perform controlled experiments to disentangle the effect of adaptive feedback from stochastic sampling, and find that IAD's improvements are primarily driven by verifier-guided refinement, not merely sampling diversity. We also show that both IAD and BON exhibit inference-time scaling with increased compute when guided by an optimal verifier. Our analysis highlights the critical role of verifier quality in effective inference-time optimization and examines the impact of noisy and sparse rewards on scaling behavior. Together, these findings offer key insights into the trade-offs and principles of effective inference-time optimization.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that it is promising to utilize Process Reward Models (PRMs) as verifiers to enhance the performance of LLMs. However, current PRMs face three key challenges: (1) limited process supervision and generalization capabilities, (2) dependence on scalar value prediction without leveraging the generative abilities of LLMs, and (3) inability to scale the test-time compute of PRMs. In this work, we introduce GenPRM, a generative process reward model that performs explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with code verification before providing judgment for each reasoning step. To obtain high-quality process supervision labels and rationale data, we propose Relative Progress Estimation (RPE) and a rationale synthesis framework that incorporates code verification. Experimental results on ProcessBench and several mathematical reasoning tasks show that GenPRM significantly outperforms prior PRMs with only 23K training data from MATH dataset. Through test-time scaling, a 1.5B GenPRM outperforms GPT-4o, and a 7B GenPRM surpasses Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B on ProcessBench. Additionally, GenPRM demonstrates strong abilities to serve as a critic model for policy model refinement. This work establishes a new paradigm for process supervision that bridges the gap between PRMs and critic models in LLMs. Our code, model, and data will be available inthis https URL.

  Pre-training large language models (LLMs) necessitates enormous diverse textual corpora, making effective data selection a key challenge for balancing computational resources and model performance. Current methodologies primarily emphasize data quality metrics and mixing proportions, yet they fail to adequately capture the underlying semantic connections between training samples and quality disparities within individual domains. We introduce ToReMi (Topic-based Reweighting for Model improvement), a novel two-stage framework that dynamically adjusts training sample weights according to their topical associations and observed learning patterns. Our comprehensive experiments reveal that ToReMi variants consistently achieve superior performance over conventional pre-training approaches, demonstrating accelerated perplexity reduction across multiple domains and enhanced capabilities on downstream evaluation tasks.

  Recent math benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) such as MathArena indicate that state-of-the-art reasoning models achieve impressive performance on mathematical competitions like AIME, with the leading model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieving scores comparable to top human competitors. However, these benchmarks evaluate models solely based on final numerical answers, neglecting rigorous reasoning and proof generation which are essential for real-world mathematical tasks. To address this, we introduce the first comprehensive evaluation of full-solution reasoning for challenging mathematical problems. Using expert human annotators, we evaluated several state-of-the-art reasoning models on the six problems from the 2025 USAMO within hours of their release. Our results reveal that all tested models struggled significantly: only Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves a non-trivial score of 25%, while all other models achieve less than 5%. Through detailed analysis of reasoning traces, we identify the most common failure modes and find several unwanted artifacts arising from the optimization strategies employed during model training. Overall, our results suggest that current LLMs are inadequate for rigorous mathematical reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for substantial improvements in reasoning and proof generation capabilities.

  Recent research shows that LLMs can simulate ``believable'' human behaviors to power LLM agents via prompt-only methods. In this work, we focus on evaluating and improving LLM's objective ``accuracy'' rather than the subjective ``believability'' in the web action generation task, leveraging a large-scale, real-world dataset collected from online shopping human actions. We present the first comprehensive quantitative evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, Llama, and Claude) on the task of web action generation. Our results show that fine-tuning LLMs on real-world behavioral data substantially improves their ability to generate actions compared to prompt-only methods. Furthermore, incorporating synthesized reasoning traces into model training leads to additional performance gains, demonstrating the value of explicit rationale in behavior modeling. This work establishes a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in behavior simulation and offers actionable insights into how real-world action data and reasoning augmentation can enhance the fidelity of LLM agents.

  Clinical coding is a critical task in healthcare, although traditional methods for automating clinical coding may not provide sufficient explicit evidence for coders in production environments. This evidence is crucial, as medical coders have to make sure there exists at least one explicit passage in the input health record that justifies the attribution of a code. We therefore propose to reframe the task as an entity linking problem, in which each document is annotated with its set of codes and respective textual evidence, enabling better human-machine collaboration. By leveraging parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs), together with constrained decoding, we introduce three approaches to solve this problem that prove effective at disambiguating clinical mentions and that perform well in few-shot scenarios.

To facilitate further research in this area, we developed an evaluation framework, Evaluation of PHEnotyping for Observational Health Data (PHEONA), that outlines context-specific considerations. We applied and demonstrated PHEONA on concept classification, a specific task within a broader phenotyping process for Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) respiratory support therapies. From the sample concepts tested, we achieved high classification accuracy, suggesting the potential for LLM-based methods to improve computational phenotyping processes.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for assessing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), as it reveals confidence in predictions, identifies failure modes, and gauges output reliability. Conformal Prediction (CP), a model-agnostic method that generates prediction sets with a specified error rate, has been adopted for UQ in classification tasks, where the size of the prediction set indicates the model's uncertainty. However, when adapting CP to NLG, the sampling-based method for generating candidate outputs cannot guarantee the inclusion of the ground truth, limiting its applicability across a wide range of error rates. To address this, we propose \ourmethod, a method that explicitly adds the ground truth to the candidate outputs and uses logit scores to measure nonconformity. Our experiments with six LLMs on four NLG tasks show that \ourmethod outperforms baseline methods in calibrating error rates and empirical cover rates, offering accurate UQ across a wide range of user-specified error rates.

  LLM-as-a-Judge, which generates chain-of-thought (CoT) judgments, has become a widely adopted auto-evaluation method. However, its reliability is compromised by the CoT reasoning's inability to capture comprehensive and deeper details, often leading to incomplete outcomes. Existing methods mainly rely on majority voting or criteria expansion, which is insufficient to address the limitation in CoT. We propose Crowd-based Comparative Evaluation, which introduces additional crowd responses to compare with the candidate responses, thereby exposing deeper and more comprehensive details within the candidate responses. This process effectively guides LLM-as-a-Judge to provide a more detailed CoT judgment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances evaluation reliability, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.7% across five benchmarks. Moreover, our method produces higher-quality CoTs that facilitate judge distillation and exhibit superior performance in rejection sampling for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), referred to as crowd rejection sampling, thereby enabling more efficient SFT. Our analysis confirms that CoTs generated by ours are more comprehensive and of higher quality, and evaluation accuracy improves as inference scales.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) is closely tied to the design of prompts, making prompt optimization essential for enhancing their performance across a wide range of tasks. Many existing approaches to automating prompt engineering rely exclusively on textual feedback, refining prompts based solely on inference errors identified by large, computationally expensive LLMs. Unfortunately, smaller models struggle to generate high-quality feedback, resulting in complete dependence on large LLM judgment. Moreover, these methods fail to leverage more direct and finer-grained information, such as gradients, due to operating purely in text space. To this end, we introduce GReaTer, a novel prompt optimization technique that directly incorporates gradient information over task-specific reasoning. By utilizing task loss gradients, GReaTer enables self-optimization of prompts for open-source, lightweight language models without the need for costly closed-source LLMs. This allows high-performance prompt optimization without dependence on massive LLMs, closing the gap between smaller models and the sophisticated reasoning often needed for prompt refinement. Extensive evaluations across diverse reasoning tasks including BBH, GSM8k, and FOLIO demonstrate that GReaTer consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods, even those reliant on powerful LLMs. Additionally, GReaTer-optimized prompts frequently exhibit better transferability and, in some cases, boost task performance to levels comparable to or surpassing those achieved by larger language models, highlighting the effectiveness of prompt optimization guided by gradients over reasoning.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a reliable external knowledge augmentation technique to mitigate hallucination issues and parameterized knowledge limitations in Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing adaptive RAG (ARAG) systems excel at in-depth exploration within a single source but struggle to effectively and controllably explore different retrieval sources, as they fail to foresee their internal knowledge features. We develop a novel multi-source ARAG system, PrefRAG, which enhances RAG by enabling in-depth and controllable exploration of diverse retrieval sources through preference-driven adaptive retrieval and self-reflection. PrefRAG first fully explores controllable local sources in adaptive retrieval and supplements with the web when appropriate, ultimately selecting the optimal source for knowledge observation. Subsequently, PrefRAG feeds answer quality feedback into the retrieval process, optimizing it from the generation perspective to produce higher-quality responses. Extensive experiments confirm its superiority, high retrieval efficiency, and knowledge controllability. PrefRAG outperforms Vanilla RAG and the leading MS-ARAG by up to 25.6% and 13.9% respectively. Additionally, PrefRAG trained with DPO achieves higher performance. The code and data are available atthis https URL.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates factual errors and hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) for question-answering (QA) by incorporating external knowledge. However, existing adaptive RAG methods rely on LLMs to predict retrieval timing and directly use retrieved information for generation, often failing to reflect real information needs and fully leverage retrieved knowledge. We develop DeepNote, an adaptive RAG framework that achieves in-depth and robust exploration of knowledge sources through note-centric adaptive retrieval. DeepNote employs notes as carriers for refining and accumulating knowledge. During in-depth exploration, it uses these notes to determine retrieval timing, formulate retrieval queries, and iteratively assess knowledge growth, ultimately leveraging the best note for answer generation. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that DeepNote significantly outperforms all baselines (+10.2% to +20.1%) and exhibits the ability to gather knowledge with both high density and quality. Additionally, DPO further improves the performance of DeepNote. The code and data are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With significant efforts in recent studies, LLM-as-a-Judge has become a cost-effective alternative to human evaluation for assessing text generation quality in a wide range of tasks. However, there still remains a reliability gap between LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluation. One important reason is the lack of guided oracles in the evaluation process. Motivated by the role of reference pervasively used in classic text evaluation, we introduce RevisEval, a novel text generation evaluation paradigm via the response-adapted references. RevisEval is driven by the key observation that an ideal reference should maintain the necessary relevance to the response to be evaluated. Specifically, RevisEval leverages the text revision capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adaptively revise the response, then treat the revised text as the reference (response-adapted reference) for the subsequent evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevisEval outperforms traditional reference-free and reference-based evaluation paradigms that use LLM-as-a-Judge across NLG tasks and open-ended instruction-following tasks. More importantly, our response-adapted references can further boost the classical text metrics, e.g., BLEU and BERTScore, compared to traditional references and even rival the LLM-as-a-Judge. A detailed analysis is also conducted to confirm RevisEval's effectiveness in bias reduction, the impact of inference cost, and reference relevance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, aligning these models with human preferences has emerged as a critical challenge. Traditional alignment methods, relying on human or LLM annotated datasets, are limited by their resource-intensive nature, inherent subjectivity, misalignment with real-world user preferences, and the risk of feedback loops that amplify model biases. To overcome these limitations, we introduce WildFeedback, a novel framework that leverages in-situ user feedback during conversations with LLMs to create preference datasets automatically. Given a corpus of multi-turn user-LLM conversation, WildFeedback identifies and classifies user feedback to LLM responses between conversation turns. The user feedback is then used to create examples of preferred and dispreferred responses according to users' preference. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned on WildFeedback dataset exhibit significantly improved alignment with user preferences, as evidenced by both traditional benchmarks and our proposed checklist-guided evaluation. By incorporating in-situ feedback from actual users, WildFeedback addresses the scalability, subjectivity, and bias challenges that plague existing approaches, marking a significant step toward developing LLMs that are more responsive to the diverse and evolving needs of their users.

  In the field of large language models (LLMs), Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a critical technique for transferring capabilities from teacher models to student models. However, existing KD methods face limitations and challenges in distillation of LLMs, including efficiency and insufficient measurement capabilities of traditional KL divergence. It is shown that LLMs can serve as an implicit reward function, which we define as a supplement to KL divergence. In this work, we propose Direct Preference Knowledge Distillation (DPKD) for LLMs. DPKD utilizes distribution divergence to represent the preference loss and implicit reward function. We re-formulate KD of LLMs into two stages: first optimizing and objective consisting of implicit reward and reverse KL divergence and then improving the preference probability of teacher outputs over student outputs. We conducted experiments and analysis on various datasets with LLM parameters ranging from 120M to 13B and demonstrate the broad applicability and effectiveness of our DPKD approach. Meanwhile, we prove the value and effectiveness of the introduced implicit reward and output preference in KD through experiments and theoretical analysis. The DPKD method outperforms the baseline method in both output response precision and exact match percentage. Code and data are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Thanks to recent advances in generative AI, we are able to prompt large language models (LLMs) to produce texts which are fluent and grammatical. In addition, it has been shown that we can elicit attempts at grammatical error correction (GEC) from LLMs when prompted with ungrammatical input sentences. We evaluate how well LLMs can perform at GEC by measuring their performance on established benchmark datasets. We go beyond previous studies, which only examined GPT* models on a selection of English GEC datasets, by evaluating seven open-source and three commercial LLMs on four established GEC benchmarks. We investigate model performance and report results against individual error types. Our results indicate that LLMs do not always outperform supervised English GEC models except in specific contexts -- namely commercial LLMs on benchmarks annotated with fluency corrections as opposed to minimal edits. We find that several open-source models outperform commercial ones on minimal edit benchmarks, and that in some settings zero-shot prompting is just as competitive as few-shot prompting.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge graph completion (KGC) revolves around populating missing triples in a knowledge graph using available information. Text-based methods, which depend on textual descriptions of triples, often encounter difficulties when these descriptions lack sufficient information for accurate prediction-an issue inherent to the datasets and not easily resolved through modeling alone. To address this and ensure data consistency, we first use large language models (LLMs) to generate coherent descriptions, bridging the semantic gap between queries and answers. Secondly, we utilize inverse relations to create a symmetric graph, thereby providing augmented training samples for KGC. Additionally, we employ the label information inherent in knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance the existing contrastive framework, making it fully supervised. These efforts have led to significant performance improvements on the WN18RR and FB15k-237 datasets. According to standard evaluation metrics, our approach achieves a 4.2% improvement in Hit@1 on WN18RR and a 3.4% improvement in Hit@3 on FB15k-237, demonstrating superior performance.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on a variety of natural language tasks based on just a few examples of natural language instructions, reducing the need for extensive feature engineering. However, most powerful LLMs are closed-source or limited in their capability for languages other than English. In this technical report, we present Baichuan 2, a series of large-scale multilingual language models containing 7 billion and 13 billion parameters, trained from scratch, on 2.6 trillion tokens. Baichuan 2 matches or outperforms other open-source models of similar size on public benchmarks like MMLU, CMMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval. Furthermore, Baichuan 2 excels in vertical domains such as medicine and law. We will release all pre-training model checkpoints to benefit the research community in better understanding the training dynamics of Baichuan 2.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Assistive agents should be able to perform under-specified long-horizon tasks while respecting user preferences. We introduce Actively Discovering and Adapting to Preferences for any Task (ADAPT) -- a benchmark designed to evaluate agents' ability to adhere to user preferences across various household tasks through active questioning. Next, we propose Reflection-DPO, a novel training approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) to the task of active questioning. Reflection-DPO finetunes a 'student' LLM to follow the actions of a privileged 'teacher' LLM, and optionally ask a question to gather necessary information to better predict the teacher action. We find that prior approaches that use state-of-the-art LLMs fail to sufficiently follow user preferences in ADAPT due to insufficient questioning and poor adherence to elicited preferences. In contrast, Reflection-DPO achieves a higher rate of satisfying user preferences, outperforming a zero-shot chain-of-thought baseline by 6.1% on unseen users.

  Self-driving laboratories have begun to replace human experimenters in performing single experimental skills or predetermined experimental protocols. However, as the pace of idea iteration in scientific research has been intensified by Artificial Intelligence, the demand for rapid design of new protocols for new discoveries become evident. Efforts to automate protocol design have been initiated, but the capabilities of knowledge-based machine designers, such as Large Language Models, have not been fully elicited, probably for the absence of a systematic representation of experimental knowledge, as opposed to isolated, flatten pieces of information. To tackle this issue, we propose a multi-faceted, multi-scale representation, where instance actions, generalized operations, and product flow models are hierarchically encapsulated using Domain-Specific Languages. We further develop a data-driven algorithm based on non-parametric modeling that autonomously customizes these representations for specific domains. The proposed representation is equipped with various machine designers to manage protocol design tasks, including planning, modification, and adjustment. The results demonstrate that the proposed method could effectively complement Large Language Models in the protocol design process, serving as an auxiliary module in the realm of machine-assisted scientific exploration.

  In transportation system demand modeling and simulation, agent-based models and microsimulations are current state-of-the-art approaches. However, existing agent-based models still have some limitations on behavioral realism and resource demand that limit their applicability. In this study, leveraging the emerging technology of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents, we propose a general LLM-agent-based modeling framework for transportation systems. We argue that LLM agents not only possess the essential capabilities to function as agents but also offer promising solutions to overcome some limitations of existing agent-based models. Our conceptual framework design closely replicates the decision-making and interaction processes and traits of human travelers within transportation networks, and we demonstrate that the proposed systems can meet critical behavioral criteria for decision-making and learning behaviors using related studies and a demonstrative example of LLM agents' learning and adjustment in the bottleneck setting. Although further refinement of the LLM-agent-based modeling framework is necessary, we believe that this approach has the potential to improve transportation system modeling and simulation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as robotic planners but often struggle with long-horizon and complex tasks, especially in specialized environments requiring external knowledge. While hierarchical planning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) address some of these challenges, they remain insufficient on their own and a deeper integration is required for achieving more reliable systems. To this end, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach that enhances LLMs-based planners with Knowledge Graph-based RAG for hierarchical plan generation. This method decomposes complex tasks into manageable subtasks, further expanded into executable atomic action sequences. To ensure formal correctness and proper decomposition, we integrate a Symbolic Validator, which also functions as a failure detector by aligning expected and observed world states. Our evaluation against baseline methods demonstrates the consistent significant advantages of integrating hierarchical planning, symbolic verification, and RAG across tasks of varying complexity and different LLMs. Additionally, our experimental setup and novel metrics not only validate our approach for complex planning but also serve as a tool for assessing LLMs' reasoning and compositional capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Studying deception in AI agents is important and difficult due to the lack of model organisms and sandboxes that elicit the behavior without asking the model to act under specific conditions or inserting intentional backdoors. Extending upon $\textit{AmongAgents}$, a text-based social-deduction game environment, we aim to fix this by introducing Among Us as a rich sandbox where LLM-agents exhibit human-style deception naturally while they think, speak, and act with other agents or humans. We introduce Deception ELO as an unbounded measure of deceptive capability, suggesting that frontier models win more because they're better at deception, not at detecting it. We evaluate the effectiveness of AI safety techniques (LLM-monitoring of outputs, linear probes on various datasets, and sparse autoencoders) for detecting lying and deception in Among Us, and find that they generalize very well out-of-distribution. We open-source our sandbox as a benchmark for future alignment research and hope that this is a good testbed to improve safety techniques to detect and remove agentically-motivated deception, and to anticipate deceptive abilities in LLMs.

  To reduce the cost and consumption of computing resources caused by computational redundancy and delayed reward assignment in long CoT, this research proposes the dynamic chain-of-thought (D-CoT) with adaptive reasoning time and steps. The researcher used simulation experiment to simulate the integration of D-CoT through Python 3.13 IDLE combined with a Python simulator based on GPTs. At the same time, the researcher used DeepSeek R1 as a control group to test and compare the performance of the D-CoT simulator in processing MIT OpenCourseWare's linear algebra exam questions. Experimental results show that D-CoT is better than DeepSeek R1 based on long CoT in three indicators: reasoning time, CoT length (reasoning steps) and token count, which achieves a significant reduction in computing resource consumption. In addition, this research has potential value in deep reasoning optimization that is used as a reference for future dynamic deep reasoning frameworks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Utilizing large language models (LLMs) for tool planning has emerged as a promising avenue for developing general AI systems, where LLMs automatically schedule external tools (e.g. vision models) to tackle complex tasks based on task descriptions. To push this paradigm toward practical applications, it is crucial for LLMs to consider tool execution costs (e.g. execution time) for tool planning. Unfortunately, prior studies overlook the tool execution costs, leading to the generation of expensive plans of which the costs outweigh task performance. To fill this gap, we propose the Cost-Aware Tool Planning with LLMs (CATP-LLM) framework, which for the first time provides a coherent design to empower LLMs for cost-aware tool planning. Specifically, CATP-LLM incorporates a tool planning language to enhance the LLM to generate non-sequential plans of multiple branches for efficient concurrent tool execution and cost reduction. Moreover, it further designs a cost-aware offline reinforcement learning algorithm to fine-tune the LLM to optimize the performance-cost trade-off in tool planning. In lack of public cost-related datasets, we further present OpenCATP, the first platform for cost-aware planning evaluation. Experiments on OpenCATP show that CATP-LLM outperforms GPT-4 even when using Llama2-7B as its backbone, with the average improvement of 28.2%-30.2% higher plan performance and 24.7%-45.8% lower costs even on the challenging planning tasks.

  This paper describes a cascading multimodal pipeline for high-resolution biodiversity mapping across Europe, integrating species distribution modeling, biodiversity indicators, and habitat classification. The proposed pipeline first predicts species compositions using a deep-SDM, a multimodal model trained on remote sensing, climate time series, and species occurrence data at 50x50m resolution. These predictions are then used to generate biodiversity indicator maps and classify habitats with Pl@ntBERT, a transformer-based LLM designed for species-to-habitat mapping. With this approach, continental-scale species distribution maps, biodiversity indicator maps, and habitat maps are produced, providing fine-grained ecological insights. Unlike traditional methods, this framework enables joint modeling of interspecies dependencies, bias-aware training with heterogeneous presence-absence data, and large-scale inference from multi-source remote sensing inputs.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with web search capabilities have demonstrated impressive potential for deep research tasks. However, current approaches predominantly rely on either manually engineered prompts (prompt engineering-based) with brittle performance or reinforcement learning within controlled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) environments (RAG-based) that fail to capture the complexities of real-world interaction. In this paper, we introduce DeepResearcher, the first comprehensive framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based deep research agents through scaling reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world environments with authentic web search interactions. Unlike RAG-based approaches that assume all necessary information exists within a fixed corpus, our method trains agents to navigate the noisy, unstructured, and dynamic nature of the open web. We implement a specialized multi-agent architecture where browsing agents extract relevant information from various webpage structures and overcoming significant technical challenges. Extensive experiments on open-domain research tasks demonstrate that DeepResearcher achieves substantial improvements of up to 28.9 points over prompt engineering-based baselines and up to 7.2 points over RAG-based RL agents. Our qualitative analysis reveals emergent cognitive behaviors from end-to-end RL training, including the ability to formulate plans, cross-validate information from multiple sources, engage in self-reflection to redirect research, and maintain honesty when unable to find definitive answers. Our results highlight that end-to-end training in real-world web environments is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental requirement for developing robust research capabilities aligned with real-world applications.

  LLM-based judges have emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation and are increasingly used to assess, compare, and improve models. However, the reliability of LLM-based judges themselves is rarely scrutinized. As LLMs become more advanced, their responses grow more sophisticated, requiring stronger judges to evaluate them. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on a judge's alignment with human preferences, but often fail to account for more challenging tasks where crowdsourced human preference is a poor indicator of factual and logical correctness. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to objectively evaluate LLM-based judges. Based on this framework, we propose JudgeBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judges on challenging response pairs spanning knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. JudgeBench leverages a novel pipeline for converting existing difficult datasets into challenging response pairs with preference labels reflecting objective correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation on a collection of prompted judges, fine-tuned judges, multi-agent judges, and reward models shows that JudgeBench poses a significantly greater challenge than previous benchmarks, with many strong models (e.g., GPT-4o) performing just slightly better than random guessing. Overall, JudgeBench offers a reliable platform for assessing increasingly advanced LLM-based judges. Data and code are available atthis https URL.

  We investigate the presence of cognitive biases in three large language models (LLMs): GPT-4o, Gemma 2, and Llama 3.1. The study uses 1,500 experiments across nine established cognitive biases to evaluate the models' responses and consistency. GPT-4o demonstrated the strongest overall performance. Gemma 2 showed strengths in addressing the sunk cost fallacy and prospect theory, however its performance varied across different biases. Llama 3.1 consistently underperformed, relying on heuristics and exhibiting frequent inconsistencies and contradictions. The findings highlight the challenges of achieving robust and generalizable reasoning in LLMs, and underscore the need for further development to mitigate biases in artificial general intelligence (AGI). The study emphasizes the importance of integrating statistical reasoning and ethical considerations in future AI development.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A persistent challenge in AI is the effective integration of material and formal inference - the former concerning the plausibility and contextual relevance of arguments, while the latter focusing on their logical and structural validity. Large Language Models (LLMs), by virtue of their extensive pre-training on large textual corpora, exhibit strong capabilities in material inference. However, their reasoning often lacks formal rigour and verifiability. At the same time, LLMs' linguistic competence positions them as a promising bridge between natural and formal languages, opening up new opportunities for combining these two modes of reasoning. In this paper, we introduce PEIRCE, a neuro-symbolic framework designed to unify material and formal inference through an iterative conjecture-criticism process. Within this framework, LLMs play the central role of generating candidate solutions in natural and formal languages, which are then evaluated and refined via interaction with external critique models. These critiques include symbolic provers, which assess formal validity, as well as soft evaluators that measure the quality of the generated arguments along linguistic and epistemic dimensions such as plausibility, coherence, and parsimony. While PEIRCE is a general-purpose framework, we demonstrate its capabilities in the domain of natural language explanation generation - a setting that inherently demands both material adequacy and formal correctness.

  We introduce PaperBench, a benchmark evaluating the ability of AI agents to replicate state-of-the-art AI research. Agents must replicate 20 ICML 2024 Spotlight and Oral papers from scratch, including understanding paper contributions, developing a codebase, and successfully executing experiments. For objective evaluation, we develop rubrics that hierarchically decompose each replication task into smaller sub-tasks with clear grading criteria. In total, PaperBench contains 8,316 individually gradable tasks. Rubrics are co-developed with the author(s) of each ICML paper for accuracy and realism. To enable scalable evaluation, we also develop an LLM-based judge to automatically grade replication attempts against rubrics, and assess our judge's performance by creating a separate benchmark for judges. We evaluate several frontier models on PaperBench, finding that the best-performing tested agent, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New) with open-source scaffolding, achieves an average replication score of 21.0%. Finally, we recruit top ML PhDs to attempt a subset of PaperBench, finding that models do not yet outperform the human baseline. We open-source our code (this https URL) to facilitate future research in understanding the AI engineering capabilities of AI agents.

  Agents built on LLMs are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, automating complex decision-making and task execution. However, their autonomy introduces safety risks, including security vulnerabilities, legal violations, and unintended harmful actions. Existing mitigation methods, such as model-based safeguards and early enforcement strategies, fall short in robustness, interpretability, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose AgentSpec, a lightweight domain-specific language for specifying and enforcing runtime constraints on LLM agents. With AgentSpec, users define structured rules that incorporate triggers, predicates, and enforcement mechanisms, ensuring agents operate within predefined safety boundaries. We implement AgentSpec across multiple domains, including code execution, embodied agents, and autonomous driving, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that AgentSpec successfully prevents unsafe executions in over 90% of code agent cases, eliminates all hazardous actions in embodied agent tasks, and enforces 100% compliance by autonomous vehicles (AVs). Despite its strong safety guarantees, AgentSpec remains computationally lightweight, with overheads in milliseconds. By combining interpretability, modularity, and efficiency, AgentSpec provides a practical and scalable solution for enforcing LLM agent safety across diverse applications. We also automate the generation of rules using LLMs and assess their effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that the rules generated by OpenAI o1 achieve a precision of 95.56% and recall of 70.96% for embodied agents, successfully identifying 87.26% of the risky code, and prevent AVs from breaking laws in 5 out of 8 scenarios.

  Time series data is ubiquitous across various domains, including manufacturing, finance, and healthcare. High-quality annotations are essential for effectively understanding time series and facilitating downstream tasks; however, obtaining such annotations is challenging, particularly in mission-critical domains. In this paper, we propose TESSA, a multi-agent system designed to automatically generate both general and domain-specific annotations for time series data. TESSA introduces two agents: a general annotation agent and a domain-specific annotation agent. The general agent captures common patterns and knowledge across multiple source domains, leveraging both time-series-wise and text-wise features to generate general annotations. Meanwhile, the domain-specific agent utilizes limited annotations from the target domain to learn domain-specific terminology and generate targeted annotations. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TESSA effectively generates high-quality annotations, outperforming existing methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study investigates uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs) for medical applications, emphasizing both technical innovations and philosophical implications. As LLMs become integral to clinical decision-making, accurately communicating uncertainty is crucial for ensuring reliable, safe, and ethical AI-assisted healthcare. Our research frames uncertainty not as a barrier but as an essential part of knowledge that invites a dynamic and reflective approach to AI design. By integrating advanced probabilistic methods such as Bayesian inference, deep ensembles, and Monte Carlo dropout with linguistic analysis that computes predictive and semantic entropy, we propose a comprehensive framework that manages both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. The framework incorporates surrogate modeling to address limitations of proprietary APIs, multi-source data integration for better context, and dynamic calibration via continual and meta-learning. Explainability is embedded through uncertainty maps and confidence metrics to support user trust and clinical interpretability. Our approach supports transparent and ethical decision-making aligned with Responsible and Reflective AI principles. Philosophically, we advocate accepting controlled ambiguity instead of striving for absolute predictability, recognizing the inherent provisionality of medical knowledge.

  Knowledge Graph based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Model (LLM) inference in tasks like Question Answering (QA) by retrieving relevant information from knowledge graphs (KGs). However, real-world KGs are often incomplete, meaning that essential information for answering questions may be missing. Existing benchmarks do not adequately capture the impact of KG incompleteness on KG-RAG performance. In this paper, we systematically evaluate KG-RAG methods under incomplete KGs by removing triples using different methods and analyzing the resulting effects. We demonstrate that KG-RAG methods are sensitive to KG incompleteness, highlighting the need for more robust approaches in realistic settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multiagent collaboration has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While this approach improves reasoning capability, it incurs substantial computational overhead due to iterative agent interactions. Furthermore, engaging in debates for queries that do not necessitate collaboration amplifies the risk of error generation. To address these challenges, we propose Debate Only When Necessary (DOWN), an adaptive multiagent debate framework that selectively activates the debate process based on the confidence score of the agent's initial response. For queries where debate is triggered, agents refine their outputs using responses from participating agents and their confidence scores. Experimental results demonstrate that this mechanism significantly improves efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of existing multiagent debate systems. We also find that confidence-guided debate mitigates error propagation and enhances the selective incorporation of reliable responses. These results establish DOWN as an optimization strategy for efficient and effective multiagent reasoning, facilitating the practical deployment of LLM-based collaboration.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting biases in structured data is a complex and time-consuming task. Existing automated techniques are limited in diversity of data types and heavily reliant on human case-by-case handling, resulting in a lack of generalizability. Currently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have made significant progress in data science, but their ability to detect data biases is still insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we introduce the first end-to-end, multi-agent synergy framework, BIASINSPECTOR, designed for automatic bias detection in structured data based on specific user requirements. It first develops a multi-stage plan to analyze user-specified bias detection tasks and then implements it with a diverse and well-suited set of tools. It delivers detailed results that include explanations and visualizations. To address the lack of a standardized framework for evaluating the capability of LLM agents to detect biases in data, we further propose a comprehensive benchmark that includes multiple evaluation metrics and a large set of test cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves exceptional overall performance in structured data bias detection, setting a new milestone for fairer data applications.

  Efficiently leveraging of the capabilities of contemporary large language models (LLMs) is increasingly challenging, particularly when direct fine-tuning is expensive and often impractical. Existing training-free methods, including manually or automated designed workflows, typically demand substantial human effort or yield suboptimal results. This paper proposes Weak-for-Strong Harnessing (W4S), a novel framework that customizes smaller, cost-efficient language models to design and optimize workflows for harnessing stronger models. W4S formulates workflow design as a multi-turn markov decision process and introduces reinforcement learning for agentic workflow optimization (RLAO) to train a weak meta-agent. Through iterative interaction with the environment, the meta-agent learns to design increasingly effective workflows without manual intervention. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of W4S that our 7B meta-agent, trained with just one GPU hour, outperforms the strongest baseline by 2.9% ~ 24.6% across eleven benchmarks, successfully elevating the performance of state-of-the-art models such as GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o. Notably, W4S exhibits strong generalization capabilities across both seen and unseen tasks, offering an efficient, high-performing alternative to directly fine-tuning strong models.

  Current large language models (LLMs) are constrained by human-derived training data and limited by a single level of abstraction that impedes definitive truth judgments. This paper introduces a novel framework in which AI models autonomously generate and validate new knowledge through direct interaction with their environment. Central to this approach is an unbounded, ungamable numeric reward - such as annexed disk space or follower count - that guides learning without requiring human benchmarks. AI agents iteratively generate strategies and executable code to maximize this metric, with successful outcomes forming the basis for self-retraining and incremental generalisation. To mitigate model collapse and the warm start problem, the framework emphasizes empirical validation over textual similarity and supports fine-tuning via GRPO. The system architecture employs modular agents for environment analysis, strategy generation, and code synthesis, enabling scalable experimentation. This work outlines a pathway toward self-improving AI systems capable of advancing beyond human-imposed constraints toward autonomous general intelligence.

  Despite remarkable progress in machine learning, current AI systems continue to fall short of true human-like intelligence. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in pattern recognition and response generation, they lack genuine understanding - an essential hallmark of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Existing AGI evaluation methods fail to offer a practical, gradual, and informative metric. This paper introduces the Artificial General Intelligence Test Bed (AGITB), comprising twelve rigorous tests that form a signal-processing-level foundation for the potential emergence of cognitive capabilities. AGITB evaluates intelligence through a model's ability to predict binary signals across time without relying on symbolic representations or pretraining. Unlike high-level tests grounded in language or perception, AGITB focuses on core computational invariants reflective of biological intelligence, such as determinism, sensitivity, and generalisation. The test bed assumes no prior bias, operates independently of semantic meaning, and ensures unsolvability through brute force or memorization. While humans pass AGITB by design, no current AI system has met its criteria, making AGITB a compelling benchmark for guiding and recognizing progress toward AGI.

  Zero-shot learning (ZL) is crucial for tasks involving unseen categories, such as natural language processing, image classification, and cross-lingualthis http URLapplications often fail to accurately infer and handle new relations orentities involving unseen categories, severely limiting their scalability and prac-ticality in open-domain scenarios. ZL learning faces the challenge of effectivelytransferring semantic information of unseen categories in multi-modal knowledgegraph (MMKG) embedding representation learning. In this paper, we proposeZSLLM, a framework for zero-shot embedding learning of MMKGs using largelanguage models (LLMs). We leverage textual modality information of unseencategories as prompts to fully utilize the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enablingsemantic information transfer across different modalities for unseenthis http URLmodel-based learning, the embedding representation of unseen cate-gories in MMKG is enhanced. Extensive experiments conducted on multiplereal-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared tostate-of-the-art methods.

  Fine-tuning has emerged as a critical process in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific downstream tasks, enabling these models to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various domains. However, the fine-tuning process often involves sensitive datasets, introducing privacy risks that exploit the unique characteristics of this stage. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of privacy challenges associated with fine-tuning LLMs, highlighting vulnerabilities to various privacy attacks, including membership inference, data extraction, and backdoor attacks. We further review defense mechanisms designed to mitigate privacy risks in the fine-tuning phase, such as differential privacy, federated learning, and knowledge unlearning, discussing their effectiveness and limitations in addressing privacy risks and maintaining model utility. By identifying key gaps in existing research, we highlight challenges and propose directions to advance the development of privacy-preserving methods for fine-tuning LLMs, promoting their responsible use in diverse applications.

  The advancements in cloud-based Large Languages Models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI-assisted programming. However, their integration into certain local development environments like ones within the Apple software ecosystem (e.g., iOS apps, macOS) remains challenging due to computational demands and sandboxed constraints. This paper presents CAMP, a multi-model AI-assisted programming framework that consists of a local model that employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve contextual information from the codebase to facilitate context-aware prompt construction thus optimizing the performance of the cloud model, empowering LLMs' capabilities in local Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). The methodology is actualized in Copilot for Xcode, an AI-assisted programming tool crafted for Xcode that employs the RAG module to address software constraints and enables diverse generative programming tasks, including automatic code completion, documentation, error detection, and intelligent user-agent interaction. The results from objective experiments on generated code quality and subjective experiments on user adoption collectively demonstrate the pilot success of the proposed system and mark its significant contributions to the realm of AI-assisted programming.
