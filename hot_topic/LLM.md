  Rare, yet critical, scenarios pose a significant challenge in testing and evaluating autonomous driving planners. Relying solely on real-world driving scenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While automatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models require extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the output. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a distributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the validity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep this, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting original scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual augmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet the demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting real-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing the limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic design, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high performance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert evaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user intent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created manually.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential in improving coding education by providing support for code writing, explanation, and debugging. However, existing LLM-based approaches generally fail to assess students' abilities, design learning plans, provide personalized material aligned with individual learning goals, and enable interactive learning. Current work mostly uses single LLM agents, which limits their ability to understand complex code repositories and schedule step-by-step tutoring. Recent research has shown that multi-agent LLMs can collaborate to solve complicated problems in various domains like software engineering, but their potential in the field of education remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce CodeEdu, an innovative multi-agent collaborative platform that combines LLMs with tool use to provide proactive and personalized education in coding. Unlike static pipelines, CodeEdu dynamically allocates agents and tasks to meet student needs. Various agents in CodeEdu undertake certain functions specifically, including task planning, personalized material generation, real-time QA, step-by-step tutoring, code execution, debugging, and learning report generation, facilitated with extensive external tools to improve task efficiency. Automated evaluations reveal that CodeEdu substantially enhances students' coding performance.

  Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan to open-source the entire framework.

  Current text-to-image (T2I) models often fail to account for diverse human experiences, leading to misaligned systems. We advocate for pluralistic alignment, where an AI understands and is steerable towards diverse, and often conflicting, human values. Our work provides three core contributions to achieve this in T2I models. First, we introduce a novel dataset for Diverse Intersectional Visual Evaluation (DIVE) -- the first multimodal dataset for pluralistic alignment. It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives through a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who provided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication, capturing nuanced safety perceptions. Second, we empirically confirm demographics as a crucial proxy for diverse viewpoints in this domain, revealing significant, context-dependent differences in harm perception that diverge from conventional evaluations. Finally, we discuss implications for building aligned T2I models, including efficient data collection strategies, LLM judgment capabilities, and model steerability towards diverse perspectives. This research offers foundational tools for more equitable and aligned T2I systems. Content Warning: The paper includes sensitive content that may be harmful.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning is now widely adopted as the final stage of large language model training, especially for reasoning-style tasks such as maths problems. Typically, models attempt each question many times during a single training step and attempt to learn from their successes and failures. However, we demonstrate that throughout training with two popular algorithms (PPO and VinePPO) on two widely used datasets, many questions are either solved by all attempts - meaning they are already learned - or by none - providing no meaningful training signal. To address this, we adapt a method from the reinforcement learning literature - sampling for learnability - and apply it to the reinforcement learning stage of LLM training. Our curriculum prioritises questions with high variance of success, i.e. those where the agent sometimes succeeds, but not always. Our findings demonstrate that this curriculum consistently boosts training performance across multiple algorithms and datasets, paving the way for more efficient and effective reinforcement learning with LLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel across various tasks, but standard first-order (FO) fine-tuning demands considerable memory, significantly limiting real-world deployment. Recently, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization stood out as a promising memory-efficient training paradigm, avoiding backward passes and relying solely on forward passes for gradient estimation, making it attractive for resource-constrained scenarios. However, ZO method lags far behind FO method in both convergence speed and accuracy. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel layer-wise divergence analysis that uncovers the distinct update pattern of FO and ZO optimization. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FO method from the findings, we propose Divergence-driven Zeroth-Order (DiZO) optimization. DiZO conducts divergence-driven layer adaptation by incorporating projections to ZO updates, generating diverse-magnitude updates precisely scaled to layer-wise individual optimization needs. Our results demonstrate that DiZO significantly reduces the needed iterations for convergence without sacrificing throughput, cutting training GPU hours by up to 48% on various datasets. Moreover, DiZO consistently outperforms the representative ZO baselines in fine-tuning RoBERTa-large, OPT-series, and Llama-series on downstream tasks and, in some cases, even surpasses memory-intensive FO fine-tuning. Our code is released atthis https URL.

  As everyday use cases of large language model (LLM) AI assistants have expanded, it is becoming increasingly important to personalize responses to align to different users' preferences and goals. While reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is effective at improving LLMs to be generally more helpful and fluent, it does not account for variability across users, as it models the entire user population with a single reward model. We present a novel framework, Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), that learns text-based summaries of each user's preferences, characteristics, and past conversations. These summaries condition the reward model, enabling it to make personalized predictions about the types of responses valued by each user. We train the user-summarization model with reinforcement learning, and update the reward model simultaneously, creating an online co-adaptation loop. We show that in contrast with prior personalized RLHF techniques or with in-context learning of user information, summaries produced by PLUS capture meaningful aspects of a user's preferences. Across different pluralistic user datasets, we show that our method is robust to new users and diverse conversation topics. Additionally, we demonstrate that the textual summaries generated about users can be transferred for zero-shot personalization of stronger, proprietary models like GPT-4. The resulting user summaries are not only concise and portable, they are easy for users to interpret and modify, allowing for more transparency and user control in LLM alignment.

- **[Understanding Reasoning in Thinking Language Models via Steering Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18167)**  `arXiv:2506.18167`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance, controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using three DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different model architectures.

  Large language models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized language processing tasks but have also brought ethical and legal issues. LLMs have a tendency to memorize potentially private or copyrighted information present in the training data, which might then be delivered to end users at inference time. When this happens, a naive solution is to retrain the model from scratch after excluding the undesired data. Although this guarantees that the target data have been forgotten, it is also prohibitively expensive for LLMs. Approximate unlearning offers a more efficient alternative, as it consists of ex post modifications of the trained model itself to prevent undesirable results, but it lacks forgetting guarantees because it relies solely on empirical evidence. In this work, we present DP2Unlearning, a novel LLM unlearning framework that offers formal forgetting guarantees at a significantly lower cost than retraining from scratch on the data to be retained. DP2Unlearning involves training LLMs on textual data protected using {\epsilon}-differential privacy (DP), which later enables efficient unlearning with the guarantees against disclosure associated with the chosen {\epsilon}. Our experiments demonstrate that DP2Unlearning achieves similar model performance post-unlearning, compared to an LLM retraining from scratch on retained data -- the gold standard exact unlearning -- but at approximately half the unlearning cost. In addition, with a reasonable computational cost, it outperforms approximate unlearning methods at both preserving the utility of the model post-unlearning and effectively forgetting the targeted information.

- **[DPMT: Dual Process Multi-scale Theory of Mind Framework for Real-time Human-AI Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14088)**  `arXiv:2507.14088`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-time human-artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration is crucial yet challenging, especially when AI agents must adapt to diverse and unseen human behaviors in dynamic scenarios. Existing large language model (LLM) agents often fail to accurately model the complex human mental characteristics such as domain intentions, especially in the absence of direct communication. To address this limitation, we propose a novel dual process multi-scale theory of mind (DPMT) framework, drawing inspiration from cognitive science dual process theory. Our DPMT framework incorporates a multi-scale theory of mind (ToM) module to facilitate robust human partner modeling through mental characteristic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that DPMT significantly enhances human-AI collaboration, and ablation studies further validate the contributions of our multi-scale ToM in the slow system.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire new behaviors from the input sequence alone without any parameter updates. Recent studies have shown that ICL can surpass the original meaning learned in pretraining stage through internalizing the structure the data-generating process (DGP) of the prompt into the hidden representations. However, the mechanisms by which LLMs achieve this ability is left open. In this paper, we present the first rigorous explanation of such phenomena by introducing a unified framework of double convergence, where hidden representations converge both over context and across layers. This double convergence process leads to an implicit bias towards smooth (low-frequency) representations, which we prove analytically and verify empirically. Our theory explains several open empirical observations, including why learned representations exhibit globally structured but locally distorted geometry, and why their total energy decays without vanishing. Moreover, our theory predicts that ICL has an intrinsic robustness towards high-frequency noise, which we empirically confirm. These results provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of ICL, and a theoretical foundation to study it that hopefully extends to more general data distributions and settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Interpretability can improve the safety, transparency and trust of AI models, which is especially important in healthcare applications where decisions often carry significant consequences. Mechanistic interpretability, particularly through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models. In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range of clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper mechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted multimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model transparency. We release the trained SAEs and interpretations:this https URL.

- **[FireQ: Fast INT4-FP8 Kernel and RoPE-aware Quantization for LLM Inference Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20839)**  `arXiv:2505.20839`  `cs.LG`  
  _Daehyeon Baek, Jieun Choi, Jimyoung Son, Kyungmin Bin, Seungbeom Choi, Kihyo Moon, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models become increasingly prevalent, memory bandwidth constraints significantly limit inference throughput, motivating post-training quantization (PTQ). In this paper, we propose FireQ, a co-designed PTQ framework and an INT4-FP8 matrix multiplication kernel that accelerates LLM inference across all linear layers. Specifically, FireQ quantizes linear layer weights and key-values to INT4, and activations and queries to FP8, significantly enhancing throughput. Additionally, we introduce a three-stage pipelining for the prefill phase, which modifies the FlashAttention-3 kernel, effectively reducing time-to-first-token in the prefill phase. To minimize accuracy loss from quantization, we develop novel outlier smoothing techniques tailored separately for linear and attention layers. In linear layers, we explicitly use per-tensor scaling to prevent underflow caused by the FP8 quantization scaling factor of INT4 quantization, and channel-wise scaling to compensate for coarse granularity of INT4. In attention layers, we address quantization challenges posed by rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) by combining pre-RoPE and post-RoPE scaling strategies. FireQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.68x faster inference in feed-forward network layers on Llama2-7B and 1.26x faster prefill phase performance on Llama3-8B compared to QServe, with negligible accuracy loss.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite recent progress in video large language models (VideoLLMs), a key open challenge remains: how to equip models with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning abilities grounded in fine-grained object-level video understanding. Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks: Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks, a new framework that decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR) into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking, spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance: LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal (+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for improving compositional video reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation (MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report pairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these data is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding model development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address this challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of LLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge of communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity. To start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication overhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently decompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs and making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings. Furthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario: varying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse reporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further enhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder, coupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally generalizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic accuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder that harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in reporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our established FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and adaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center data and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication efficiency.

  Building Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents which can navigate following natural language instructions is a long-standing goal in human-robot interaction applications. Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for improving navigation, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches primarily adopt direct input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning framework for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation, dubbed EvolveNav. Our EvolveNav consists of two stages: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with formalized CoT labels to both activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities and increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also introduced to encourage learning correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results on the popular VLN benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of EvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches. Code is available atthis https URL.

- **[On Pre-training of Multimodal Language Models Customized for Chart Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14506)**  `arXiv:2407.14506`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Wan-Cyuan Fan, Yen-Chun Chen, Mengchen Liu, Lu Yuan, Leonid Sigal_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies customizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for domain-specific tasks have yielded promising results, especially in the field of scientific chart comprehension. These studies generally utilize visual instruction tuning with specialized datasets to enhance question and answer (QA) accuracy within the chart domain. However, they often neglect the fundamental discrepancy between natural image-caption pre-training data and digital chart image-QA data, particularly in the models' capacity to extract underlying numeric values from charts. This paper tackles this oversight by exploring the training processes necessary to improve MLLMs' comprehension of charts. We present three key findings: (1) Incorporating raw data values in alignment pre-training markedly improves comprehension of chart data. (2) Replacing images with their textual representation randomly during end-to-end fine-tuning transfer the language reasoning capability to chart interpretation skills. (3) Requiring the model to first extract the underlying chart data and then answer the question in the fine-tuning can further improve the accuracy. Consequently, we introduce CHOPINLLM, an MLLM tailored for in-depth chart comprehension. CHOPINLLM effectively interprets various types of charts, including unannotated ones, while maintaining robust reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of different chart types across various comprehension levels. Experimental results show that CHOPINLLM exhibits strong performance in understanding both annotated and unannotated charts across a wide range of types.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel framework for open-ended video question answering that enhances reasoning depth and robustness in complex real-world scenarios, as benchmarked on the CVRR-ES dataset. Existing Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs) often exhibit limited contextual understanding, weak temporal modeling, and poor generalization to ambiguous or compositional queries. To address these challenges, we introduce a prompting-and-response integration mechanism that coordinates multiple heterogeneous Video-Language Models (VLMs) via structured chains of thought, each tailored to distinct reasoning pathways. An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator, selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across all evaluation metrics, showcasing superior generalization and robustness. Our approach offers a lightweight, extensible strategy for advancing multimodal reasoning without requiring model retraining, setting a strong foundation for future Video-LMM development.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in creating high-quality, photorealistic content. However, their ability to accurately simulate physical phenomena remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This paper presents PhyWorldBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion. Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency. Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050 curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles.

  _Shmuel Berman, Jia Deng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Language Models (VLMs) excel at complex visual tasks such as VQA and chart understanding, yet recent work suggests they struggle with simple perceptual tests. We present an evaluation that tests vision-language models' capacity for nonlocal visual reasoning -- reasoning that requires chaining evidence collected from multiple, possibly distant, regions of an image. We isolate three distinct forms of non-local vision: comparative perception, which demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves searching smoothly along a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini), even those that perform well on prior primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans. Our structured evaluation suite allows us to test if VLMs can perform similar visual algorithms to humans. Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bridging emotions and visual content for emotion-driven image editing holds great potential in creative industries, yet precise manipulation remains challenging due to the abstract nature of emotions and their varied manifestations across different contexts. We tackle this challenge with an integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes. Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry, and home d√©cor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications. We will release the MoodArchive dataset, MoodifyCLIP model, and make the Moodifier code and demo publicly available upon acceptance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating 3D scenes from natural language holds great promise for applications in gaming, film, and design. However, existing methods struggle with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and 4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution for open-domain 3D content creation. Code and demos are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent extensive works have demonstrated that by introducing long CoT, the capabilities of MLLMs to solve complex problems can be effectively enhanced. However, the reasons for the effectiveness of such paradigms remain unclear. It is challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's specific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning during inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore, evaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is crucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and controllable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1. It enables the automatic and precise editing of specific visual cues based on the instruction. Furthermore, we introduce VFaith-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' visual reasoning capabilities and analyze the source of such capabilities with an emphasis on the visual faithfulness. Using the designed pipeline, we constructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in images that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby changing the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that have different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual reasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing the test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's reasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics to expose this relationship. VFaith-Bench includes 755 entries divided into five distinct subsets, along with an additional human-labeled perception task. We conducted in-depth testing and analysis of existing mainstream flagship models and prominent open-source model series/reasoning models on VFaith-Bench, further investigating the underlying factors of their reasoning capabilities.

  We introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. RHYTHM partitions trajectories into daily segments encoded as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention, capturing both daily and weekly dependencies while substantially reducing the sequence length. Token representations are enriched with pre-computed prompt embeddings via a frozen LLM, enhancing the model's ability to capture interdependencies without extensive computational overhead. By freezing the LLM backbone, RHYTHM achieves significant computational efficiency. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates a 2.4% improvement in accuracy, 5.0% increase on weekends, and 24.6% reduction in training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study examines the role of human judges in legal decision-making by using machine learning to predict child physical custody outcomes in French appellate courts. Building on the legal realism-formalism debate, we test whether individual judges' decision-making patterns significantly influence case outcomes, challenging the assumption that judges are neutral variables that apply the law uniformly. To ensure compliance with French privacy laws, we implement a strict pseudonymization process. Our analysis uses 18,937 living arrangements rulings extracted from 10,306 cases. We compare models trained on individual judges' past rulings (specialist models) with a judge-agnostic model trained on aggregated data (generalist models). The prediction pipeline is a hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) for structured feature extraction and ML models for outcome prediction (RF, XGB and SVC). Our results show that specialist models consistently achieve higher predictive accuracy than the general model, with top-performing models reaching F1 scores as high as 92.85%, compared to the generalist model's 82.63% trained on 20x to 100x more samples. Specialist models capture stable individual patterns that are not transferable to other judges. In-Domain and Cross-Domain validity tests provide empirical support for legal realism, demonstrating that judicial identity plays a measurable role in legal outcomes. All data and code used will be made available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful general-purpose reasoning systems, yet their development remains dominated by English-centric data, architectures, and optimization paradigms. This exclusionary design results in structural under-representation of linguistically diverse regions such as India, where over 20 official languages and 100+ dialects coexist alongside phenomena like code-switching and diglossia. We introduce PARAM-1, a 2.9B parameter decoder-only, text-only language model trained from scratch with an explicit architectural and linguistic focus on Indian diversity. PARAM-1 is trained on a bilingual dataset consisting of only Hindi and English, constructed with a strong focus on fact-rich, high-quality content. It is guided by three core principles: equitable representation of Indic languages through a 25% corpus allocation; tokenization fairness via a SentencePiece tokenizer adapted to Indian morphological structures; and culturally aligned evaluation benchmarks across IndicQA, code-mixed reasoning, and socio-linguistic robustness tasks. By embedding diversity at the pretraining level-rather than deferring it to post-hoc alignment-PARAM-1 offers a design-first blueprint for equitable foundation modeling. Our results demonstrate that it serves as both a competent general-purpose model and a robust baseline for India-centric applications.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to tasks involving structured inputs such as graphs. Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs), which encode rich semantics as directed graphs, offer a rigorous testbed for evaluating LLMs on text generation from such structures. Yet, current methods often arbitrarily linearize AMRs, discarding key structural cues, or rely on architectures incompatible with standard LLMs. We introduce SAFT, a structure-aware fine-tuning approach that injects graph topology into pretrained LLMs without architectural changes. We compute direction-sensitive positional encodings from the magnetic Laplacian of transformed AMRs and project them into the embedding space of the LLM. While possibly applicable to any graph-structured inputs, we focus on AMR-to-text generation as a representative and challenging benchmark. SAFT sets a new state-of-the-art on AMR 3.0 with a 3.5 BLEU improvement over baselines. Gains scale with graph complexity, highlighting the value of structure-aware representations in enhancing LLM performance. SAFT offers a general and effective pathway for bridging structured data and language models.

  psifx is a plug-and-play multi-modal feature extraction toolkit, aiming to facilitate and democratize the use of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for human sciences research. It is motivated by a need (a) to automate and standardize data annotation processes that typically require expensive, lengthy, and inconsistent human labour; (b) to develop and distribute open-source community-driven psychology research software; and (c) to enable large-scale access and ease of use for non-expert users. The framework contains an array of tools for tasks such as speaker diarization, closed-caption transcription and translation from audio; body, hand, and facial pose estimation and gaze tracking with multi-person tracking from video; and interactive textual feature extraction supported by large language models. The package has been designed with a modular and task-oriented approach, enabling the community to add or update new tools easily. This combination creates new opportunities for in-depth study of real-time behavioral phenomena in psychological and social science research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging extensive pre-training and fine-tuning to achieve high accuracy. However, like humans, LLMs exhibit biases, particularly positional biases such as primacy and recency effects, which can influence the accuracy of the answers. The primacy effect-where items presented first are more likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect prediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We first show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to human-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring knowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this approach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our findings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and opportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP applications.

  Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a \href{this https URL}{new benchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide range of long-context dialogue tasks.

  Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language models (LLMs) to handle intricate language patterns and stilted translations that arise in automated translations. In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual and bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs. Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models, including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and applications.

  The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by LLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either human-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11 different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency length and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition controls and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set of features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show stylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output text that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of machine-generated texts.

  Formal thought disorder (FTD), a hallmark of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, manifests as incoherent speech and poses challenges for clinical assessment. Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are resource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with automatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of linguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The use of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought to reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the utility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity requires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic coherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries (AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream narratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside established coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to predict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone robustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic coherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only models, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to \r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best \r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance gains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all contexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These findings suggest that frameworks combining temporal and semantic analyses provide a roadmap for refining the assessment of disorganized speech and advance automated speech analysis in psychosis.

  Large language models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude have transformed natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as question answering, dialogue generation, summarization, and so forth; yet their susceptibility to hallucination stands as one of the major challenges. Among numerous approaches to overcome this challenge, integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into language models has emerged as a promising solution as it provides structured, reliable, domain-specific, and up-to-date external information to the language models. In this paper, we introduce ALIGNed-LLM, a simple yet effective approach to improve language models' factuality via a lean strategy to infuse KGs into the latent space of language models inspired by LLaVA where visual and textual information is infused. We use embeddings from a pre-trained Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model, such as TransE, and a trainable projection layer to align entity and text embeddings. This alignment enables the language model to distinguish between similar entities improving factual grounding and reducing hallucination. We tested our approach on three popular questions-answering benchmark datasets alongside language models of varying sizes, showing significant improvement. Furthermore, we applied our approach to a real-world financial use case from a large central bank in Europe, which demands high accuracy and precision, demonstrating a substantial improvement of the LLM answers.

  Deterministically controlling the target generation language of large multilingual language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in zero-shot settings where neither explicit language prompts nor fine-tuning are available. In this work, we investigate whether sparse autoencoder (SAE) features, previously shown to correlate with interpretable model behaviors, can be leveraged to steer the generated language of LLMs during inference. Leveraging pretrained SAEs on the residual streams of Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B, we identify features whose activations differ most significantly between English and four target languages: Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and French. By modifying just a single SAE feature at one transformer layer, we achieve controlled language shifts with up to 90\% success, as measured by FastText language classification, while preserving semantic fidelity according to LaBSE (Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding) similarity. Our analysis reveals that language steering is most effective in mid-to-late transformer layers and is amplified by specific attention heads disproportionately associated with language-sensitive SAE features. These results demonstrate the promise of sparse feature steering as a lightweight and interpretable mechanism for controllable multilingual generation.

  We improve the extraction of insights from customer reviews by restructuring the topic modelling pipeline to operate on opinion units - distinct statements that include relevant text excerpts and associated sentiment scores. Prior work has demonstrated that such units can be reliably extracted using large language models. The result is a heightened performance of the subsequent topic modeling, leading to coherent and interpretable topics while also capturing the sentiment associated with each topic. By correlating the topics and sentiments with business metrics, such as star ratings, we can gain insights on how specific customer concerns impact business outcomes. We present our system's implementation, use cases, and advantages over other topic modeling and classification solutions. We also evaluate its effectiveness in creating coherent topics and assess methods for integrating topic and sentiment modalities for accurate star-rating prediction.

  In the field of emotion recognition, the development of high-performance models remains a challenge due to the scarcity of high-quality, diverse emotional datasets. Emotional expressions are inherently subjective, shaped by individual personality traits, socio-cultural backgrounds, and contextual factors, making large-scale, generalizable data collection both ethically and practically difficult. To address this issue, we introduce PersonaGen, a novel framework for generating emotionally rich text using a Large Language Model (LLM) through multi-stage persona-based conditioning. PersonaGen constructs layered virtual personas by combining demographic attributes, socio-cultural backgrounds, and detailed situational contexts, which are then used to guide emotion expression generation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the generated synthetic data, assessing semantic diversity through clustering and distributional metrics, human-likeness via LLM-based quality scoring, realism through comparison with real-world emotion corpora, and practical utility in downstream emotion classification tasks. Experimental results show that PersonaGen significantly outperforms baseline methods in generating diverse, coherent, and discriminative emotion expressions, demonstrating its potential as a robust alternative for augmenting or replacing real-world emotional datasets.

  Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second, we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33% ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.

  We introduce DeepSeek-Prover-V2, an open-source large language model designed for formal theorem proving in Lean 4, with initialization data collected through a recursive theorem proving pipeline powered by DeepSeek-V3. The cold-start training procedure begins by prompting DeepSeek-V3 to decompose complex problems into a series of subgoals. The proofs of resolved subgoals are synthesized into a chain-of-thought process, combined with DeepSeek-V3's step-by-step reasoning, to create an initial cold start for reinforcement learning. This process enables us to integrate both informal and formal mathematical reasoning into a unified model. The resulting model, DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B, achieves state-of-the-art performance in neural theorem proving, reaching 88.9% pass ratio on the MiniF2F-test and solving 49 out of 658 problems from PutnamBench. In addition to standard benchmarks, we introduce ProverBench, a collection of 325 formalized problems, to enrich our evaluation, including 15 selected problems from the recent AIME competitions (years 24-25). Further evaluation on these 15 AIME problems shows that the model successfully solves 6 of them. In comparison, DeepSeek-V3 solves 8 of these problems using majority voting, highlighting that the gap between formal and informal mathematical reasoning in large language models is substantially narrowing.

  While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the knowledge outdating problem in Large Language Models (LLMs), it still faces a critical challenge: the prevalence of outdated information in knowledge bases. Current research primarily focuses on incorporating up-to-date information, yet the impact of outdated information coexisting in retrieval sources remains inadequately addressed. To bridge this gap, we introduce HoH, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of outdated information on RAG. Our benchmark leverages token-level diff algorithms combined with LLM pipelines to efficiently create a large-scale QA dataset that accurately captures the evolution of temporal knowledge in real-world facts. Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that outdated information significantly degrades RAG performance in two critical ways: (1) it substantially reduces response accuracy by distracting models from correct information, and (2) it can mislead models into generating potentially harmful outputs, even when current information is available. Current RAG approaches struggle with both retrieval and generation aspects when handling outdated information. These findings highlight the urgent need for innovative solutions to address the temporal challenges in RAG. Our code and data are available at:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in clinical question answering (QA), with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a leading approach for ensuring the factual accuracy of model responses. However, current automated RAG metrics perform poorly in clinical and conversational use cases. Using clinical human evaluations of responses is expensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterative development of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID - an Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveraging RAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy (RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, is designed to better capture the faithfulness of a model's response to the knowledge base without penalising conversational elements. To validate our triad, we curate a dataset of over 200 real-world patient questions posed to an LLM-based QA agent during surgical follow-up for cataract surgery - the highest volume operation in the world - augmented with clinician-selected questions for emergency, clinical, and non-clinical out-of-domain scenarios. We demonstrate that CF can predict human ratings of faithfulness better than existing definitions for conversational use cases. Furthermore, we show that evaluation using our triad consisting of CF, RA, and CR exhibits alignment with clinician assessment for inappropriate, harmful, or unhelpful responses. Finally, using nine different LLMs, we demonstrate that the three metrics can closely agree with human evaluations, highlighting the potential of these metrics for use in LLM-driven automated evaluation pipelines. We also publish the prompts and datasets for these experiments, providing valuable resources for further research and development.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper explores whether enhancing temporal reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve the quality of timeline summarisation, the task of summarising long texts containing sequences of events, such as social media threads. We first introduce NarrativeReason, a novel dataset focused on temporal relationships among sequential events within narratives, distinguishing it from existing temporal reasoning datasets that primarily address pair-wise event relationships. Our approach then combines temporal reasoning with timeline summarisation through a knowledge distillation framework, where we first fine-tune a teacher model on temporal reasoning tasks and then distill this knowledge into a student model while simultaneously training it for the task of timeline summarisation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on out-of-domain mental health-related timeline summarisation tasks, which involve long social media threads with repetitions of events and a mix of emotions, highlighting the importance and generalisability of leveraging temporal reasoning to improve timeline summarisation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of cost-efficient Large Language Models (LLMs) for diverse biomedical tasks spanning both text and image modalities. We evaluated a range of closed-source and open-source LLMs on tasks such as biomedical text classification and generation, question answering, and multimodal image processing. Our experimental findings indicate that there is no single LLM that can consistently outperform others across all tasks. Instead, different LLMs excel in different tasks. While some closed-source LLMs demonstrate strong performance on specific tasks, their open-source counterparts achieve comparable results (sometimes even better), with additional benefits like faster inference and enhanced privacy. Our experimental results offer valuable insights for selecting models that are optimally suited for specific biomedical applications.

  The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased greatly over the last few years, as have their size and complexity. Nonetheless, the use of LLMs in production remains challenging due to their unpredictable nature and discrepancies that can exist between their desired behavior and their actual model output. In this paper, we introduce a new tool, InTraVisTo (Inside Transformer Visualisation Tool), designed to enable researchers to investigate and trace the computational process that generates each token in a Transformer-based LLM. InTraVisTo provides a visualization of both the internal state of the Transformer model (by decoding token embeddings at each layer of the model) and the information flow between the various components across the different layers of the model (using a Sankey diagram). With InTraVisTo, we aim to help researchers and practitioners better understand the computations being performed within the Transformer model and thus to shed some light on internal patterns and reasoning processes employed by LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective storytelling relies on a delicate balance between meeting the reader's prior expectations and introducing unexpected developments. In the domain of detective fiction, this tension is known as fair play, which includes the implicit agreement between the writer and the reader as to the range of possible resolutions the mystery story may have. In this work, we present a probabilistic framework for detective fiction that allows us to define desired qualities. Using this framework, we formally define fair play and design appropriate metrics for it. Stemming from these definitions is an inherent tension between the coherence of the story, which measures how much it ``makes sense'', and the surprise it induces. We validate the framework by applying it to LLM-generated detective stories. This domain is appealing since we have an abundance of data, we can sample from the distribution generating the story, and the story-writing capabilities of LLMs are interesting in their own right. Results show that while LLM-generated stories may be unpredictable, they generally fail to balance the trade-off between surprise and fair play, which greatly contributes to their poor quality.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, high-performing models are typically accessible only via APIs, incurring substantial inference costs. Cascade methods address this by initially employing a cheaper model and escalating to a stronger one only when necessary. Nevertheless, existing cascade approaches struggle to select a reliable representative response and assess the overall reliability of free-form outputs, as they rely on exact text matching. To overcome these limitations, we propose Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC), a novel framework for cost-efficient free-form text generation. KiC identifies the most representative answer among multiple outputs from a weaker model and evaluates the semantic alignment of other responses with it. Based on the degree of alignment, KiC determines whether to accept the weaker model's output or escalate to a stronger model. Experiments on three free-form text generation benchmarks show that KiC achieves 97.53 percent of GPT-4's accuracy while reducing API costs by 28.81 percent on average, and even outperforms GPT-4 in a specific benchmark.

  _Teerapong Panboonyuen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Integrating large language models into specialized domains like healthcare presents unique challenges, including domain adaptation and limited labeled data. We introduce CU-ICU, a method for customizing unsupervised instruction-finetuned language models for ICU datasets by leveraging the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) architecture. CU-ICU employs a sparse fine-tuning approach that combines few-shot prompting with selective parameter updates, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal supervision. Our evaluation across critical ICU tasks--early sepsis detection, mortality prediction, and clinical note generation--demonstrates that CU-ICU consistently improves predictive accuracy and interpretability over standard fine-tuning methods. Notably, CU-ICU achieves up to a 15% increase in sepsis detection accuracy and a 20% enhancement in generating clinically relevant explanations while updating fewer than 1% of model parameters in its most efficient configuration. These results establish CU-ICU as a scalable, low-overhead solution for delivering accurate and interpretable clinical decision support in real-world ICU environments.

  _Mohamed Achref Ben Ammar, Mohamed Taha Bennani_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The analysis of conversational dynamics has gained increasing importance with the rise of large language model-based systems, which interact with users across diverse contexts. In this work, we propose a novel computational framework for constructing conversational graphs that capture the flow and structure of loosely organized dialogues, referred to as quasi-patterned conversations. We introduce the Filter & Reconnect method, a novel graph simplification technique that minimizes noise while preserving semantic coherence and structural integrity of conversational graphs. Through comparative analysis, we demonstrate that the use of large language models combined with our graph simplification technique has resulted in semantic metric S increasing by a factor of 2.06 compared to previous approaches while simultaneously enforcing a tree-like structure with 0 {\delta}-hyperbolicity, ensuring optimal clarity in conversation modeling. This work provides a computational method for analyzing large-scale dialogue datasets, with practical applications related to monitoring automated systems such as chatbots, dialogue management tools, and user behavior analytics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There has been extensive research on assessing the value orientation of Large Language Models (LLMs) as it can shape user experiences across demographic groups. However, several challenges remain. First, while the Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) setting has been shown to be vulnerable to perturbations, there is no systematic comparison of probing methods for value probing. Second, it is unclear to what extent the probed values capture in-context information and reflect models' preferences for real-world actions. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness and expressiveness of value representations across three widely used probing strategies. We use variations in prompts and options, showing that all methods exhibit large variances under input perturbations. We also introduce two tasks studying whether the values are responsive to demographic context, and how well they align with the models' behaviors in value-related scenarios. We show that the demographic context has little effect on the free-text generation, and the models' values only weakly correlate with their preference for value-based actions. Our work highlights the need for a more careful examination of LLM value probing and awareness of its limitations.

  The safety of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant research attention. In this paper, we argue that previous empirical studies demonstrate LLMs exhibit a propensity to trust information from authoritative sources, such as academic papers, implying new possible vulnerabilities. To verify this possibility, a preliminary analysis is designed to illustrate our two findings. Based on this insight, a novel jailbreaking method, Paper Summary Attack (\llmname{PSA}), is proposed. It systematically synthesizes content from either attack-focused or defense-focused LLM safety paper to construct an adversarial prompt template, while strategically infilling harmful query as adversarial payloads within predefined subsections. Extensive experiments show significant vulnerabilities not only in base LLMs, but also in state-of-the-art reasoning model like Deepseek-R1. PSA achieves a 97\% attack success rate (ASR) on well-aligned models like Claude3.5-Sonnet and an even higher 98\% ASR on Deepseek-R1. More intriguingly, our work has further revealed diametrically opposed vulnerability bias across different base models, and even between different versions of the same model, when exposed to either attack-focused or defense-focused papers. This phenomenon potentially indicates future research clues for both adversarial methodologies and safetythis http URLis available atthis https URL

  Phishing attacks represent a significant cybersecurity threat, necessitating adaptive detection techniques. This study explores few-shot Adaptive Linguistic Prompting (ALP) in detecting phishing webpages through the multimodal capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. ALP is a structured semantic reasoning method that guides LLMs to analyze textual deception by breaking down linguistic patterns, detecting urgency cues, and identifying manipulative diction commonly found in phishing content. By integrating textual, visual, and URL-based analysis, we propose a unified model capable of identifying sophisticated phishing attempts. Our experiments demonstrate that ALP significantly enhances phishing detection accuracy by guiding LLMs through structured reasoning and contextual analysis. The findings highlight the potential of ALP-integrated multimodal LLMs to advance phishing detection frameworks, achieving an F1-score of 0.93, surpassing traditional approaches. These results establish a foundation for more robust, interpretable, and adaptive linguistic-based phishing detection systems using LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for performing sophisticated software engineering tasks autonomously. In addition, there has been progress towards developing agents that can perform parts of the research pipeline in machine learning and the natural sciences. We argue that research extension and its implementation is a critical capability for such systems, and introduce RExBench to support the evaluation of this capability. RExBench is a benchmark consisting of 12 realistic research experiment implementation tasks that aim to investigate research hypotheses that have not previously been implemented. Each task is set up as an extension to an existing research paper and codebase, accompanied by domain expert-written instructions. RExBench is robust to data contamination, and supports an automatic evaluation infrastructure that executes agent outputs to determine whether the success criteria are met. We use this benchmark to evaluate nine LLM agents implemented using three different frameworks: aider, Claude Code, and OpenHands. We find that all agents evaluated fail to autonomously implement the majority of the extensions. Although the success rate improves with additional human-written hints, the best performance under this setting remains below 40%. This indicates that current agents are still short of being able to handle realistic research extension tasks without substantial human guidance.

  Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in code generation tasks. However, a significant performance disparity persists between popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) and others. To address this capability gap, we leverage the code translation task to train LLMs, thereby facilitating the transfer of coding proficiency across diverse programming languages. Moreover, we introduce OORL for training, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates on-policy and off-policy strategies. Within OORL, on-policy RL is applied during code translation, guided by a rule-based reward signal derived from unit tests. Complementing this coarse-grained rule-based reward, we propose Group Equivalent Preference Optimization (GEPO), a novel preference optimization method. Specifically, GEPO trains the LLM using intermediate representations (IRs) groups. LLMs can be guided to discern IRs equivalent to the source code from inequivalent ones, while also utilizing signals about the mutual equivalence between IRs within the group. This process allows LLMs to capture nuanced aspects of code functionality. By employing OORL for training with code translation tasks, LLMs improve their recognition of code functionality and their understanding of the relationships between code implemented in different languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OORL for LLMs training with code translation tasks achieves significant performance improvements on code benchmarks across multiple programming languages.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scaling the test-time compute of large language models has demonstrated impressive performance on reasoning benchmarks. However, existing evaluations of test-time scaling make the strong assumption that a reasoning system should always give an answer to any question provided. This overlooks concerns about whether a model is confident in its answer, and whether it is appropriate to always provide a response. To address these concerns, we extract confidence scores during reasoning for thresholding model responses. We find that increasing compute budget at inference time not only helps models answer more questions correctly, but also increases confidence in correct responses. We then extend the current paradigm of zero-risk responses during evaluation by considering settings with non-zero levels of response risk, and suggest a recipe for reporting evaluations under these settings.

  Evaluating machine-generated text remains a significant challenge in NLP, especially for non-English languages. Current methodologies, including automated metrics, human assessments, and LLM-based evaluations, predominantly focus on English, revealing a significant gap in multilingual evaluation frameworks. We introduce the Cross Lingual Auto Evaluation (CIA) Suite, an extensible framework that includes evaluator LLMs (Hercule) and a novel test set (Recon) specifically designed for multilingual evaluation. Our test set features 500 human-annotated instructions spanning various task capabilities along with human judgment scores across six languages. This would enable benchmarking of general-purpose multilingual LLMs and facilitate meta-evaluation of Evaluator LLMs. The proposed model, Hercule, is a cross-lingual evaluation model that addresses the scarcity of reference answers in the target language by learning to assign scores to responses based on easily available reference answers in English. Our experiments demonstrate that Hercule aligns more closely with human judgments compared to proprietary models, demonstrating the effectiveness of such cross-lingual evaluation in low resource scenarios. Further, it is also effective in zero-shot evaluation on unseen languages. This study is the first comprehensive examination of cross-lingual evaluation using LLMs, presenting a scalable and effective approach for multilingual assessment. All code, datasets, and models will be publicly available to enable further research in this important area.

  Recent advancements in state-of-the-art (SOTA) Large Language Model (LLM) agents, especially in multi-turn dialogue tasks, have been primarily driven by supervised fine-tuning and high-quality human feedback. However, as base LLM models continue to improve, acquiring meaningful human feedback has become increasingly challenging and costly. In certain domains, base LLM agents may eventually exceed human capabilities, making traditional feedback-driven methods impractical. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-improvement paradigm that empowers LLM agents to autonomously enhance their performance without external human feedback. Our method, Juxtaposed Outcomes for Simulation Harvesting (JOSH), is a self-alignment algorithm that leverages a sparse reward simulation environment to extract ideal behaviors and further train the LLM on its own outputs. We present ToolWOZ, a sparse reward tool-calling simulation environment derived from MultiWOZ. We demonstrate that models trained with JOSH, both small and frontier, significantly improve tool-based interactions while preserving general model capabilities across diverse benchmarks.

  Human motion simulation (HMS) supports cost-effective evaluation of worker behavior, safety, and productivity in industrial tasks. However, existing methods often suffer from low motion fidelity. This study introduces Generative-AI-Enabled HMS (G-AI-HMS), which integrates text-to-text and text-to-motion models to enhance simulation quality for physical tasks. G-AI-HMS tackles two key challenges: (1) translating task descriptions into motion-aware language using Large Language Models aligned with MotionGPT's training vocabulary, and (2) validating AI-enhanced motions against real human movements using computer vision. Posture estimation algorithms are applied to real-time videos to extract joint landmarks, and motion similarity metrics are used to compare them with AI-enhanced sequences. In a case study involving eight tasks, the AI-enhanced motions showed lower error than human created descriptions in most scenarios, performing better in six tasks based on spatial accuracy, four tasks based on alignment after pose normalization, and seven tasks based on overall temporal similarity. Statistical analysis showed that AI-enhanced prompts significantly (p $<$ 0.0001) reduced joint error and temporal misalignment while retaining comparable posture accuracy.

  Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles requires virtual scenario-based testing, which depends on the robust evaluation and generation of safety-critical scenarios. So far, researchers have used scenario-based testing frameworks that rely heavily on handcrafted scenarios as safety metrics. To reduce the effort of human interpretation and overcome the limited scalability of these approaches, we combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured scenario parsing and prompt engineering to automatically evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios. We introduce Cartesian and Ego-centric prompt strategies for scenario evaluation, and an adversarial generation module that modifies trajectories of risk-inducing vehicles (ego-attackers) to create critical scenarios. We validate our approach using a 2D simulation framework and multiple pre-trained LLMs. The results show that the evaluation module effectively detects collision scenarios and infers scenario safety. Meanwhile, the new generation module identifies high-risk agents and synthesizes realistic, safety-critical scenarios. We conclude that an LLM equipped with domain-informed prompting techniques can effectively evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios, reducing dependence on handcrafted metrics. We release our open-source code and scenarios at:this https URL.

  Recent generations of language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers. While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning capabilities.

  Recent advances in mathematical problem-solving with language models (LMs) integrate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and code execution to harness their complementary strengths. However, existing hybrid frameworks exhibit a critical limitation: they depend on externally dictated instructions or rigid code-integration templates, lacking metacognitive awareness -- the capacity to dynamically evaluate intrinsic capabilities and autonomously determine when and how to integrate tools. This rigidity motivates our study of autonomous code integration, enabling models to adapt tool-usage strategies as their reasoning abilities evolve during training.While reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for boosting LLM reasoning at scale (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), we demonstrate its inefficiency in learning autonomous code integration due to inadequate exploration of the vast combinatorial space of CoT-code interleaving patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework that synergizes structured exploration (E-step) with off-policy RL optimization (M-step), creating a self-reinforcing cycle between metacognitive tool-use decisions and evolving capabilities. Experiments reveal our method achieves superior results through improved exploration. Notably, our 7B model improves over 11% on MATH500 and 9.4% on AIME without o1-like CoT.

  Recent advancements in reasoning with large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated their impressive capabilities in complex domains like mathematics and coding. A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "inference-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT. (3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and inference-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks. By providing a structured overview, this survey aims to inspire future research and further the development of logical reasoning in artificial intelligence.

  Ontology Matching (OM) is a cornerstone task of semantic interoperability, yet existing systems often rely on handcrafted rules or specialized models with limited adaptability. We present KROMA, a novel OM framework that harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to dynamically enrich the semantic context of OM tasks with structural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance and efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a lightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and substantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge retrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching, outperforming both classic OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches while keeping communication overhead comparable. Our study highlights the feasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted knowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology matching at scale.

  Innovative idea generation remains a core challenge in AI, as large language models (LLMs) often struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and relevant. Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during training, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt engineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics and structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our framework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains, input formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage prototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary results highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI collaboration.

Many compliance-related queries are multi-hop, requiring synthesis of information across interlinked clauses. This poses a challenge for traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. To overcome this, we introduce BifrostRAG: a dual-graph RAG-integrated system that explicitly models both linguistic relationships (via an Entity Network Graph) and document structure (via a Document Navigator Graph). This architecture powers a hybrid retrieval mechanism that combines graph traversal with vector-based semantic search, enabling large language models to reason over both the meaning and the structure of the text. Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset shows that BifrostRAG achieves 92.8 percent precision, 85.5 percent recall, and an F1 score of 87.3 percent. These results significantly outperform vector-only and graph-only RAG baselines that represent current leading approaches. Error analysis further highlights the comparative advantages of our hybrid method over single-modality RAGs. These findings establish BifrostRAG as a robust knowledge engine for LLM-driven compliance checking. Its dual-graph, hybrid retrieval mechanism offers a transferable blueprint for navigating complex technical documents across knowledge-intensive engineering domains.

  Personalizing AI systems requires understanding not just what users prefer, but the reasons that underlie those preferences - yet current preference models typically treat human judgment as a black box. We introduce PrefPalette, a framework that decomposes preferences into attribute dimensions and tailors its preference prediction to distinct social community values in a human-interpretable manner. PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science principle known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable counterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic training data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality, humor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that learns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes. This approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse evaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social communities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by 46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements, PrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles: scholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented communities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities emphasize empathy. By modeling the attribute-mediated structure of human judgment, PrefPalette delivers both superior preference modeling and transparent, interpretable insights, and serves as a first step toward more trustworthy, value-aware personalized applications.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant promise for intelligent traffic management; however, current chain-based systems like TrafficGPT are hindered by sequential task execution, high token usage, and poor scalability, making them inefficient for complex, real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose GraphTrafficGPT, a novel graph-based architecture, which fundamentally redesigns the task coordination process for LLM-driven traffic applications. GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies as nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution and dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a Brain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency graphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for data retrieval, analysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware token management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed architecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTrafficGPT reduces token consumption by 50.2% and average response latency by 19.0% compared to TrafficGPT, while supporting simultaneous multi-query execution with up to 23.0% improvement in efficiency.

  Traditional agent-based urban mobility simulations often rely on rigid rule-based systems that struggle to capture the complexity, adaptability, and behavioral diversity inherent in human travel decision making. Recent advancements in large language models and AI agent technologies present new opportunities to develop agents with enhanced reasoning capabilities, persistent memory, and adaptive learning. We introduce GATSim (Generative-Agent Transport Simulation), a novel framework that leverages these advancements to simulate urban mobility using generative agents with rich, human-like behaviors. Unlike conventional approaches, GATSim agents are characterized by diverse socioeconomic profiles, individual lifestyles, and evolving preferences shaped through psychologically informed memory systems, tool usage, and lifelong learning. The main contributions of this work are: (1) a comprehensive architecture that integrates an urban mobility foundation model with agent cognitive systems and a transport simulation environment; (2) a hierarchical memory designed for efficient retrieval of contextually relevant information, incorporating spatial and temporal associations, keyword matching, and semantic relevance; (3) innovative planning and reactive mechanisms for modeling adaptive mobility behaviors which integrate a multi-scale reflection process to transform specific travel experiences into generalized behavioral insights. We implement a prototype system and conduct systematic validation, demonstrating that generative agents produce believable and coherent travel behaviors. Experimental results indicate that generative agents perform at least as well as human annotators with 92\% posterior probability, while naturally producing realistic macroscopic traffic patterns. The code for the prototype implementation is publicly available atthis https URL.

  Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-world applications such as "digital assistants, autonomous customer service, and decision-support systems", where their ability to "interact in multi-turn, tool-augmented environments" makes them indispensable. However, ensuring the safety of these agents remains a significant challenge due to the diverse and complex risks arising from dynamic user interactions, external tool usage, and the potential for unintended harmful behaviors. To address this critical issue, we propose AutoSafe, the first framework that systematically enhances agent safety through fully automated synthetic data generation. Concretely, 1) we introduce an open and extensible threat model, OTS, which formalizes how unsafe behaviors emerge from the interplay of user instructions, interaction contexts, and agent actions. This enables precise modeling of safety risks across diverse scenarios. 2) we develop a fully automated data generation pipeline that simulates unsafe user behaviors, applies self-reflective reasoning to generate safe responses, and constructs a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality safety training dataset-eliminating the need for hazardous real-world data collection. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we design comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world safety benchmarks. Results demonstrate that AutoSafe boosts safety scores by 45% on average and achieves a 28.91% improvement on real-world tasks, validating the generalization ability of our learned safety strategies. These results highlight the practical advancement and scalability of AutoSafe in building safer LLM-based agents for real-world deployment. We have released the project page atthis https URL.
