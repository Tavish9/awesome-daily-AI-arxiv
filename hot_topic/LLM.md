- **[From Strangers to Assistants: Fast Desire Alignment for Embodied Agent-User Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22503)**  `arXiv:2505.22503`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.MA`

  While embodied agents have made significant progress in performing complex physical tasks, real-world applications demand more than pure task execution. The agents must collaborate with unfamiliar agents and human users, whose goals are often vague and implicit. In such settings, interpreting ambiguous instructions and uncovering underlying desires is essential for effective assistance. Therefore, fast and accurate desire alignment becomes a critical capability for embodied agents. In this work, we first develop a home assistance simulation environment HA-Desire that integrates an LLM-driven human user agent exhibiting realistic value-driven goal selection and communication. The ego agent must interact with this proxy user to infer and adapt to the user's latent desires. To achieve this, we present a novel framework FAMER for fast desire alignment, which introduces a desire-based mental reasoning mechanism to identify user intent and filter desire-irrelevant actions. We further design a reflection-based communication module that reduces redundant inquiries, and incorporate goal-relevant information extraction with memory persistence to improve information reuse and reduce unnecessary exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances both task execution and communication efficiency, enabling embodied agents to quickly adapt to user-specific desires in complex embodied environments.

  We introduce Behavior from Language and Demonstration (BLADE), a framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation by integrating imitation learning and model-based planning. BLADE leverages language-annotated demonstrations, extracts abstract action knowledge from large language models (LLMs), and constructs a library of structured, high-level action representations. These representations include preconditions and effects grounded in visual perception for each high-level action, along with corresponding controllers implemented as neural network-based policies. BLADE can recover such structured representations automatically, without manually labeled states or symbolic definitions. BLADE shows significant capabilities in generalizing to novel situations, including novel initial states, external state perturbations, and novel goals. We validate the effectiveness of our approach both in simulation and on real robots with a diverse set of objects with articulated parts, partial observability, and geometric constraints.

  Object search in large-scale, unstructured environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, particularly in dynamic or expansive settings such as outdoor autonomous exploration. This task requires robust spatial reasoning and the ability to leverage prior experiences. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong semantic capabilities, their application in embodied contexts is limited by a grounding gap in spatial reasoning and insufficient mechanisms for memory integration and decisionthis http URLaddress these challenges, we propose GET (Goal-directed Exploration and Targeting), a framework that enhances object search by combining LLM-based reasoning with experience-guided exploration. At its core is DoUT (Diagram of Unified Thought), a reasoning module that facilitates real-time decision-making through a role-based feedback loop, integrating task-specific criteria and external memory. For repeated tasks, GET maintains a probabilistic task map based on a Gaussian Mixture Model, allowing for continual updates to object-location priors as environmentsthis http URLconducted in real-world, large-scale environments demonstrate that GET improves search efficiency and robustness across multiple LLMs and task settings, significantly outperforming heuristic and LLM-only baselines. These results suggest that structured LLM integration provides a scalable and generalizable approach to embodied decision-making in complex environments.

- **[Benchmarking LLMs' Swarm intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04364)**  `arXiv:2505.04364`  `cs.MA` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict swarm-like constraints-limited local perception and communication-remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks (Pursuit, Synchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input ($k\times k$ view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Zero-shot evaluations of leading LLMs (e.g., deepseek-v3, o4-mini) reveal significant task-dependent performance variations. While some rudimentary coordination is observed, our results indicate that current LLMs significantly struggle with robust long-range planning and adaptive strategy formation under the uncertainty inherent in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under such swarm-like constraints is crucial for understanding their utility in future decentralized intelligent systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built on a customizable physical system-providing environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive datasets. This aims to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of emergent collective behavior under severe informational decentralization. Our code repository is available atthis https URL.

- **[Topological Structure Learning Should Be A Research Priority for LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22467)**  `arXiv:2505.22467`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex tasks through collaborative intelligence. Nevertheless, the question of how agents should be structurally organized for optimal cooperation remains largely unexplored. In this position paper, we aim to gently redirect the focus of the MAS research community toward this critical dimension: develop topology-aware MASs for specific tasks. Specifically, the system consists of three core components - agents, communication links, and communication patterns - that collectively shape its coordination performance and efficiency. To this end, we introduce a systematic, three-stage framework: agent selection, structure profiling, and topology synthesis. Each stage would trigger new research opportunities in areas such as language models, reinforcement learning, graph learning, and generative modeling; together, they could unleash the full potential of MASs in complicated real-world applications. Then, we discuss the potential challenges and opportunities in the evaluation of multiple systems. We hope our perspective and framework can offer critical new insights in the era of agentic AI.

- **[Herd Behavior: Investigating Peer Influence in LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21588)**  `arXiv:2505.21588`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of multi-agent systems where LLMs interact, collaborate, and make decisions in shared environments. While individual model behavior has been extensively studied, the dynamics of peer influence in such systems remain underexplored. In this paper, we investigate herd behavior, the tendency of agents to align their outputs with those of their peers, within LLM-based multi-agent interactions. We present a series of controlled experiments that reveal how herd behaviors are shaped by multiple factors. First, we show that the gap between self-confidence and perceived confidence in peers significantly impacts an agent's likelihood to conform. Second, we find that the format in which peer information is presented plays a critical role in modulating the strength of herd behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of herd behavior can be systematically controlled, and that appropriately calibrated herd tendencies can enhance collaborative outcomes. These findings offer new insights into the social dynamics of LLM-based systems and open pathways for designing more effective and adaptive multi-agent collaboration frameworks.

- **[Efficient Leave-one-out Approximation in LLM Multi-agent Debate Based on Introspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22192)**  `arXiv:2505.22192`  `cs.MA`  
  _Yue Cui, Liuyi Yao, Zitao Li, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding, Xiaofang Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) advance automatic task completion in various fields, where debate is a common cooperation form for agents to solve complicated problems with reasoning and cross-review to solidify answers. Assessing the individual contributions of agents within these debates is crucial for system refinement and outcome reliability. Traditional leave-one-out (LOO) method offers a clear framework for evaluating each agent's role but face challenges in LLM-based systems due to high computational costs and associated financial implications. This paper presents introspective-leave-one-out (IntrospecLOO), a simple yet effective prompting for approximation of LOO in LLM-powered multi-agent debates. IntrospecLOO introduces an additional querying round after standard debates, prompting agents to update their answers while ignoring responses from a designated agent. This strategy effectively isolates and gauges each participant's influence at a reduced query complexity compared to the original LOO approaches. Validation through experiments on three benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of IntrospecLOO.

  Scaling Transformer to a large scale without using some technical tricks such as learning rate warump and using an obviously lower learning rate is an extremely challenging task, and is increasingly gaining more attention. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis for the process of training Transformer and reveal the rationale behind the model crash phenomenon in the training process, termed \textit{spectral energy concentration} of ${\bW_q}^{\top} \bW_k$, which is the reason for a malignant entropy collapse, where ${\bW_q}$ and $\bW_k$ are the projection matrices for the query and the key in Transformer, respectively. To remedy this problem, motivated by \textit{Weyl's Inequality}, we present a novel optimization strategy, \ie, making the weight updating in successive steps smooth -- if the ratio $\frac{\sigma_{1}(\nabla \bW_t)}{\sigma_{1}(\bW_{t-1})}$ is larger than a threshold, we will automatically bound the learning rate to a weighted multiple of $\frac{\sigma_{1}(\bW_{t-1})}{\sigma_{1}(\nabla \bW_t)}$, where $\nabla \bW_t$ is the updating quantity in step $t$. Such an optimization strategy can prevent spectral energy concentration to only a few directions, and thus can avoid malignant entropy collapse which will trigger the model crash. We conduct extensive experiments using ViT, Swin-Transformer and GPT, showing that our optimization strategy can effectively and stably train these Transformers without using learning rate warmup.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly approaching and potentially surpassing human-level performance, it has become imperative to develop approaches capable of effectively supervising and enhancing these powerful models using smaller, human-level models exposed to only human-level data. We address this critical weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization challenge by proposing a novel method aimed at improving weak experts, by training on the same limited human-level data, enabling them to generalize to complex, super-human-level tasks. Our approach, called \textbf{EnsemW2S}, employs a token-level ensemble strategy that iteratively combines multiple weak experts, systematically addressing the shortcomings identified in preceding iterations. By continuously refining these weak models, we significantly enhance their collective ability to supervise stronger student models. We extensively evaluate the generalization performance of both the ensemble of weak experts and the subsequent strong student model across in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. For OOD, we specifically introduce question difficulty as an additional dimension for defining distributional shifts. Our empirical results demonstrate notable improvements, achieving 4\%, and 3.2\% improvements on ID datasets and, upto 6\% and 2.28\% on OOD datasets for experts and student models respectively, underscoring the effectiveness of our proposed method in advancing W2S generalization.

- **[Efficient Ensemble for Fine-tuning Language Models on Multiple Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21930)**  `arXiv:2505.21930`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Dongyue Li, Ziniu Zhang, Lu Wang, Hongyang R. Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper develops an ensemble method for fine-tuning a language model to multiple datasets. Existing methods, such as quantized LoRA (QLoRA), are efficient when adapting to a single dataset. When training on multiple datasets of different tasks, a common setup in practice, it remains unclear how to design an efficient adaptation for fine-tuning language models. We propose to use an ensemble of multiple smaller adapters instead of a single adapter per task. We design an efficient algorithm that partitions $n$ datasets into $m$ groups, where $m$ is typically much smaller than $n$ in practice, and train one adapter for each group before taking a weighted combination to form the ensemble. The algorithm leverages a first-order approximation property of low-rank adaptation to quickly obtain the fine-tuning performances of dataset combinations since methods like LoRA stay close to the base model. Hence, we use the gradients of the base model to estimate its behavior during fine-tuning. Empirically, this approximation holds with less than $1\%$ error on models with up to $34$ billion parameters, leading to an estimation of true fine-tuning performances under $5\%$ error while speeding up computation compared to base fine-tuning by $105$ times. When applied to fine-tune Llama and GPT models on ten text classification tasks, our approach provides up to $10\%$ higher average test accuracy over QLoRA, with only $9\%$ more FLOPs. On a Llama model with $34$ billion parameters, an ensemble of QLoRA increases test accuracy by $3\%$ compared to QLoRA, with only $8\%$ more FLOPs.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong conversational abilities but often generate falsehoods. Prior work suggests that the truthfulness of simple propositions can be represented as a single linear direction in a model's internal activations, but this may not fully capture its underlying geometry. In this work, we extend the concept cone framework, recently introduced for modeling refusal, to the domain of truth. We identify multi-dimensional cones that causally mediate truth-related behavior across multiple LLM families. Our results are supported by three lines of evidence: (i) causal interventions reliably flip model responses to factual statements, (ii) learned cones generalize across model architectures, and (iii) cone-based interventions preserve unrelated model behavior. These findings reveal the richer, multidirectional structure governing simple true/false propositions in LLMs and highlight concept cones as a promising tool for probing abstract behaviors.

  Transformers have theoretical limitations in modeling certain sequence-to-sequence tasks, yet it remains largely unclear if these limitations play a role in large-scale pretrained LLMs, or whether LLMs might effectively overcome these constraints in practice due to the scale of both the models themselves and their pretraining data. We explore how these architectural constraints manifest after pretraining, by studying a family of $\textit{retrieval}$ and $\textit{copying}$ tasks inspired by Liu et al. [2024]. We use the recently proposed C-RASP framework for studying length generalization [Huang et al., 2025b] to provide guarantees for each of our settings. Empirically, we observe an $\textit{induction-versus-anti-induction}$ asymmetry, where pretrained models are better at retrieving tokens to the right (induction) rather than the left (anti-induction) of a query token. This asymmetry disappears upon targeted fine-tuning if length-generalization is guaranteed by theory. Mechanistic analysis reveals that this asymmetry is connected to the differences in the strength of induction versus anti-induction circuits within pretrained Transformers. We validate our findings through practical experiments on real-world tasks demonstrating reliability risks. Our results highlight that pretraining selectively enhances certain Transformer capabilities, but does not overcome fundamental length-generalization limits.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has played a central role in the recent surge of LLMs' math abilities by enabling self-improvement through binary verifier signals. In contrast, Supervised Learning (SL) is rarely considered for such verification-driven training, largely due to its heavy reliance on reference answers and inability to reflect on mistakes. In this work, we challenge the prevailing notion that self-improvement is exclusive to RL and propose Negative-aware Fine-Tuning (NFT) -- a supervised approach that enables LLMs to reflect on their failures and improve autonomously with no external teachers. In online training, instead of throwing away self-generated negative answers, NFT constructs an implicit negative policy to model them. This implicit policy is parameterized with the same positive LLM we target to optimize on positive data, enabling direct policy optimization on all LLMs' generations. We conduct experiments on 7B and 32B models in math reasoning tasks. Results consistently show that through the additional leverage of negative feedback, NFT significantly improves over SL baselines like Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning, matching or even surpassing leading RL algorithms like GRPO and DAPO. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NFT and GRPO are actually equivalent in strict-on-policy training, even though they originate from entirely different theoretical foundations. Our experiments and theoretical findings bridge the gap between SL and RL methods in binary-feedback learning systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a critical yet challenging aspect of machine learning model development, significantly impacting model performance and generalization. Traditional HPO methods often struggle with high dimensionality, complex interdependencies, and computational expense. This paper introduces OptiMindTune, a novel multi-agent framework designed to intelligently and efficiently optimize hyperparameters. OptiMindTune leverages the collaborative intelligence of three specialized AI agents -- a Recommender Agent, an Evaluator Agent, and a Decision Agent -- each powered by Google's Gemini models. These agents address distinct facets of the HPO problem, from model selection and hyperparameter suggestion to robust evaluation and strategic decision-making. By fostering dynamic interactions and knowledge sharing, OptiMindTune aims to converge to optimal hyperparameter configurations more rapidly and robustly than existing single-agent or monolithic approaches. Our framework integrates principles from advanced large language models, and adaptive search to achieve scalable and intelligent AutoML. We posit that this multi-agent paradigm offers a promising avenue for tackling the increasing complexity of modern machine learning model tuning.

  Recent unlearning methods for LLMs are vulnerable to relearning attacks: knowledge believed-to-be-unlearned re-emerges by fine-tuning on a small set of (even seemingly-unrelated) examples. We study this phenomenon in a controlled setting for example-level unlearning in vision classifiers. We make the surprising discovery that forget-set accuracy can recover from around 50% post-unlearning to nearly 100% with fine-tuning on just the retain set -- i.e., zero examples of the forget set. We observe this effect across a wide variety of unlearning methods, whereas for a model retrained from scratch excluding the forget set (gold standard), the accuracy remains at 50%. We observe that resistance to relearning attacks can be predicted by weight-space properties, specifically, $L_2$-distance and linear mode connectivity between the original and the unlearned model. Leveraging this insight, we propose a new class of methods that achieve state-of-the-art resistance to relearning attacks.

  Large-language models (LLMs) and chatbot agents are known to provide wrong outputs at times, and it was recently found that this can never be fully prevented. Hence, uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role, aiming to quantify the level of ambiguity in either one overall number or two numbers for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. This position paper argues that this traditional dichotomy of uncertainties is too limited for the open and interactive setup that LLM agents operate in when communicating with a user, and that we need to research avenues that enrich uncertainties in this novel scenario. We review the literature and find that popular definitions of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties directly contradict each other and lose their meaning in interactive LLM agent settings. Hence, we propose three novel research directions that focus on uncertainties in such human-computer interactions: Underspecification uncertainties, for when users do not provide all information or define the exact task at the first go, interactive learning, to ask follow-up questions and reduce the uncertainty about the current context, and output uncertainties, to utilize the rich language and speech space to express uncertainties as more than mere numbers. We expect that these new ways of dealing with and communicating uncertainties will lead to LLM agent interactions that are more transparent, trustworthy, and intuitive.

  This paper aims to overcome a major obstacle in scaling RL for reasoning with LLMs, namely the collapse of policy entropy. Such phenomenon is consistently observed across vast RL runs without entropy intervention, where the policy entropy dropped sharply at the early training stage, this diminished exploratory ability is always accompanied with the saturation of policy performance. In practice, we establish a transformation equation R=-a*e^H+b between entropy H and downstream performance R. This empirical law strongly indicates that, the policy performance is traded from policy entropy, thus bottlenecked by its exhaustion, and the ceiling is fully predictable H=0, R=-a+b. Our finding necessitates entropy management for continuous exploration toward scaling compute for RL. To this end, we investigate entropy dynamics both theoretically and empirically. Our derivation highlights that, the change in policy entropy is driven by the covariance between action probability and the change in logits, which is proportional to its advantage when using Policy Gradient-like algorithms. Empirical study shows that, the values of covariance term and entropy differences matched exactly, supporting the theoretical conclusion. Moreover, the covariance term stays mostly positive throughout training, further explaining why policy entropy would decrease monotonically. Through understanding the mechanism behind entropy dynamics, we motivate to control entropy by restricting the update of high-covariance tokens. Specifically, we propose two simple yet effective techniques, namely Clip-Cov and KL-Cov, which clip and apply KL penalty to tokens with high covariances respectively. Experiments show that these methods encourage exploration, thus helping policy escape entropy collapse and achieve better downstream performance.

  Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advances in complex reasoning tasks, yet they remain bottlenecked by two core challenges: architectural inefficiency due to reliance on Transformers, and a lack of structured fine-tuning for high-difficulty domains. We introduce \ourmodel, an attention-free language model that addresses both issues through architectural and data-centric innovations. Built on the state space dual (SSD) layers of Mamba-2, our model eliminates the need for self-attention and key-value caching, enabling fixed-memory, constant-time inference. To train it for complex reasoning, we propose a two-phase curriculum fine-tuning strategy based on the \textsc{PromptCoT} synthesis paradigm, which generates pedagogically structured problems via abstract concept selection and rationale-guided generation. On benchmark evaluations, \ourmodel-7B outperforms strong Transformer and hybrid models of comparable scale, and even surpasses the much larger Gemma3-27B by 2.6\% on AIME 24, 0.6\% on AIME 25, and 3.0\% on Livecodebench. These results highlight the potential of state space models as efficient and scalable alternatives to attention-based architectures for high-capacity reasoning.

  The success of DeepSeek-R1 underscores the significant role of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we present Skywork-OR1, an effective and scalable RL implementation for long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models. Building on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill model series, our RL approach achieves notable performance gains, increasing average accuracy across AIME24, AIME25, and LiveCodeBench from 57.8% to 72.8% (+15.0%) for the 32B model and from 43.6% to 57.5% (+13.9%) for the 7B model. Our Skywork-OR1-32B model surpasses both DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-32B on the AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks, while achieving comparable results on LiveCodeBench. The Skywork-OR1-7B and Skywork-OR1-Math-7B models demonstrate competitive reasoning capabilities among models of similar size. We perform comprehensive ablation studies on the core components of our training pipeline to validate their effectiveness. Additionally, we thoroughly investigate the phenomenon of entropy collapse, identify key factors affecting entropy dynamics, and demonstrate that mitigating premature entropy collapse is critical for improved test performance. To support community research, we fully open-source our model weights, training code, and training datasets.

  Inference-time computation has emerged as a promising scaling axis for improving large language model reasoning. However, despite yielding impressive performance, the optimal allocation of inference-time computation remains poorly understood. A central question is whether to prioritize sequential scaling (e.g., longer chains of thought) or parallel scaling (e.g., majority voting across multiple short chains of thought). In this work, we seek to illuminate the landscape of test-time scaling by demonstrating the existence of reasoning settings where sequential scaling offers an exponential advantage over parallel scaling. These settings are based on graph connectivity problems in challenging distributions of graphs. We validate our theoretical findings with comprehensive experiments across a range of language models, including models trained from scratch for graph connectivity with different chain of thought strategies as well as large reasoning models.

  Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated the ability to improve performance in chemistry-related tasks by selecting appropriate tools. However, their effectiveness remains limited by the inherent prediction errors of chemistry tools. In this paper, we take a step further by exploring how LLMbased agents can, in turn, be leveraged to reduce prediction errors of the tools. To this end, we propose ChemHAS (Chemical Hierarchical Agent Stacking), a simple yet effective method that enhances chemistry tools through optimizing agent-stacking structures from limited data. ChemHAS achieves state-of-the-art performance across four fundamental chemistry tasks, demonstrating that our method can effectively compensate for prediction errors of the tools. Furthermore, we identify and characterize four distinct agent-stacking behaviors, potentially improving interpretability and revealing new possibilities for AI agent applications in scientific research.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) pruning seeks to remove unimportant weights for inference speedup with minimal accuracy impact. However, existing methods often suffer from accuracy degradation without full-model sparsity-aware fine-tuning. This paper presents Wanda++, a novel pruning framework that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by utilizing decoder-block-level \textbf{regional} gradients. Specifically, Wanda++ improves the pruning score with regional gradients for the first time and proposes an efficient regional optimization method to minimize pruning-induced output discrepancies between the dense and sparse decoder output. Notably, Wanda++ improves perplexity by up to 32\% over Wanda in the language modeling task and generalizes effectively to downstream tasks. Moreover, despite updating weights with regional optimization, Wanda++ remains orthogonal to sparsity-aware fine-tuning, further reducing perplexity with LoRA in great extend. Our approach is lightweight, pruning a 7B LLaMA model in under 10 minutes on a single H100 GPU.

  Discrete diffusion models offer a flexible, controllable approach to structured sequence generation, yet they still lag behind causal language models in expressive power. A key limitation lies in their reliance on the Markovian assumption, which restricts each step to condition only on the current state, leading to potential uncorrectable error accumulation. In this paper, we introduce CaDDi, a discrete diffusion model that conditions on the entire generative trajectory, thereby lifting the Markov constraint and allowing the model to revisit and improve past states. By unifying sequential (causal) and temporal (diffusion) reasoning in a single non-Markovian transformer, CaDDi also treats standard causal language models as a special case and permits the direct reuse of pretrained LLM weights with no architectural changes. Empirically, CaDDi outperforms state-of-the-art discrete diffusion baselines on natural-language benchmarks, substantially narrowing the remaining gap to large autoregressive transformers.

  Artificial intelligence progresses towards the "Era of Experience," where agents are expected to learn from continuous, grounded interaction. We argue that traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL), which typically represents value as a scalar, can restrict agent's deep understanding of environments and hinders the active, deliberative learning crucial for navigating this new paradigm. To address the issue, we introduce Natural Language Reinforcement Learning (NLRL), a framework that extends RL principles into natural language counterparts. Central to NLRL is the Language Value Function (LVF), which redefines value as an interpretable linguistic narrative articulating the rationale behind an evaluation. NLRL further extends this concept to core RL components, including policy, the Bellman equation, and policy iteration. Leveraging recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), NLRL can be practically implemented to achieve RL-like policy and value training through unsupervised environment interactions. Experiments over 4 multi-step agentic tasks demonstrate NLRL's effectiveness, efficiency, and its potential to foster deeper understanding and more active learning strategies.

  Transformers have become the backbone of modern Large Language Models (LLMs); however, their inference overhead grows linearly with the sequence length, posing challenges for modeling long sequences. In light of this, Mamba has attracted attention for maintaining a constant inference size, with empirical evidence demonstrating that it can match Transformer performance in sequence modeling while significantly reducing computational costs. However, an open question remains: can Mamba always bring savings while achieving performance comparable to Transformers? In this paper, we focus on analyzing the expressive ability of Mamba to perform our defined COPY operation and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. First, inspired by the connection between Mamba and linear attention, we show that constant-sized Mamba may struggle to perform COPY operations while Transformers can handle them more easily. However, when the size of Mamba grows linearly with the input sequence length, it can accurately perform COPY, but in this case, Mamba no longer provides overhead savings. Based on this observation, we further analyze Mamba's ability to tackle CoT tasks, which can be described by the Dynamic Programming (DP) problems. Our findings suggest that to solve arbitrary DP problems, the total cost of Mamba is still comparable to standard Transformers. However, similar to efficient Transformers, when facing DP problems with favorable properties such as locality, Mamba can provide savings in overhead. Our experiments on the copy and CoT tasks further demonstrate Mamba's limitations compared to Transformers in learning these tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training with larger mini-batches improves the convergence rate and can yield superior performance. However, training with large mini-batches becomes prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs), due to the large GPU memory requirement. To address this problem, an effective approach is finding small mini-batch coresets that closely match the gradient of larger mini-batches. However, this approach becomes infeasible and ineffective for LLMs, due to the highly imbalanced mixture of sources in language data, use of the Adam optimizer, and the very large gradient dimensionality of LLMs. In this work, we address the above challenges by proposing Coresets for Training LLMs (CoLM). First, we show that mini-batch coresets found by gradient matching do not contain representative examples of the small sources w.h.p., and thus including all examples of the small sources in the mini-batch coresets is crucial for optimal performance. Second, we normalize the gradients by their historical exponential to find mini-batch coresets for training with Adam. Finally, we leverage zeroth-order methods to find smooth gradient of the last V-projection matrix and sparsify it to keep the dimensions with the largest normalized gradient magnitude. We apply CoLM to fine-tuning Phi-2, Phi-3, Zephyr, and Llama-3 models with LoRA on MathInstruct and SuperGLUE benchmark. Remarkably, CoLM reduces the memory requirement of fine-tuning by 2x and even outperforms training with 4x larger mini-batches. Moreover, CoLM seamlessly integrates with existing memory-efficient training methods like LoRA, further reducing the memory requirements of training LLMs. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  _Zhiyi Wan, Wanrou Du, Liang Li, Miao Pan, Xiaoqi Qin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) scenarios, where performance on previously learned tasks degrades severely while training on sequentially arriving tasks. Although pioneering CL approaches using orthogonal subspaces can mitigate task interference, they typically employ fixed budget allocation, neglecting the varying complexity across tasks and layers. Besides, recent budget-adaptive tuning methods for LLMs often adopt multi-stage paradigms that decouple optimization and budget allocation. Such decoupling results in potential misalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel parameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies dynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in a single end-to-end training stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic bottleneck dimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an efficient parameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment. To effectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with the dynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically between the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically allocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency, achieving higher average accuracy while using 58.5% fewer parameters on the standard CL benchmark.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The order of training samples plays a crucial role in large language models (LLMs), significantly impacting both their external performance and internal learning dynamics. Traditional methods for investigating this effect generally require retraining the model with various sample orders, which is computationally infeasible for LLMs. In this work, we improve traditional methods by designing a retraining-free framework. By approximating Adam optimizer updates with first- and second-order Taylor expansions and utilizing random projection methods to store intermediate checkpoints, our framework can efficiently estimate model parameters for arbitrary training sample orders. Next, we apply our framework to two downstream research problems: (1) Training curriculum design for LLMs -- we base our retraining-free framework to propose a novel curriculum learning strategy that augments curriculum proposals with estimated model performances, enabling more informed sample scheduling. (2) LLMs' memorization and generalization effect analysis -- we use our retraining-free framework to estimate how the positions of training samples influence LLMs' capacity for memorization and generalization. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our retraining-free framework in reproducing the true model performances, and further demonstrate its potential in optimizing LLM training curricula and analyzing the memorization and generalization effects of LLMs.

  Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) codes are essential for hospital reimbursement and operations but require labor-intensive assignment. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with DRG coding due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) nature of the task: pretraining corpora rarely contain private clinical or billing data. We introduce DRG-Sapphire, which uses large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for automated DRG coding from clinical notes. Built on Qwen2.5-7B and trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using rule-based rewards, DRG-Sapphire introduces a series of RL enhancements to address domain-specific challenges not seen in previous mathematical tasks. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MIMIC-IV benchmark and generates physician-validated reasoning for DRG assignments, significantly enhancing explainability. Our study further sheds light on broader challenges of applying RL to knowledge-intensive, OOD tasks. We observe that RL performance scales approximately linearly with the logarithm of the number of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) examples, suggesting that RL effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the domain knowledge encoded in the base model. For OOD tasks like DRG coding, strong RL performance requires sufficient knowledge infusion prior to RL. Consequently, scaling SFT may be more effective and computationally efficient than scaling RL alone for such tasks.

  Real-world processes often generate data that are a mix of categorical and numeric values that are recorded at irregular and informative intervals. Discrete token-based approaches are limited in numeric representation capacity while methods like neural ordinary differential equations are not well suited for categorical data or informative sampling and require augmentation to handle certain classes of trajectories. Here, we present multivariateGPT, a single architecture for modeling sequences of mixed categorical (including tokenized text) and numeric data. This is accomplished with an autoregressive sequence decomposition, embedding scheme, and loss function that extend the next token prediction task to likelihood estimation of the joint distribution of next token class and value. We demonstrate how this approach can efficiently learn to generalize patterns in simple physical systems and model complex time series including electrocardiograms and multivariate electronic health record data. This work extends the utility of transformer based models to additional classes of data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model quantization reduces the bit-width of weights and activations, improving memory efficiency and inference speed in diffusion models. However, achieving 4-bit quantization remains challenging. Existing methods, primarily based on integer quantization and post-training quantization fine-tuning, struggle with inconsistent performance. Inspired by the success of floating-point (FP) quantization in large language models, we explore low-bit FP quantization for diffusion models and identify key challenges: the failure of signed FP quantization to handle asymmetric activation distributions, the insufficient consideration of temporal complexity in the denoising process during fine-tuning, and the misalignment between fine-tuning loss and quantization error. To address these challenges, we propose the mixup-sign floating-point quantization (MSFP) framework, first introducing unsigned FP quantization in model quantization, along with timestep-aware LoRA (TALoRA) and denoising-factor loss alignment (DFA), which ensure precise and stable fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that we are the first to achieve superior performance in 4-bit FP quantization for diffusion models, outperforming existing PTQ fine-tuning methods in 4-bit INT quantization.

  Agricultural decision-making involves complex, context-specific reasoning, where choices about crops, practices, and interventions depend heavily on geographic, climatic, and economic conditions. Traditional large language models (LLMs) often fall short in navigating this nuanced problem due to limited reasoning capacity. We hypothesize that recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) can better handle such structured, domain-specific inference. To investigate this, we introduce AgReason, the first expert-curated open-ended science benchmark with 100 questions for agricultural reasoning. Evaluations across thirteen open-source and proprietary models reveal that LRMs outperform conventional ones, though notable challenges persist, with the strongest Gemini-based baseline achieving 36% accuracy. We also present AgThoughts, a large-scale dataset of 44.6K question-answer pairs generated with human oversight and equipped with synthetically generated reasoning traces. Using AgThoughts, we develop AgThinker, a suite of small reasoning models that can be run on consumer-grade GPUs, and show that our dataset can be effective in unlocking agricultural reasoning abilities in LLMs. Our project page is here:this https URL

  Reinforcement Learning Finetuning (RFT) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling long chains of thought, self-correction, and effective tool use. While recent works attempt to extend RFT to vision-language models (VLMs), these efforts largely produce text-only reasoning conditioned on static image inputs, falling short of true multimodal reasoning in the response. In contrast, test-time methods like Visual Sketchpad incorporate visual steps but lack training mechanisms.We introduce VTool-R1, the first framework that trains VLMs to generate multimodal chains of thought by interleaving text and intermediate visual reasoning steps. VTool-R1 integrates Python-based visual editing tools into the RFT process, enabling VLMs to learn when and how to generate visual reasoning steps that benefit final reasoning. Trained with outcome-based rewards tied to task accuracy, our approach elicits strategic visual tool use for reasoning without relying on process-based supervision. Experiments on structured visual question answering over charts and tables show that VTool-R1 enhances reasoning performance by teaching VLMs to "think with images" and generate multimodal chain of thoughts with tools.

  Loss reweighting has shown significant benefits for machine unlearning with large language models (LLMs). However, their exact functionalities are left unclear and the optimal strategy remains an open question, thus impeding the understanding and improvement of existing methodologies. In this paper, we identify two distinct goals of loss reweighting, namely, Saturation and Importance -- the former indicates that those insufficiently optimized data should be emphasized, while the latter stresses some critical data that are most influential for loss minimization. To study their usefulness, we design specific reweighting strategies for each goal and evaluate their respective effects on unlearning. We conduct extensive empirical analyses on well-established benchmarks, and summarize some important observations as follows: (i) Saturation enhances efficacy more than importance-based reweighting, and their combination can yield additional improvements. (ii) Saturation typically allocates lower weights to data with lower likelihoods, whereas importance-based reweighting does the opposite. (iii) The efficacy of unlearning is also largely influenced by the smoothness and granularity of the weight distributions. Based on these findings, we propose SatImp, a simple reweighting method that combines the advantages of both saturation and importance. Empirical results on extensive datasets validate the efficacy of our method, potentially bridging existing research gaps and indicating directions for future research.

  Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers detailed insights into cellular heterogeneity. Recent advancements leverage single-cell large language models (scLLMs) for effective representation learning. These models focus exclusively on transcriptomic data, neglecting complementary biological knowledge from textual descriptions. To overcome this limitation, we propose scMMGPT, a novel multimodal framework designed for language-enhanced representation learning in single-cell transcriptomics. Unlike existing methods, scMMGPT employs robust cell representation extraction, preserving quantitative gene expression data, and introduces an innovative two-stage pre-training strategy combining discriminative precision with generative flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that scMMGPT significantly outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines across key downstream tasks, including cell annotation and clustering, and exhibits superior generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) have recently become prevalent for time series forecasting tasks. While fine-tuning LLMs enables domain adaptation, they often struggle to generalize across diverse and unseen datasets. Moreover, existing Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) still face challenges in handling non-stationary dynamics and distribution shifts, largely due to the lack of effective mechanisms for adaptation. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for time series forecasting that enhances the generalization and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant segments from a dedicated knowledge base, enriching the contextual representation of the input query. Furthermore, we propose an Adaptive Retrieval Mixer (ARM) module that dynamically fuses the retrieved patterns with the TSFM's internal representation, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming the existing TSFMs by up to 6.84% across diverse domains while also providing desirable interpretability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models advance toward superhuman performance, ensuring their alignment with human values and abilities grows increasingly complex. Weak-to-strong generalization offers a promising approach by leveraging predictions from weaker models to guide stronger systems, but its effectiveness could be constrained by the inherent noise and inaccuracies in these weak predictions. To address this, we propose a theoretically grounded approach that replaces forward KL divergence-whose mass-covering behavior risks overfitting to imperfect weak signals-with reverse KL divergence. Reverse KL divergence's zero-forcing effect prioritizes high-confidence predictions, effectively mitigating the influence of unreliable weak supervision. Theoretically, we extend existing bounds and derive tighter lower bounds for both forward and reverse KL divergence, establishing that reverse KL achieves at least comparable guarantees to forward KL. Notably, when a sufficiently pre-trained strong model is fine-tuned on the last linear layer, reverse KL guarantees that it outperforms its weak supervisor by the magnitude of their disagreement. Empirically, we demonstrate that reverse KL and reverse cross-entropy enable strong models to successfully outperform those trained with forward KL and standard cross-entropy across most settings, highlighting the practical advantages of these reverse losses.

Our approach enables direct compatibility with DeepSeek's codebase, allowing these models to fully leverage DeepSeek-specific optimizations such as vLLM and SGlang. By compressing 93% of the KV cache in LLaMA-2-7B, TransMLA achieves a 10.6x inference speedup at an 8K context length while preserving meaningful output quality. Additionally, the model requires only 6 billion tokens for fine-tuning to regain performance on par with the original across multiple benchmarks.

  A major challenge in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is the issue of distribution shift. LLM alignment algorithms rely on static preference datasets, assuming that they accurately represent real-world user preferences. However, user preferences vary significantly across geographical regions, demographics, linguistic patterns, and evolving cultural trends. This preference distribution shift leads to catastrophic alignment failures in many real-world applications. We address this problem using the principled framework of distributionally robust optimization, and develop two novel distributionally robust direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithms, namely, Wasserstein DPO (WDPO) and Kullback-Leibler DPO (KLDPO). We characterize the sample complexity of learning the optimal policy parameters for WDPO and KLDPO. Moreover, we propose scalable gradient descent-style learning algorithms by developing suitable approximations for the challenging minimax loss functions of WDPO and KLDPO. Our empirical experiments using benchmark data sets and LLMs demonstrate the superior performance of WDPO and KLDPO in substantially improving the alignment when there is a preference distribution shift.

  Large language models (LLMs) continue to face challenges in reliably solving reasoning tasks, particularly those that require precise rule following, as often found in mathematical reasoning. This paper introduces a novel neurosymbolic method that improves LLM reasoning by encoding hidden states into neurosymbolic vectors, enabling problem-solving within a neurosymbolic vector space. The results are decoded and merged with the original hidden state, significantly boosting the model's performance on numerical reasoning tasks. By offloading computation through neurosymbolic representations, this method enhances efficiency, reliability, and interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate an average of 88.6% lower cross-entropy loss and 15.4 times more problems correctly solved on a suite of mathematical reasoning tasks compared to chain-of-thought prompting and supervised fine-tuning (LoRA), without degrading performance on other tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach for solving complex mathematical and logical problems. However, it can often veer off track through incorrect or unsubstantiated inferences. Formal mathematical reasoning, which can be checked with a formal verifier, is one approach to addressing this issue. However, currently LLMs are simply not good enough to solve complex problems in a formal way, and even just formalizing an informal problem statement can be challenging. Motivated by this fact, in this work we consider the problem of learning reliable verifiers for natural language Chain-of-Thought reasoning. That is, given a problem statement and step-by-step solution in natural language, the aim of the verifier is to output [Yes] if the reasoning steps in the solution are all valid, and [No] otherwise. In this work we give a formal PAC-learning framework for studying this problem. We propose and analyze several natural verification goals, at different levels of strength, in this framework. We provide sample complexity upper-bounds for learning verifiers satisfying these goals, as well as lower-bound and impossibility results for learning other natural verification objectives without additional assumptions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conformance checking techniques detect undesired process behavior by comparing process executions that are recorded in event logs to desired behavior that is captured in a dedicated process model. If such models are not available, conformance checking techniques are not applicable, but organizations might still be interested in detecting undesired behavior in their processes. To enable this, existing approaches use Large Language Models (LLMs), assuming that they can learn to distinguish desired from undesired behavior through fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning is highly resource-intensive and the fine-tuned LLMs often do not generalize well. To address these limitations, we propose an approach that requires neither a dedicated process model nor resource-intensive fine-tuning to detect undesired process behavior. Instead, we use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide an LLM with direct access to a knowledge base that contains both desired and undesired process behavior from other processes, assuming that the LLM can transfer this knowledge to the process at hand. Our evaluation shows that our approach outperforms fine-tuned LLMs in detecting undesired behavior, demonstrating that RAG is a viable alternative to resource-intensive fine-tuning, particularly when enriched with relevant context from the event log, such as frequent traces and activities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In deep learning, regularization and normalization are common solutions for challenges such as overfitting, numerical instabilities, and the increasing variance in the residual stream. An alternative approach is to force all parameters and representations to lie on a hypersphere. This removes the need for regularization and increases convergence speed, but comes with additional costs. In this work, we propose a more holistic but approximate normalization (anTransformer). Our approach constrains the norm of parameters and normalizes all representations via scalar multiplications motivated by the tight concentration of the norms of high-dimensional random vectors. When applied to GPT training, we observe a 40% faster convergence compared to models with QK normalization, with less than 3% additional runtime. Deriving scaling laws for anGPT, we found our method enables training with larger batch sizes and fewer hyperparameters, while matching the favorable scaling characteristics of classic GPT architectures.

  _Zhendong Mi, Zhenglun Kong, Geng Yuan, Shaoyi Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), the demand for memory and computational resources has grown significantly. Recent advances in LLM pruning aim to reduce the size and computational cost of these models. However, existing methods often suffer from either suboptimal pruning performance or low time efficiency during the pruning process. In this work, we propose an efficient and effective pruning method that simultaneously achieves high pruning performance and fast pruning speed with improved calibration efficiency. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) An activation cosine similarity loss-guided pruning metric, which considers the angular deviation of the output activation between the dense and pruned models. (2) An activation variance-guided pruning metric, which helps preserve semantic distinctions in output activations after pruning, enabling effective pruning with shorter input sequences. These two components can be readily combined to enhance LLM pruning in both accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that our method achieves up to an 18% reduction in perplexity and up to 63% decrease in pruning time on prevalent LLMs such as LLaMA, LLaMA-2, and OPT.

  Predictive modeling on tabular data is the cornerstone of many real-world applications. Although gradient boosting machines and some recent deep models achieve strong performance on tabular data, they often lack interpretability. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities to generate human-like reasoning and explanations, but remain under-performed for tabular data prediction. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages reasoning-based LLMs, trained using reinforcement learning, to perform more accurate and explainable predictions on tabular data. Our method introduces custom reward functions that guide the model not only toward high prediction accuracy but also toward human-understandable reasons for its predictions. Experimental results show that our model achieves promising performance on financial benchmark datasets, outperforming most existing LLMs.

  Training foundation models such as ViTs and LLMs requires tremendous computing cost. Low-rank matrix or tensor factorization offers a parameter-efficient alternative, but often downgrades performance due to the restricted parameter space. In this work, we introduce {\textbf{Latent Crossing (LaX)}} -- a simple yet effective plug-and-play module that enhances the capacity of low-rank models by enabling information flow across low-rank subspaces. We extensively validate the benefits of LaX on pre-training tasks with ViT-Base/Large and LLaMA-like models ranging from 60M to 1B parameters. LaX boosts low-rank model performance to match or exceed the full-rank baselines while using 2-3\(\times\) fewer parameters. When equipped with low-rank adapters (i.e., LoRA) for fine-tuning LLaMA-7/13B, LaX consistently improves performance on arithmetic and common sense reasoning tasks with negligible cost.

  Visual presentations are vital for effective communication. Early attempts to automate their creation using deep learning often faced issues such as poorly organized layouts, inaccurate text summarization, and a lack of image understanding, leading to mismatched visuals and text. These limitations restrict their application in formal contexts like business and scientific research. To address these challenges, we propose PreGenie, an agentic and modular framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for generating high-quality visual presentations.PreGenie is built on the Slidev presentation framework, where slides are rendered from Markdown code. It operates in two stages: (1) Analysis and Initial Generation, which summarizes multimodal input and generates initial code, and (2) Review and Re-generation, which iteratively reviews intermediate code and rendered slides to produce final, high-quality presentations. Each stage leverages multiple MLLMs that collaborate and share information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PreGenie excels in multimodal understanding, outperforming existing models in both aesthetics and content consistency, while aligning more closely with human design preferences.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models become increasingly prevalent, memory bandwidth constraints significantly limit inference throughput, motivating post-training quantization (PTQ). In this paper, we propose FireQ, a co-designed PTQ framework and an INT4-FP8 matrix multiplication kernel that accelerates LLM inference across all linear layers. Specifically, FireQ quantizes linear layer weights and key-values to INT4, and activations and queries to FP8, significantly enhancing throughput. Additionally, we introduce a three-stage pipelining for the prefill phase, which modifies the FlashAttention-3 kernel, effectively reducing time-to-first-token in the prefill phase. To minimize accuracy loss from quantization, we develop novel outlier smoothing techniques tailored separately for linear and attention layers. In linear layers, we explicitly use per-tensor scaling to prevent underflow caused by the FP8 quantization scaling factor of INT4 quantization, and channel-wise scaling to compensate for coarse granularity of INT4. In attention layers, we address quantization challenges posed by rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) by combining pre-RoPE and post-RoPE scaling strategies. FireQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.68x faster inference in feed-forward network layers on Llama2-7B and 1.26x faster prefill phase performance on Llama3-8B compared to QServe, with negligible accuracy loss.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers a cost-effective solution for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), but it often produces overconfident predictions in data-scarce few-shot settings. To address this issue, several classical statistical learning approaches have been repurposed for scalable uncertainty-aware LoRA fine-tuning. However, these approaches neglect how input characteristics affect the predictive uncertainty estimates. To address this limitation, we propose Contextual Low-Rank Adaptation (\textbf{C-LoRA}) as a novel uncertainty-aware and parameter efficient fine-tuning approach, by developing new lightweight LoRA modules contextualized to each input data sample to dynamically adapt uncertainty estimates. Incorporating data-driven contexts into the parameter posteriors, C-LoRA mitigates overfitting, achieves well-calibrated uncertainties, and yields robust predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C-LoRA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art uncertainty-aware LoRA methods in both uncertainty quantification and model generalization. Ablation studies further confirm the critical role of our contextual modules in capturing sample-specific uncertainties. C-LoRA sets a new standard for robust, uncertainty-aware LLM fine-tuning in few-shot regimes.

  We propose to scale RL to unverifiable data with a novel algorithm JEPO (Jensen's Evidence lower bound Policy Optimization). While most prior efforts on scaling RL for LLMs focus on verifiable data where ground truth answers are typically short-form and can be matched easily; we investigate the case where such assumptions are less valid (e.g., when answers are long-form such as mathematical proofs). To scale RL training to unverifiable data with contemporary training constraints, we propose JEPO. JEPO applies Jensen's evidence lower bound, a pragmatic simplification of the evidence lower bound which views chain-of-thought as a latent variable in the generative process. We show that on verifiable data (math), JEPO is as effective as RL with verifiable rewards; on semi-verifiable data (numina), JEPO improves on soft-match based evaluations compared to RL with verifiable rewards which can only leverage a subset of the data source; finally, on unverifiable data (numina-proof), JEPO outperforms SFT and a few ablation baselines on likelihood evaluations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series analysis provides essential insights for real-world system dynamics and informs downstream decision-making, yet most existing methods often overlook the rich contextual signals present in auxiliary modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce TimeXL, a multi-modal prediction framework that integrates a prototype-based time series encoder with three collaborating Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver more accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. First, a multi-modal prototype-based encoder processes both time series and textual inputs to generate preliminary forecasts alongside case-based rationales. These outputs then feed into a prediction LLM, which refines the forecasts by reasoning over the encoder's predictions and explanations. Next, a reflection LLM compares the predicted values against the ground truth, identifying textual inconsistencies or noise. Guided by this feedback, a refinement LLM iteratively enhances text quality and triggers encoder retraining. This closed-loop workflow -- prediction, critique (reflect), and refinement -- continuously boosts the framework's performance and interpretability. Empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeXL achieves up to 8.9\% improvement in AUC and produces human-centric, multi-modal explanations, highlighting the power of LLM-driven reasoning for time series prediction.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans develop world models that capture the underlying generation process of data. Whether neural networks can learn similar world models remains an open problem. In this work, we present the first theoretical results for this problem, showing that in a multi-task setting, models with a low-degree bias provably recover latent data-generating variables under mild assumptions -- even if proxy tasks involve complex, non-linear functions of the latents. However, such recovery is sensitive to model architecture. Our analysis leverages Boolean models of task solutions via the Fourier-Walsh transform and introduces new techniques for analyzing invertible Boolean transforms, which may be of independent interest. We illustrate the algorithmic implications of our results and connect them to related research areas, including self-supervised learning, out-of-distribution generalization, and the linear representation hypothesis in large language models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As the general capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) agents continue to evolve, their ability to learn to master multiple complex tasks through experience remains a key challenge. Current LLM agents, particularly those based on proprietary language models, typically rely on prompts to incorporate knowledge about the target tasks. This approach does not allow the agent to internalize this information and instead relies on ever-expanding prompts to sustain its functionality in diverse scenarios. This resembles a system of notes used by a person affected by anterograde amnesia, the inability to form new memories. In this paper, we propose a novel method to train AI agents to incorporate knowledge and skills for multiple tasks without the need for either cumbersome note systems or prior high-quality demonstration data. Our approach employs an iterative process where the agent collects new experiences, receives corrective feedback from humans in the form of hints, and integrates this feedback into its weights via a context distillation training procedure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by implementing it in a Llama-3-based agent that, after only a few rounds of feedback, outperforms advanced models GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 in tasksets requiring correct sequencing of information retrieval, tool use, and question answering.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models. Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.

  Recent advancements in multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the automation of medical image analysis, particularly in generating radiology reports from chest X-rays (CXR). However, these models still suffer from hallucinations and clinically significant errors, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. In this study, we propose Look & Mark (L&M), a novel grounding fixation strategy that integrates radiologist eye fixations (Look) and bounding box annotations (Mark) into the LLM prompting framework. Unlike conventional fine-tuning, L&M leverages in-context learning to achieve substantial performance gains without retraining. When evaluated across multiple domain-specific and general-purpose models, L&M demonstrates significant gains, including a 1.2% improvement in overall metrics (this http URL) for CXR-LLaVA compared to baseline prompting and a remarkable 9.2% boost for LLaVA-Med. General-purpose models also benefit from L&M combined with in-context learning, with LLaVA-OV achieving an 87.3% clinical average performance (this http URL)-the highest among all models, even surpassing those explicitly trained for CXR report generation. Expert evaluations further confirm that L&M reduces clinically significant errors (by 0.43 average errors per report), such as false predictions and omissions, enhancing both accuracy and reliability. These findings highlight L&M's potential as a scalable and efficient solution for AI-assisted radiology, paving the way for improved diagnostic workflows in low-resource clinical settings.

  As a social being, we have an intimate bond with the environment. A plethora of things in human life, such as lifestyle, health, and food are dependent on the environment and agriculture. It comes under our responsibility to support the environment as well as agriculture. However, traditional farming practices often result in inefficient resource use and environmental challenges. To address these issues, precision agriculture has emerged as a promising approach that leverages advanced technologies to optimise agricultural processes. In this work, a hybrid approach is proposed that combines the three different potential fields of model AI: object detection, large language model (LLM), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In this novel framework, we have tried to combine the vision and language models to work together to identify potential diseases in the tree leaf. This study introduces a novel AI-based precision agriculture system that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide context-aware diagnoses and natural language processing (NLP) and YOLOv8 for crop disease detection. The system aims to tackle major issues with large language models (LLMs), especially hallucinations and allows for adaptive treatment plans and real-time disease detection. The system provides an easy-to-use interface to the farmers, which they can use to detect the different diseases related to coffee leaves by just submitting the image of the affected leaf the model will detect the diseases as well as suggest potential remediation methodologies which aim to lower the use of pesticides, preserving livelihoods, and encouraging environmentally friendly methods. With an emphasis on scalability, dependability, and user-friendliness, the project intends to improve RAG-integrated object detection systems for wider agricultural applications in the future.

  Ensuring robust and generalizable autonomous driving requires not only broad scenario coverage but also efficient repair of failure cases, particularly those related to challenging and safety-critical scenarios. However, existing scenario generation and selection methods often lack adaptivity and semantic relevance, limiting their impact on performance improvement. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SERA}, an LLM-powered framework that enables autonomous driving systems to self-evolve by repairing failure cases through targeted scenario recommendation. By analyzing performance logs, SERA identifies failure patterns and dynamically retrieves semantically aligned scenarios from a structured bank. An LLM-based reflection mechanism further refines these recommendations to maximize relevance and diversity. The selected scenarios are used for few-shot fine-tuning, enabling targeted adaptation with minimal data. Experiments on the benchmark show that SERA consistently improves key metrics across multiple autonomous driving baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability under safety-critical conditions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We explore Large Language Models (LLMs)' human motion knowledge through 3D avatar control. Given a motion instruction, we prompt LLMs to first generate a high-level movement plan with consecutive steps (High-level Planning), then specify body part positions in each step (Low-level Planning), which we linearly interpolate into avatar animations as a clear verification lens for human evaluators. Through carefully designed 20 representative motion instructions with full coverage of basic movement primitives and balanced body part usage, we conduct comprehensive evaluations including human assessment of both generated animations and high-level movement plans, as well as automatic comparison with oracle positions in low-level planning. We find that LLMs are strong at interpreting the high-level body movements but struggle with precise body part positioning. While breaking down motion queries into atomic components improves planning performance, LLMs have difficulty with multi-step movements involving high-degree-of-freedom body parts. Furthermore, LLMs provide reasonable approximation for general spatial descriptions, but fail to handle precise spatial specifications in text, and the precise spatial-temporal parameters needed for avatar control. Notably, LLMs show promise in conceptualizing creative motions and distinguishing culturally-specific motion patterns.

  While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at general vision-language tasks, visuospatial cognition - reasoning about spatial layouts, relations, and dynamics - remains a significant challenge. Existing models often lack the necessary architectural components and specialized training data for fine-grained spatial understanding. We introduce ViCA2 (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant 2), a novel MLLM designed to enhance spatial reasoning. ViCA2 features a dual vision encoder architecture integrating SigLIP for semantics and Hiera for spatial structure, coupled with a token ratio control mechanism for efficiency. We also developed ViCA-322K, a new large-scale dataset with over 322,000 spatially grounded question-answer pairs for targeted instruction tuning. On the challenging VSI-Bench benchmark, our ViCA2-7B model achieves a state-of-the-art average score of 56.8, significantly surpassing larger open-source models (e.g., LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B, 40.9) and leading proprietary models (Gemini-1.5 Pro, 45.4). This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in achieving strong visuospatial intelligence with a compact model. We release ViCA2, its codebase, and the ViCA-322K dataset to facilitate further research.

  Humans excel at performing complex tasks by leveraging long-term memory across temporal and spatial experiences. In contrast, current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively plan and act in dynamic, multi-room 3D environments. We posit that part of this limitation is due to the lack of proper 3D spatial-temporal memory modeling in LLMs. To address this, we first introduce 3DMem-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 26,000 trajectories and 2,892 embodied tasks, question-answering and captioning, designed to evaluate an agent's ability to reason over long-term memory in 3D environments. Second, we propose 3DLLM-Mem, a novel dynamic memory management and fusion model for embodied spatial-temporal reasoning and actions in LLMs. Our model uses working memory tokens, which represents current observations, as queries to selectively attend to and fuse the most useful spatial and temporal features from episodic memory, which stores past observations and interactions. Our approach allows the agent to focus on task-relevant information while maintaining memory efficiency in complex, long-horizon environments. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DLLM-Mem achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, outperforming the strongest baselines by 16.5% in success rate on 3DMem-Bench's most challenging in-the-wild embodied tasks.

  Text-to-image generation increasingly demands access to domain-specific, fine-grained, and rapidly evolving knowledge that pretrained models cannot fully capture. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods attempt to address this by retrieving globally relevant images, but they fail when no single image contains all desired elements from a complex user query. We propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in both retrieval and generation quality, while maintaining high efficiency.

  Image recaptioning is widely used to generate training datasets with enhanced quality for various multimodal tasks. Existing recaptioning methods typically rely on powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance textual descriptions, but often suffer from inaccuracies due to hallucinations and incompleteness caused by missing fine-grained details. To address these limitations, we propose RICO, a novel framework that refines captions through visual reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage a text-to-image model to reconstruct a caption into a reference image, and prompt an MLLM to identify discrepancies between the original and reconstructed images to refine the caption. This process is performed iteratively, further progressively promoting the generation of more faithful and comprehensive descriptions. To mitigate the additional computational cost induced by the iterative process, we introduce RICO-Flash, which learns to generate captions like RICO using DPO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves caption accuracy and completeness, outperforms most baselines by approximately 10% on both CapsBench and CompreCap.

  Next-token prediction serves as the foundational learning task enabling reasoning in LLMs. But what should the learning task be when aiming to equip MLLMs with temporal reasoning capabilities over video inputs? Existing tasks such as video question answering often rely on annotations from humans or much stronger MLLMs, while video captioning tends to entangle temporal reasoning with spatial information. To address this gap, we propose next-event prediction (NEP), a learning task that harnesses future video segments as a rich, self-supervised signal to foster temporal reasoning. We segment each video into past and future frames: the MLLM takes the past frames as input and predicts a summary of events derived from the future frames, thereby encouraging the model to reason temporally in order to complete the task. To support this task, we curate V1-33K, a dataset comprising 33,000 automatically extracted video segments spanning diverse real-world scenarios. We further explore a range of video instruction-tuning strategies to study their effects on temporal reasoning. To evaluate progress, we introduce FutureBench to assess coherence in predicting unseen future events. Experiments validate that NEP offers a scalable and effective training paradigm for fostering temporal reasoning in MLLMs.

  Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset. Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided, yielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form video understanding tasks. The code will be released later.

  Tactile perception is essential for embodied agents to understand physical attributes of objects that cannot be determined through visual inspection alone. While existing approaches have made progress in visual and language modalities for physical understanding, they fail to effectively incorporate tactile information that provides crucial haptic feedback for real-world interaction. In this paper, we present VTV-LLM, the first multi-modal large language model for universal Visuo-Tactile Video (VTV) understanding that bridges the gap between tactile perception and natural language. To address the challenges of cross-sensor and cross-modal integration, we contribute VTV150K, a comprehensive dataset comprising 150,000 video frames from 100 diverse objects captured across three different tactile sensors (GelSight Mini, DIGIT, and Tac3D), annotated with four fundamental tactile attributes (hardness, protrusion, elasticity, and friction). We develop a novel three-stage training paradigm that includes VTV enhancement for robust visuo-tactile representation, VTV-text alignment for cross-modal correspondence, and text prompt finetuning for natural language generation. Our framework enables sophisticated tactile reasoning capabilities including feature assessment, comparative analysis, scenario-based decision making and so on. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that VTV-LLM achieves superior performance in tactile video understanding tasks, establishing a foundation for more intuitive human-machine interaction in tactile domains.

  To understand a prompt, Vision-Language models (VLMs) must perceive the image, comprehend the text, and build associations within and across both modalities. For instance, given an 'image of a red toy car', the model should associate this image to phrases like 'car', 'red toy', 'red object', etc. Feng and Steinhardt propose the Binding ID mechanism in LLMs, suggesting that the entity and its corresponding attribute tokens share a Binding ID in the model activations. We investigate this for image-text binding in VLMs using a synthetic dataset and task that requires models to associate 3D objects in an image with their descriptions in the text. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs assign a distinct Binding ID to an object's image tokens and its textual references, enabling in-context association.

  Recent years have seen rapid advances in AI-driven image generation. Early diffusion models emphasized perceptual quality, while newer multimodal models like GPT-4o-image integrate high-level reasoning, improving semantic understanding and structural composition. Scientific illustration generation exemplifies this evolution: unlike general image synthesis, it demands accurate interpretation of technical content and transformation of abstract ideas into clear, standardized visuals. This task is significantly more knowledge-intensive and laborious, often requiring hours of manual work and specialized tools. Automating it in a controllable, intelligent manner would provide substantial practical value. Yet, no benchmark currently exists to evaluate AI on this front. To fill this gap, we introduce SridBench, the first benchmark for scientific figure generation. It comprises 1,120 instances curated from leading scientific papers across 13 natural and computer science disciplines, collected via human experts and MLLMs. Each sample is evaluated along six dimensions, including semantic fidelity and structural accuracy. Experimental results reveal that even top-tier models like GPT-4o-image lag behind human performance, with common issues in text/visual clarity and scientific correctness. These findings highlight the need for more advanced reasoning-driven visual generation capabilities.

  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive applications such as virtual and augmented reality, where first-person (egocentric) view captured by head-mounted cameras serves as key input. While this view offers fine-grained cues about user attention and hand-object interactions, their narrow field of view and lack of global context often lead to failures on spatially or contextually demanding queries. To address this, we introduce a framework that augments egocentric inputs with third-person (exocentric) views, providing complementary information such as global scene layout and object visibility to LVLMs. We present E3VQA, the first benchmark for multi-view question answering with 4K high-quality question-answer pairs grounded in synchronized ego-exo image pairs. Additionally, we propose M3CoT, a training-free prompting technique that constructs a unified scene representation by integrating scene graphs from three complementary perspectives. M3CoT enables LVLMs to reason more effectively across views, yielding consistent performance gains (4.84% for GPT-4o and 5.94% for Gemini 2.0 Flash) over a recent CoT baseline. Our extensive evaluation reveals key strengths and limitations of LVLMs in multi-view reasoning and highlights the value of leveraging both egocentric and exocentric inputs.

  Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in general visual reasoning but remain underexplored in Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR), which demands higher-order reasoning to identify abstract rules beyond simple perception. Existing AVR benchmarks focus on single-step reasoning, emphasizing the end result but neglecting the multi-stage nature of reasoning process. Past studies found MLLMs struggle with these benchmarks, but it doesn't explain how they fail. To address this gap, we introduce MultiStAR, a Multi-Stage AVR benchmark, based on RAVEN, designed to assess reasoning across varying levels of complexity. Additionally, existing metrics like accuracy only focus on the final outcomes while do not account for the correctness of intermediate steps. Therefore, we propose a novel metric, MSEval, which considers the correctness of intermediate steps in addition to the final outcomes. We conduct comprehensive experiments on MultiStAR using 17 representative close-source and open-source MLLMs. The results reveal that while existing MLLMs perform adequately on basic perception tasks, they continue to face challenges in more complex rule detection stages.

  Multimodal tables those that integrate semi structured data with visual elements such as charts and maps are ubiquitous across real world domains, yet they pose a formidable challenge to current vision language models (VLMs). While Large Language models (LLMs) and VLMs have demonstrated strong capabilities in text and image understanding, their performance on complex, real world multimodal table reasoning remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMTBENCH (Multimodal Table Benchmark), a benchmark consisting of 500 real world multimodal tables drawn from diverse real world sources, with a total of 4021 question answer pairs. MMTBENCH questions cover four question types (Explicit, Implicit, Answer Mention, and Visual Based), five reasoning types (Mathematical, Extrema Identification, Fact Verification, Vision Based, and Others), and eight table types (Single/Multiple Entity, Maps and Charts with Entities, Single/Multiple Charts, Maps, and Visualizations). Extensive evaluation of state of the art models on all types reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly on questions requiring visual-based reasoning and multi-step inference. These findings show the urgent need for improved architectures that more tightly integrate vision and language processing. By providing a challenging, high-quality resource that mirrors the complexity of real-world tasks, MMTBENCH underscores its value as a resource for future research on multimodal tables.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual understanding in recent years. Yet, they still lag behind human capabilities in specific visual tasks such as counting or relational reasoning. To understand the underlying limitations, we adopt methodologies from cognitive science, analyzing VLM performance along core cognitive axes: Perception, Attention, and Memory. Using a suite of tasks targeting these abilities, we evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o. Our analysis reveals distinct cognitive profiles: while advanced models approach ceiling performance on some tasks (e.g. category identification), a significant gap persists, particularly in tasks requiring spatial understanding or selective attention. Investigating the source of these failures and potential methods for improvement, we employ a vision-text decoupling analysis, finding that models struggling with direct visual reasoning show marked improvement when reasoning over their own generated text captions. These experiments reveal a strong need for improved VLM Chain-of-Thought (CoT) abilities, even in models that consistently exceed human performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of targeted fine-tuning on composite visual reasoning tasks and show that fine-tuning smaller VLMs substantially improves core cognitive abilities. While this improvement does not translate to large enhancements on challenging, out-of-distribution benchmarks, we show broadly that VLM performance on our datasets strongly correlates with performance on these other benchmarks. Our work provides a detailed analysis of VLM cognitive strengths and weaknesses and identifies key bottlenecks in simultaneous perception and reasoning while also providing an effective and simple solution.

  Subject-to-Video (S2V) generation aims to create videos that faithfully incorporate reference content, providing enhanced flexibility in the production of videos. To establish the infrastructure for S2V generation, we propose OpenS2V-Nexus, consisting of (i) OpenS2V-Eval, a fine-grained benchmark, and (ii) OpenS2V-5M, a million-scale dataset. In contrast to existing S2V benchmarks inherited from VBench that focus on global and coarse-grained assessment of generated videos, OpenS2V-Eval focuses on the model's ability to generate subject-consistent videos with natural subject appearance and identity fidelity. For these purposes, OpenS2V-Eval introduces 180 prompts from seven major categories of S2V, which incorporate both real and synthetic test data. Furthermore, to accurately align human preferences with S2V benchmarks, we propose three automatic metrics, NexusScore, NaturalScore and GmeScore, to separately quantify subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16 representative S2V models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses across different content. Moreover, we create the first open-source large-scale S2V generation dataset OpenS2V-5M, which consists of five million high-quality 720P subject-text-video triples. Specifically, we ensure subject-information diversity in our dataset by (1) segmenting subjects and building pairing information via cross-video associations and (2) prompting GPT-Image-1 on raw frames to synthesize multi-view representations. Through OpenS2V-Nexus, we deliver a robust infrastructure to accelerate future S2V generation research.

  Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a cornerstone in multimodal intelligence. However, recent studies discovered that CLIP can only encode one aspect of the feature space, leading to substantial information loss and indistinctive features. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces a novel strategy that fine-tunes a series of complementary CLIP models and transforms them into a CLIP-MoE. Specifically, we propose a model-agnostic Diversified Multiplet Upcycling (DMU) framework for CLIP. Instead of training multiple CLIP models from scratch, DMU leverages a pre-trained CLIP and fine-tunes it into a diverse set with highly cost-effective multistage contrastive learning, thus capturing distinct feature subspaces efficiently. To fully exploit these fine-tuned models while minimizing computational overhead, we transform them into a CLIP-MoE, which dynamically activates a subset of CLIP experts, achieving an effective balance between model capacity and computational cost. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of CLIP-MoE across various zero-shot retrieval, zero-shot image classification tasks, and downstream Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) benchmarks when used as a vision encoder.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision language models (VLMs) typically pair a modestly sized vision encoder with a large language model (LLM), e.g., Llama-70B, making the decoder the primary computational burden during training. To reduce costs, a potential promising strategy is to first train the vision encoder using a small language model before transferring it to the large one. We construct small "surrogate models" that share the same embedding space and representation language as the large target LLM by directly inheriting its shallow layers. Vision encoders trained on the surrogate can then be directly transferred to the larger model, a process we call zero-shot grafting -- when plugged directly into the full-size target LLM, the grafted pair surpasses the encoder-surrogate pair and, on some benchmarks, even performs on par with full decoder training with the target LLM. Furthermore, our surrogate training approach reduces overall VLM training costs by ~45% when using Llama-70B as the decoder.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Stylized abstraction synthesizes visually exaggerated yet semantically faithful representations of subjects, balancing recognizability with perceptual distortion. Unlike image-to-image translation, which prioritizes structural fidelity, stylized abstraction demands selective retention of identity cues while embracing stylistic divergence, especially challenging for out-of-distribution individuals. We propose a training-free framework that generates stylized abstractions from a single image using inference-time scaling in vision-language models (VLLMs) to extract identity-relevant features, and a novel cross-domain rectified flow inversion strategy that reconstructs structure based on style-dependent priors. Our method adapts structural restoration dynamically through style-aware temporal scheduling, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions that honor both subject and style. It supports multi-round abstraction-aware generation without fine-tuning. To evaluate this task, we introduce StyleBench, a GPT-based human-aligned metric suited for abstract styles where pixel-level similarity fails. Experiments across diverse abstraction (e.g., LEGO, knitted dolls, South Park) show strong generalization to unseen identities and styles in a fully open-source setup.

  Generating high-quality, multi-layer transparent images from text prompts can unlock a new level of creative control, allowing users to edit each layer as effortlessly as editing text outputs from LLMs. However, the development of multi-layer generative models lags behind that of conventional text-to-image models due to the absence of a large, high-quality corpus of multi-layer transparent data. In this paper, we address this fundamental challenge by: (i) releasing the first open, ultra-high-fidelity PrismLayers (PrismLayersPro) dataset of 200K (20K) multilayer transparent images with accurate alpha mattes, (ii) introducing a trainingfree synthesis pipeline that generates such data on demand using off-the-shelf diffusion models, and (iii) delivering a strong, open-source multi-layer generation model, ART+, which matches the aesthetics of modern text-to-image generation models. The key technical contributions include: LayerFLUX, which excels at generating high-quality single transparent layers with accurate alpha mattes, and MultiLayerFLUX, which composes multiple LayerFLUX outputs into complete images, guided by human-annotated semantic layout. To ensure higher quality, we apply a rigorous filtering stage to remove artifacts and semantic mismatches, followed by human selection. Fine-tuning the state-of-the-art ART model on our synthetic PrismLayersPro yields ART+, which outperforms the original ART in 60% of head-to-head user study comparisons and even matches the visual quality of images generated by the FLUX.1-[dev] model. We anticipate that our work will establish a solid dataset foundation for the multi-layer transparent image generation task, enabling research and applications that require precise, editable, and visually compelling layered imagery.

  Diffusion models have recently demonstrated exceptional performance in image generation task. However, existing image generation methods still significantly suffer from the dilemma of image reasoning, especially in logic-centered image generation tasks. Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) in LLMs, we propose SRRL, a self-reflective RL algorithm for diffusion models to achieve reasoning generation of logical images by performing reflection and iteration across generation trajectories. The intermediate samples in the denoising process carry noise, making accurate reward evaluation difficult. To address this challenge, SRRL treats the entire denoising trajectory as a CoT step with multi-round reflective denoising process and introduces condition guided forward process, which allows for reflective iteration between CoT steps. Through SRRL-based iterative diffusion training, we introduce image reasoning through CoT into generation tasks adhering to physical laws and unconventional physical phenomena for the first time. Notably, experimental results of case study exhibit that the superior performance of our SRRL algorithm even compared with GPT-4o. The project page isthis https URL.

  Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at single-image tasks but struggle with multi-image understanding due to cross-modal misalignment, leading to hallucinations (context omission, conflation, and misinterpretation). Existing methods using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) constrain optimization to a solitary image reference within the input sequence, neglecting holistic context modeling. We propose Context-to-Cue Direct Preference Optimization (CcDPO), a multi-level preference optimization framework that enhances per-image perception in multi-image settings by zooming into visual clues -- from sequential context to local details. It features: (i) Context-Level Optimization : Re-evaluates cognitive biases underlying MLLMs' multi-image context comprehension and integrates a spectrum of low-cost global sequence preferences for bias mitigation. (ii) Needle-Level Optimization : Directs attention to fine-grained visual details through region-targeted visual prompts and multimodal preference supervision. To support scalable optimization, we also construct MultiScope-42k, an automatically generated dataset with high-quality multi-level preference pairs. Experiments show that CcDPO significantly reduces hallucinations and yields consistent performance gains across general single- and multi-image tasks.

  Computer-aided design (CAD) is crucial in prototyping 3D objects through geometric instructions (i.e., CAD programs). In practical design workflows, designers often engage in time-consuming reviews and refinements of these prototypes by comparing them with reference images. To bridge this gap, we introduce the CAD review task to automatically detect and correct potential errors, ensuring consistency between the constructed 3D objects and reference images. However, recent advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to recognize multiple geometric components and perform spatial geometric operations within the CAD program, leading to inaccurate reviews. In this paper, we propose the CAD program repairer (ReCAD) framework to effectively detect program errors and provide helpful feedback on error correction. Additionally, we create a dataset, CADReview, consisting of over 20K program-image pairs, with diverse errors for the CAD review task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReCAD significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, which shows great potential in design applications.

  While anomaly detection has made significant progress, generating detailed analyses that incorporate industrial knowledge remains a challenge. To address this gap, we introduce OmniAD, a novel framework that unifies anomaly detection and understanding for fine-grained analysis. OmniAD is a multimodal reasoner that combines visual and textual reasoning processes. The visual reasoning provides detailed inspection by leveraging Text-as-Mask Encoding to perform anomaly detection through text generation without manually selected thresholds. Following this, Visual Guided Textual Reasoning conducts comprehensive analysis by integrating visual perception. To enhance few-shot generalization, we employ an integrated training strategy that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (GRPO), incorporating three sophisticated reward functions. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniAD achieves a performance of 79.1 on the MMAD benchmark, surpassing models such as Qwen2.5-VL-7B and GPT-4o. It also shows strong results across multiple anomaly detection benchmarks. These results highlight the importance of enhancing visual perception for effective reasoning in anomaly understanding. All codes and models will be publicly available.

  Recent video diffusion models have demonstrated their great capability in generating visually-pleasing results, while synthesizing the correct physical effects in generated videos remains challenging. The complexity of real-world motions, interactions, and dynamics introduce great difficulties when learning physics from data. In this work, we propose DiffPhy, a generic framework that enables physically-correct and photo-realistic video generation by fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion model. Our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to explicitly reason a comprehensive physical context from the text prompt and use it to guide the generation. To incorporate physical context into the diffusion model, we leverage a Multimodal large language model (MLLM) as a supervisory signal and introduce a set of novel training objectives that jointly enforce physical correctness and semantic consistency with the input text. We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPhy is able to produce state-of-the-art results across diverse physics-related scenarios.

  Object orientation understanding represents a fundamental challenge in visual perception critical for applications like robotic manipulation and augmented reality. Current vision-language benchmarks fail to isolate this capability, often conflating it with positional relationships and general scene understanding. We introduce DORI (Discriminative Orientation Reasoning Intelligence), a comprehensive benchmark establishing object orientation perception as a primary evaluation target. DORI assesses four dimensions of orientation comprehension: frontal alignment, rotational transformations, relative directional relationships, and canonical orientation understanding. Through carefully curated tasks from 11 datasets spanning 67 object categories across synthetic and real-world scenarios, DORI provides insights on how multi-modal systems understand object orientations. Our evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art vision-language models reveals critical limitations: even the best models achieve only 54.2% accuracy on coarse tasks and 33.0% on granular orientation judgments, with performance deteriorating for tasks requiring reference frame shifts or compound rotations. These findings demonstrate the need for dedicated orientation representation mechanisms, as models show systematic inability to perform precise angular estimations, track orientation changes across viewpoints, and understand compound rotations - suggesting limitations in their internal 3D spatial representations. As the first diagnostic framework specifically designed for orientation awareness in multimodal systems, DORI offers implications for improving robotic control, 3D scene reconstruction, and human-AI interaction in physical environments.

  Video large language models (video LLMs) excel at video comprehension but face significant computational inefficiency due to redundant video tokens. Existing token pruning methods offer solutions. However, approaches operating within the LLM (inner-LLM pruning), such as FastV, incur intrinsic computational overhead in shallow layers. In contrast, methods performing token pruning before the LLM (outer-LLM pruning) primarily address spatial redundancy within individual frames or limited temporal windows, neglecting the crucial global temporal dynamics and correlations across longer video sequences. This leads to sub-optimal spatio-temporal reduction and does not leverage video compressibility fully. Crucially, the synergistic potential and mutual influence of combining these strategies remain unexplored. To further reduce redundancy, we introduce HoliTom, a novel training-free holistic token merging framework. HoliTom employs outer-LLM pruning through global redundancy-aware temporal segmentation, followed by spatial-temporal merging to reduce visual tokens by over 90%, significantly alleviating the LLM's computational burden. Complementing this, we introduce a robust inner-LLM token similarity-based merging approach, designed for superior performance and compatibility with outer-LLM pruning. Evaluations demonstrate our method's promising efficiency-performance trade-off on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, reducing computational costs to 6.9% of FLOPs while maintaining 99.1% of the original performance. Furthermore, we achieve a 2.28x reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and a 1.32x acceleration in decoding throughput, highlighting the practical benefits of our integrated pruning approach for efficient video LLMs inference.

  The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLRMs) has enabled sophisticated visual reasoning capabilities by integrating reinforcement learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. However, while these enhanced reasoning capabilities improve performance, they also introduce new and underexplored safety risks. In this work, we systematically investigate the security implications of advanced visual reasoning in MLRMs. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: as visual reasoning improves, models become more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Motivated by this critical finding, we introduce VisCRA (Visual Chain Reasoning Attack), a novel jailbreak framework that exploits the visual reasoning chains to bypass safety mechanisms. VisCRA combines targeted visual attention masking with a two-stage reasoning induction strategy to precisely control harmful outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate VisCRA's significant effectiveness, achieving high attack success rates on leading closed-source MLRMs: 76.48% on Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, 68.56% on QvQ-Max, and 56.60% on GPT-4o. Our findings highlight a critical insight: the very capability that empowers MLRMs -- their visual reasoning -- can also serve as an attack vector, posing significant security risks.

  Recent multimodal image generators such as GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro excel at following complex instructions, editing images and maintaining concept consistency. However, they are still evaluated by disjoint toolkits: text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks that lacks multi-modal conditioning, and customized image generation benchmarks that overlook compositional semantics and common knowledge. We propose MMIG-Bench, a comprehensive Multi-Modal Image Generation Benchmark that unifies these tasks by pairing 4,850 richly annotated text prompts with 1,750 multi-view reference images across 380 subjects, spanning humans, animals, objects, and artistic styles. MMIG-Bench is equipped with a three-level evaluation framework: (1) low-level metrics for visual artifacts and identity preservation of objects; (2) novel Aspect Matching Score (AMS): a VQA-based mid-level metric that delivers fine-grained prompt-image alignment and shows strong correlation with human judgments; and (3) high-level metrics for aesthetics and human preference. Using MMIG-Bench, we benchmark 17 state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro, FLUX, DreamBooth, and IP-Adapter, and validate our metrics with 32k human ratings, yielding in-depth insights into architecture and data design.

  Recently, multi-modal large language models have made significant progress. However, visual information lacking of guidance from the user's intention may lead to redundant computation and involve unnecessary visual noise, especially in long, untrimmed videos. To address this issue, we propose FocusChat, a text-guided multi-modal large language model (LLM) that emphasizes visual information correlated to the user's prompt. In detail, Our model first undergoes the semantic extraction module, which comprises a visual semantic branch and a text semantic branch to extract image and text semantics, respectively. The two branches are combined using the Spatial-Temporal Filtering Module (STFM). STFM enables explicit spatial-level information filtering and implicit temporal-level feature filtering, ensuring that the visual tokens are closely aligned with the user's query. It lowers the essential number of visual tokens inputted into the LLM. FocusChat significantly outperforms Video-LLaMA in zero-shot experiments, using an order of magnitude less training data with only 16 visual tokens occupied. It achieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art in few-shot experiments, with only 0.72M pre-training data.

  Text-Centric Visual Question Answering (TEC-VQA) in its proper format not only facilitates human-machine interaction in text-centric visual environments but also serves as a de facto gold proxy to evaluate AI models in the domain of text-centric scene understanding. Nonetheless, most existing TEC-VQA benchmarks have focused on high-resource languages like English and Chinese. Despite pioneering works to expand multilingual QA pairs in non-text-centric VQA datasets through translation engines, the translation-based protocol encounters a substantial "visual-textual misalignment" problem when applied to TEC-VQA. Specifically, it prioritizes the text in question-answer pairs while disregarding the visual text present in images. Moreover, it fails to address complexities related to nuanced meaning, contextual distortion, language bias, and question-type diversity. In this work, we tackle multilingual TEC-VQA by introducing MTVQA, the first benchmark featuring high-quality human expert annotations across 9 diverse languages, consisting of 6,778 question-answer pairs across 2,116 images. Further, by comprehensively evaluating numerous state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models~(MLLMs), including Qwen2-VL, GPT-4o, GPT-4V, Claude3, and Gemini, on the MTVQA benchmark, it is evident that there is still a large room for performance improvement (Qwen2-VL scoring 30.9 versus 79.7 for human performance), underscoring the value of MTVQA. Additionally, we supply multilingual training data within the MTVQA dataset, demonstrating that straightforward fine-tuning with this data can substantially enhance multilingual TEC-VQA performance. We aspire that MTVQA will offer the research community fresh insights and stimulate further exploration in multilingual visual text comprehension. The project homepage is available atthis https URL.

  The reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on complex reasoning tasks but often suffer from overthinking, generating unnecessarily long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths for easy reasoning questions, thereby increasing inference cost and latency. Recent approaches attempt to address this challenge by manually deciding when to apply long or short reasoning. However, they lack the flexibility to adapt CoT length dynamically based on question complexity. In this paper, we propose Auto Long-Short Reasoning (AutoL2S), a dynamic and model-agnostic framework that enables LLMs to dynamically compress their generated reasoning path based on the complexity of the reasoning question. AutoL2S enables a learned paradigm, in which LLMs themselves can decide when longer reasoning is necessary and when shorter reasoning suffices, by training on data annotated with our proposed method, which includes both long and short CoT paths and a special <EASY> token. We then use <EASY> token to indicate when the model can skip generating lengthy CoT reasoning. This proposed annotation strategy can enhance the LLMs' ability to generate shorter CoT reasoning paths with improved quality after training. Extensive evaluation results show that AutoL2S reduces the length of reasoning generation by up to 57% without compromising performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoL2S for scalable and efficient LLM reasoning.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in familiar contexts, but struggle when the context conflicts with their parametric knowledge. To investigate this phenomenon, we introduce CounterLogic, a dataset containing 1,800 examples across 9 logical schemas, explicitly designed to evaluate logical reasoning through counterfactual (hypothetical knowledge-conflicting) scenarios. Our systematic evaluation of 11 LLMs across 6 different datasets reveals a consistent performance degradation, with accuracies dropping by 27% on average when reasoning through counterfactual information. We propose Self-Segregate, a prompting method enabling metacognitive awareness (explicitly identifying knowledge conflicts) before reasoning. Our method dramatically narrows the average performance gaps from 27% to just 11%, while significantly increasing the overall accuracy (+7.5%). We discuss the implications of these findings and draw parallels to human cognitive processes, particularly on how humans disambiguate conflicting information during reasoning tasks. Our findings offer practical insights for understanding and enhancing LLMs reasoning capabilities in real-world applications, especially where models must logically reason independently of their factual knowledge.

  Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language processing tasks by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms. However, long-context modeling faces significant computational inefficiencies due to \textit{redundant} attention computations: while attention weights are often \textit{sparse}, all tokens consume \textit{equal} computational resources. In this paper, we reformulate traditional probabilistic sequence modeling as a \textit{supervised learning task}, enabling the separation of relevant and irrelevant tokens and providing a clearer understanding of redundancy. Based on this reformulation, we theoretically analyze attention sparsity, revealing that only a few tokens significantly contribute to predictions. Building on this, we formulate attention optimization as a linear coding problem and propose a \textit{group coding strategy}, theoretically showing its ability to improve robustness against random noise and enhance learning efficiency. Motivated by this, we propose \textit{Dynamic Group Attention} (DGA), which leverages the group coding to explicitly reduce redundancy by aggregating less important tokens during attention computation. Empirical results show that our DGA significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining competitivethis http URLis available atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models have significantly advanced natural language processing, achieving remarkable performance in tasks such as language generation, translation, and reasoning. However, their substantial computational requirements restrict deployment to high-end systems, limiting accessibility on consumer-grade devices. This challenge is especially pronounced for under-resourced languages like those spoken in the Iberian Peninsula, where relatively limited linguistic resources and benchmarks hinder effective evaluation. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of compact state-of-the-art LLMs across several essential NLP tasks tailored for Iberian languages. The results reveal that while some models consistently excel in certain tasks, significant performance gaps remain, particularly for languages such as Basque. These findings highlight the need for further research on balancing model compactness with robust multilingual performance

  Probabilistic reasoning is a key aspect of both human and artificial intelligence that allows for handling uncertainty and ambiguity in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce a new numerical reasoning task under uncertainty for large language models, focusing on estimating the privacy risk of user-generated documents containing privacy-sensitive information. We propose BRANCH, a new LLM methodology that estimates the k-privacy value of a text-the size of the population matching the given information. BRANCH factorizes a joint probability distribution of personal information as random variables. The probability of each factor in a population is estimated separately using a Bayesian network and combined to compute the final k-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the k-value 73% of the time, a 13% increase compared to o3-mini with chain-of-thought reasoning. We also find that LLM uncertainty is a good indicator for accuracy, as high-variance predictions are 37.47% less accurate on average.

  Large language models (LLMs) have gained extended context windows through scaling positional encodings and lightweight continual pre-training. However, this often leads to degraded performance on short-text tasks, while the reasons for this degradation remain insufficiently explored. In this work, we identify two primary factors contributing to this issue: distribution drift in hidden states and attention scores, and catastrophic forgetting during continual pre-training. To address these challenges, we propose Long Context Pre-training with Restoration Distillation (LongReD), a novel approach designed to mitigate short-text performance degradation through minimizing the distribution discrepancy between the extended and original models. Besides training on long texts, LongReD distills the hidden state of selected layers from the original model on short texts. Additionally, LongReD also introduces a short-to-long distillation, aligning the output distribution on short texts with that on long texts by leveraging skipped positional indices. Experiments on common text benchmarks demonstrate that LongReD effectively preserves the model's short-text performance while maintaining comparable or even better capacity to handle long texts than baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on various natural language tasks. However, they are trained on static corpora and their knowledge can become outdated quickly in the fast-changing world. This motivates the development of knowledge editing (KE) to update specific knowledge in LLMs without changing unrelated others or compromising their pre-trained capabilities. Previous efforts sought to update a small amount of parameters of a LLM and proved effective for making selective updates. Nonetheless, the edited LLM often exhibits degraded ability to reason about the new knowledge. In this work, we identify a key issue: heterogeneous token overfitting (HTO), where the LLM overfits different tokens in the provided knowledge at varying rates. To tackle this, we propose OVERTONE, a token-level smoothing method that mitigates HTO by adaptively refining the target distribution. Theoretically, OVERTONE offers better parameter updates with negligible computation overhead. It also induces an implicit DPO but does not require preference data pairs. Extensive experiments across four editing methods, two LLMs, and diverse scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied to downstream domains. However, current LLMs for high-stakes domain tasks, such as financial investment and legal QA, typically generate brief answers without reasoning processes and explanations. This limits users' confidence in making decisions based on their responses. While original CoT shows promise, it lacks self-correction mechanisms during reasoning. This work introduces Domain$o1$s, which enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities on domain tasks through supervised fine-tuning and tree search. We construct CoT-stock-2k and CoT-legal-2k datasets for fine-tuning models that activate domain-specific reasoning steps based on their judgment. Additionally, we propose Selective Tree Exploration to spontaneously explore solution spaces and sample optimal reasoning paths to improve performance. We also introduce PROOF-Score, a new metric for evaluating domain models' explainability, complementing traditional accuracy metrics with richer assessment dimensions. Extensive experiments on stock investment recommendation and legal reasoning QA tasks demonstrate Domaino1s's leading performance and explainability. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Counterfactual examples are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) as valuable data to improve models, and in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to understand model behavior. The automated generation of counterfactual examples remains a challenging task even for large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance on many tasks. In this paper, we first introduce ZeroCF, a faithful approach for leveraging important words derived from feature attribution methods to generate counterfactual examples in a zero-shot setting. Second, we present a new framework, FitCF, which further verifies aforementioned counterfactuals by label flip verification and then inserts them as demonstrations for few-shot prompting, outperforming two state-of-the-art baselines. Through ablation studies, we identify the importance of each of FitCF's core components in improving the quality of counterfactuals, as assessed through flip rate, perplexity, and similarity measures. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of LIME and Integrated Gradients as backbone attribution methods for FitCF and find that the number of demonstrations has the largest effect on performance. Finally, we reveal a strong correlation between the faithfulness of feature attribution scores and the quality of generated counterfactuals, which we hope will serve as an important finding for future research in this direction.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable success in extensive tasks primarily attributed to self-attention mechanism, which requires a token to consider all preceding tokens as its context to compute attention. However, when the context length L becomes very large (e.g., 128K), the amount of potentially redundant information in the context tends to increase. The redundant context not only hampers the modeling representation performance but also incurs unnecessary computational and storage overhead. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play Core Context Aware (CCA) Attention for efficient long-context modeling, comprising two complementary modules: 1) Globality-aware pooling module groups input tokens and dynamically compresses each group into one core token based on their significance. In this way, our method automatically focuses and strengthens core context while diminishing redundancy during the learning process, leading to effective long-term dependency modeling. 2) Locality-preserving module incorporates neighboring tokens to preserve local context for detailed representation. Notably, our CCA-Attention is able to replace the self-attention module in existing LLMs with minimal fine-tuning cost. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of our method in both long-context modeling and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.

  Although large language models demonstrate strong performance across various domains, they still struggle with numerous bad cases in mathematical reasoning. Previous approaches to learning from errors synthesize training data by solely extrapolating from isolated bad cases, thereby failing to generalize the extensive patterns inherent within these cases. This paper presents Self-Error-Instruct (SEI), a framework that addresses these model weaknesses and synthesizes more generalized targeted training data. Specifically, we explore a target model on two mathematical datasets, GSM8K and MATH, to pinpoint bad cases. Then, we generate error keyphrases for these cases based on the instructor model's (GPT-4o) analysis and identify error types by clustering these keyphrases. Next, we sample a few bad cases during each generation for each identified error type and input them into the instructor model, which synthesizes additional training data using a self-instruct approach. This new data is refined through a one-shot learning process to ensure that only the most effective examples are kept. Finally, we use these curated data to fine-tune the target model, iteratively repeating the process to enhance performance. We apply our framework to various models and observe improvements in their reasoning abilities across both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematics datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of self-error instruction in improving LLMs' mathematical reasoning through error generalization.

  High-quality multilingual training data is essential for effectively pretraining large language models (LLMs). Yet, the availability of suitable open-source multilingual datasets remains limited. Existing state-of-the-art datasets mostly rely on heuristic filtering methods, restricting both their cross-lingual transferability and scalability. Here, we introduce JQL, a systematic approach that efficiently curates diverse and high-quality multilingual data at scale while significantly reducing computational demands. JQL distills LLMs' annotation capabilities into lightweight annotators based on pretrained multilingual embeddings. These models exhibit robust multilingual and cross-lingual performance, even for languages and scripts unseen during training. Evaluated empirically across 35 languages, the resulting annotation pipeline substantially outperforms current heuristic filtering methods like Fineweb2. JQL notably enhances downstream model training quality and increases data retention rates. Our research provides practical insights and valuable resources for multilingual data curation, raising the standards of multilingual dataset development.

  Speculative decoding and quantization effectively accelerate memory-bound inference of large language models. Speculative decoding mitigates the memory bandwidth bottleneck by verifying multiple tokens within a single forward pass, which increases computational effort. Quantization achieves this optimization by compressing weights and activations into lower bit-widths and also reduces computations via low-bit matrix multiplications. To further leverage their strengths, we investigate the integration of these two techniques. Surprisingly, experiments applying the advanced speculative decoding method EAGLE-2 to various quantized models reveal that the memory benefits from 4-bit weight quantization are diminished by the computational load from speculative decoding. Specifically, verifying a tree-style draft incurs significantly more time overhead than a single-token forward pass on 4-bit weight quantized models. This finding led to our new speculative decoding design: a hierarchical framework that employs a small model as an intermediate stage to turn tree-style drafts into sequence drafts, leveraging the memory access benefits of the target quantized model. Experimental results show that our hierarchical approach achieves a 2.78$\times$ speedup across various tasks for the 4-bit weight Llama-3-70B model on an A100 GPU, outperforming EAGLE-2 by 1.31$\times$.

  Text-to-SQL aims to translate natural language queries into SQL statements, which is practical as it enables anyone to easily retrieve the desired information from databases. Recently, many existing approaches tackle this problem with Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging their strong capability in understanding user queries and generating corresponding SQL code. Yet, the parametric knowledge in LLMs might be limited to covering all the diverse and domain-specific queries that require grounding in various database schemas, which makes generated SQLs less accurate oftentimes. To tackle this, we propose constructing the knowledge base for text-to-SQL, a foundational source of knowledge, from which we retrieve and generate the necessary knowledge for given queries. In particular, unlike existing approaches that either manually annotate knowledge or generate only a few pieces of knowledge for each query, our knowledge base is comprehensive, which is constructed based on a combination of all the available questions and their associated database schemas along with their relevant knowledge, and can be reused for unseen databases from different datasets and domains. We validate our approach on multiple text-to-SQL datasets, considering both the overlapping and non-overlapping database scenarios, where it outperforms relevant baselines substantially.

  The persistent accumulation of unresolved legal cases, especially within the Indian judiciary, significantly hampers the timely delivery of justice. Manual methods of prioritizing petitions are often prone to inefficiencies and subjective biases further exacerbating delays. To address this issue, we propose LLMPR (Large Language Model-based Petition Ranking), an automated framework that utilizes transfer learning and machine learning to assign priority rankings to legal petitions based on their contextual urgency. Leveraging the ILDC dataset comprising 7,593 annotated petitions, we process unstructured legal text and extract features through various embedding techniques, including DistilBERT, LegalBERT, and MiniLM. These textual embeddings are combined with quantitative indicators such as gap days, rank scores, and word counts to train multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Our experiments demonstrate that Random Forest and Decision Tree models yield superior performance, with accuracy exceeding 99% and a Spearman rank correlation of 0.99. Notably, models using only numerical features achieve nearly optimal ranking results (R2 = 0.988, \r{ho} = 0.998), while LLM-based embeddings offer only marginal gains. These findings suggest that automated petition ranking can effectively streamline judicial workflows, reduce case backlog, and improve fairness in legal prioritization.

  Large language models like GPT, LLAMA, and Claude have become incredibly powerful at generating text, but they are still black boxes, so it is hard to understand how they decide what to say. That lack of transparency can be problematic, especially in fields where trust and accountability matter. To help with this, we introduce SMILE, a new method that explains how these models respond to different parts of a prompt. SMILE is model-agnostic and works by slightly changing the input, measuring how the output changes, and then highlighting which words had the most impact. Create simple visual heat maps showing which parts of a prompt matter the most. We tested SMILE on several leading LLMs and used metrics such as accuracy, consistency, stability, and fidelity to show that it gives clear and reliable explanations. By making these models easier to understand, SMILE brings us one step closer to making AI more transparent and trustworthy.

  Autoregressive models have become the de facto choice for sequence generation tasks, but standard approaches treat digits as independent tokens and apply cross-entropy loss, overlooking the coherent structure of numerical sequences. This paper introduces Numerical Token Integrity Loss (NTIL) to address this gap. NTIL operates at two levels: (1) token-level, where it extends the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to preserve ordinal relationships between numerical values, and (2) sequence-level, where it penalizes the overall discrepancy between the predicted and actual sequences. This dual approach improves numerical prediction and integrates effectively with LLMs/MLLMs. Extensive experiments show significant performance improvements with NTIL.

  Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for complex reasoning and decision-making tasks, where each intermediate step plays an important role in the reasoning process. Since language models are prone to various types of errors during the reasoning process, PRMs are required to possess nuanced capabilities for detecting various implicit error types in real-world scenarios. However, current benchmarks primarily focus on step correctness, failing to evaluate PRMs' performance systematically. To address this gap, we introduce PRMBench, a process-level benchmark specifically designed to assess the fine-grained error detection capabilities of PRMs. PRMBench comprises 6,216 carefully designed problems and 83,456 step-level labels, evaluating models across multiple dimensions, including simplicity, soundness, and sensitivity. In our experiments on 15 models, spanning both open-source PRMs and closed-source large language models prompted as critic models, we uncover significant weaknesses in current PRMs. These findings underscore the challenges inherent in process-level evaluation and highlight key directions for future research. We hope PRMBench can be a robust bench for advancing research on PRM evaluation and development.

  Model collapse in synthetic data indicates that iterative training on self-generated data leads to a gradual decline in performance. With the proliferation of AI models, synthetic data will fundamentally reshape the web data ecosystem. Future GPT-$\{n\}$ models will inevitably be trained on a blend of synthetic and human-produced data. In this paper, we focus on two questions: what is the impact of synthetic data on language model training, and how to synthesize data without model collapse? We first pre-train language models across different proportions of synthetic data, revealing a negative correlation between the proportion of synthetic data and model performance. We further conduct statistical analysis on synthetic data to uncover distributional shift phenomenon and over-concentration of n-gram features. Inspired by the above findings, we propose token editing on human-produced data to obtain semi-synthetic data. As a proof of concept, we theoretically demonstrate that token-level editing can prevent model collapse, as the test error is constrained by a finite upper bound. We conduct extensive experiments on pre-training from scratch, continual pre-training, and supervised fine-tuning. The results validate our theoretical proof that token-level editing improves model performance.

However, LLM-based agents face substantial challenges when deployed in novel environments or required to navigate unconventional action spaces. To empower agents to autonomously explore environments, optimize workflows, and enhance their understanding of actions, we propose SynWorld, a framework that allows agents to synthesize possible scenarios with multi-step action invocation within the action space and perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) exploration to effectively refine their action knowledge in the current environment. Our experiments demonstrate that SynWorld is an effective and general approach to learning action knowledge in new environments. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Improving Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the post-training stage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL). However, these supervised methods require expensive and manually annotated multi-modal data--an ultimately unsustainable resource. While recent efforts have explored unsupervised post-training, their methods are complex and difficult to iterate. In this work, we are the first to investigate the use of GRPO, a stable and scalable online RL algorithm, for enabling continual self-improvement without any external supervision. We propose MM-UPT, a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised post-training of MLLMs. MM-UPT builds upon GRPO, replacing traditional reward signals with a self-rewarding mechanism based on majority voting over multiple sampled responses. Our experiments demonstrate that MM-UPT significantly improves the reasoning ability of Qwen2.5-VL-7B (e.g., 66.3 %$\rightarrow$72.9 % on MathVista, 62.9 %$\rightarrow$68.7 % on We-Math), using standard dataset without ground truth labels. MM-UPT also outperforms prior unsupervised baselines and even approaches the results of supervised GRPO. Furthermore, we show that incorporating synthetic questions, generated solely by MLLM itself, can boost performance as well, highlighting a promising approach for scalable self-improvement. Overall, MM-UPT offers a new paradigm for continual, autonomous enhancement of MLLMs in the absence of external supervision. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities, with reinforcement learning (RL) playing a crucial role in this progress. While "aha moment" patterns--where models exhibit self-correction through reflection--are often attributed to emergent properties from RL, we first demonstrate that these patterns exist in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) prior to RL training but may not necessarily correlate with improved reasoning performance. Building on these insights, we present a comprehensive study on enhancing multimodal reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start with structured chain-of-thought reasoning patterns, followed by (2) reinforcement learning via GRPO to further refine these capabilities. Our extensive experiments show that this combined approach consistently outperforms both SFT-only and RL-only methods across challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks. The resulting models achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs at both 3B and 7B scales, with our 7B model showing substantial improvements over base models (e.g., 66.3 %$\rightarrow$73.4 % on MathVista, 62.9 %$\rightarrow$70.4 % on We-Math) and our 3B model achieving performance competitive with several 7B models. Overall, this work provides practical guidance for building advanced multimodal reasoning models. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable, but the mechanisms of their thinking and decision-making process remain unclear. Chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) have been commonly utilized to monitor LLMs, but this strategy fails to accurately reflect LLMs' thinking process. Techniques based on LLMs' hidden representations provide an inner perspective to monitor their latent thinking. However, previous methods only try to develop external monitors instead of making LLMs themselves easier to monitor. In this paper, we propose a novel method TELLME, improving the transparency of LLMs and helping monitors identify unsuitable and sensitive behaviors. Furthermore, we showcase the applications of TELLME on trustworthiness tasks (\eg, safety risks monitoring tasks and detoxification tasks), where LLMs achieve consistent improvement in transparency and task performance. More crucially, we theoretically analyze the improvement of TELLME on LLMs' generalization ability through optimal transport theory.

  Test-time compute has empowered multimodal large language models to generate extended reasoning chains, yielding strong performance on tasks such as multimodal math reasoning. However, this improved reasoning ability often comes with increased hallucination: as generations become longer, models tend to drift away from image-grounded content and rely more heavily on language priors. Attention analysis shows that longer reasoning chains lead to reduced focus on visual inputs, which contributes to hallucination. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce RH-AUC, a metric that quantifies how a model's perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, allowing us to evaluate whether the model preserves visual grounding during reasoning. We also release RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark that spans a variety of multimodal tasks, designed to assess the trade-off between reasoning ability and hallucination. Our analysis reveals that (i) larger models typically achieve a better balance between reasoning and perception, and (ii) this balance is influenced more by the types and domains of training data than by its overall volume. These findings underscore the importance of evaluation frameworks that jointly consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity.

  A common approach for teaching large language models (LLMs) to reason is to train on chain-of-thought (CoT) traces of in-distribution reasoning problems, but such annotated data is costly to obtain for every problem of interest. We want reasoning models to generalize beyond their training distribution, and ideally to generalize compositionally: combine atomic reasoning skills to solve harder, unseen reasoning tasks. We take a step towards compositional generalization of reasoning skills when addressing a target compositional task that has no labeled CoT data. We find that simply training models on CoT data of atomic tasks leads to limited generalization, but minimally modifying CoT formats of constituent atomic tasks to be composable can lead to improvements. We can train "atomic CoT" models on the atomic tasks with Composable CoT data and combine them with multitask learning or model merging for better zero-shot performance on the target compositional task. Such a combined model can be further bootstrapped on a small amount of compositional data using rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT). Results on string operations and natural language skill compositions show that training LLMs on Composable CoT outperforms multitask learning and continued fine-tuning baselines within a given training data budget.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Fusion Steering, an activation steering methodology that improves factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs) for question-answering (QA) tasks. This approach introduces flexible steering configurations, including full-layer steering and segmented steering. Unlike traditional methods constrained to single-layer or fixed-layer operations, Fusion Steering employs dynamic injection of prompt-specific activation deltas across all transformer layers. These activation deltas are derived from reference completions that combine the ground-truth answer with a model-generated explanation to facilitate semantically enriched, example-specific steering. The injection weights are optimized per prompt using Optuna, targeting a joint objective that balances token overlap (factual alignment) and perplexity (fluency proxy). Evaluation employs a composite score integrating token overlap and LLM-graded quality, encompassing factual accuracy, coherence, and relevance. Empirical results on 260 SimpleQA prompts (selected from 500 where the baseline failed) showcase the efficacy of segmented steering. Using Gemma-2-2B-IT with 8-bit quantization, segmented steering achieves an accuracy of 25.4% (outputs scoring $\geq 0.6$), outperforming the baseline at 3.5% and full-layer steering at 16.2%. Under the stricter SimpleQA rubric, segmented steering boosts fully correct responses from 0.0% to 13.1%. These findings highlight the strengths of segmented, dynamic intervention strategies and the promise of per-prompt, full-network activation control. Fusion Steering is also amenable to sparse representations, such as Neuronpedia or sparse crosscoders, suggesting a promising direction for interpretable and scalable activation-level control in LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Social media platforms have experienced a significant rise in toxic content, including abusive language and discriminatory remarks, presenting growing challenges for content moderation. Some users evade censorship by deliberately disguising toxic words through homophonic cloak, which necessitates the task of unveiling cloaked toxicity. Existing methods are mostly designed for English texts, while Chinese cloaked toxicity unveiling has not been solved yet. To tackle the issue, we propose C$^2$TU, a novel training-free and prompt-free method for Chinese cloaked toxic content unveiling. It first employs substring matching to identify candidate toxic words based on Chinese homo-graph and toxic lexicon. Then it filters those candidates that are non-toxic and corrects cloaks to be their corresponding toxicities. Specifically, we develop two model variants for filtering, which are based on BERT and LLMs, respectively. For LLMs, we address the auto-regressive limitation in computing word occurrence probability and utilize the full semantic contexts of a text sequence to reveal cloaked toxic words. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C$^2$TU can achieve superior performance on two Chinese toxic datasets. In particular, our method outperforms the best competitor by up to 71% on the F1 score and 35% on accuracy, respectively.

  Pursuit of accessible legal assistance in India faces a critical gap, as many citizens struggle to leverage their legal rights due to limited awareness and access to relevant legal information. This paper introduces Legal Assist AI, a transformer-based model designed to bridge this gap by offering effective legal assistance through large language models (LLMs). The system retrieves relevant legal information from a curated database and generates accurate responses, enabling effective assistance for diverse users, including legal professionals, scholars, and the general public. The model was fine-tuned on extensive datasets from the Indian legal domain, including Indian Constitution, Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and so forth, providing a robust understanding of the complexities of Indian law. By incorporating domain-specific legal datasets, the proposed model demonstrated remarkable efficiency and specialization in legal Question-Answering. The model was evaluated against state-of-the-art models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo and Mistral 7B, achieving a 60.08% score on the AIBE, outperforming its competitors in legal reasoning and accuracy. Unlike other models, Legal Assist AI avoided common issues such as hallucinations, making it highly reliable for practical legal applications. It showcases the model's applicability in real-world legal scenarios, with future iterations aiming to enhance performance and expand its dataset to cover a broader range of multilingual and case-specific queries as well.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks. To further tailor LLMs to specific domains or applications, post-training techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Preference Learning, and model merging are commonly employed. While each of these methods has been extensively studied in isolation, the automated construction of complete post-training pipelines remains an underexplored area. Existing approaches typically rely on manual design or focus narrowly on optimizing individual components, such as data ordering or merging strategies. In this work, we introduce LaMDAgent (short for Language Model Developing Agent), a novel framework that autonomously constructs and optimizes full post-training pipelines through the use of LLM-based agents. LaMDAgent systematically explores diverse model generation techniques, datasets, and hyperparameter configurations, leveraging task-based feedback to discover high-performing pipelines with minimal human intervention. Our experiments show that LaMDAgent improves tool-use accuracy by 9.0 points while preserving instruction-following capabilities. Moreover, it uncovers effective post-training strategies that are often overlooked by conventional human-driven exploration. We further analyze the impact of data and model size scaling to reduce computational costs on the exploration, finding that model size scalings introduces new challenges, whereas scaling data size enables cost-effective pipeline discovery.

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) generally enhances large language models' (LLMs) ability to solve knowledge-intensive tasks. But RAG may also lead to performance degradation due to imperfect retrieval and the model's limited ability to leverage retrieved content. In this work, we evaluate the robustness of LLMs in practical RAG setups (henceforth retrieval robustness). We focus on three research questions: (1) whether RAG is always better than non-RAG; (2) whether more retrieved documents always lead to better performance; (3) and whether document orders impact results. To facilitate this study, we establish a benchmark of 1500 open-domain questions, each with retrieved documents from Wikipedia. We introduce three robustness metrics, each corresponds to one research question. Our comprehensive experiments, involving 11 LLMs and 3 prompting strategies, reveal that all of these LLMs exhibit surprisingly high retrieval robustness; nonetheless, different degrees of imperfect robustness hinders them from fully utilizing the benefits of RAG.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs can be unpredictable, as even slight alterations to the prompt can cause the output to change in unexpected ways. Thus, the ability of models to accurately explain their behavior is critical, especially in high-stakes settings. One approach for evaluating explanations is counterfactual simulatability, how well an explanation allows users to infer the model's output on related counterfactuals. Counterfactual simulatability has been previously studied for yes/no question answering tasks. We provide a general framework for extending this method to generation tasks, using news summarization and medical suggestion as example use cases. We find that while LLM explanations do enable users to better predict LLM outputs on counterfactuals in the summarization setting, there is significant room for improvement for medical suggestion. Furthermore, our results suggest that the evaluation for counterfactual simulatability may be more appropriate for skill-based tasks as opposed to knowledge-based tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Investigating outliers in large language models (LLMs) is crucial due to their significant impact on various aspects of LLM performance, including quantization and compression. Outliers often cause considerable quantization errors, leading to degraded model performance. Identifying and addressing these outliers can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the quantization process, enabling smoother deployment on edge devices or specialized hardware. Recent studies have identified two common types of outliers in LLMs: massive activations and channel-wise outliers. While numerous quantization algorithms have been proposed to mitigate their effects and maintain satisfactory accuracy, few have thoroughly explored the root causes of these outliers in depth. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the formation mechanisms of these outliers and propose potential strategies to mitigate their occurrence. Ultimately, we introduce some efficient approaches to eliminate most massive activations and channel-wise outliers with minimal impact on accuracy.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in knowledge-intensive tasks, while they remain vulnerable when encountering misinformation. Existing studies have explored the role of LLMs in combating misinformation, but there is still a lack of fine-grained analysis on the specific aspects and extent to which LLMs are influenced by misinformation. To bridge this gap, we present MisBench, the current largest and most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' behavior and knowledge preference toward misinformation. MisBench consists of 10,346,712 pieces of misinformation, which uniquely considers both knowledge-based conflicts and stylistic variations in misinformation. Empirical results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate comparable abilities in discerning misinformation, they still remain susceptible to knowledge conflicts and stylistic variations. Based on these findings, we further propose a novel approach called Reconstruct to Discriminate (RtD) to strengthen LLMs' ability to detect misinformation. Our study provides valuable insights into LLMs' interactions with misinformation, and we believe MisBench can serve as an effective benchmark for evaluating LLM-based detectors and enhancing their reliability in real-world applications.

  In this paper, we address the task of targeted sentiment analysis (TSA), which involves two sub-tasks, i.e., identifying specific aspects from reviews and determining their corresponding sentiments. Aspect extraction forms the foundation for sentiment prediction, highlighting the critical dependency between these two tasks for effective cross-task knowledge transfer. While most existing studies adopt a multi-task learning paradigm to align task-specific features in the latent space, they predominantly rely on coarse-grained knowledge transfer. Such approaches lack fine-grained control over aspect-sentiment relationships, often assuming uniform sentiment polarity within related aspects. This oversimplification neglects contextual cues that differentiate sentiments, leading to negative transfer. To overcome these limitations, we propose FCKT, a fine-grained cross-task knowledge transfer framework tailored for TSA. By explicitly incorporating aspect-level information into sentiment prediction, FCKT achieves fine-grained knowledge transfer, effectively mitigating negative transfer and enhancing task performance. Experiments on three datasets, including comparisons with various baselines and large language models (LLMs), demonstrate the effectiveness of FCKT. The source code is available onthis https URL.

  Faithfulness hallucination are claims generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) not supported by contexts provided to the LLM. Lacking assessment standard, existing benchmarks only contain "factual statements" that rephrase source materials without marking "cognitive statements" that make inference from the given context, making the consistency evaluation and optimization of cognitive statements difficult. Inspired by how an evidence is assessed in the legislative domain, we design a rigorous framework to assess different levels of faithfulness of cognitive statements and create a benchmark dataset where we reveal insightful statistics. We design an annotation pipeline to create larger benchmarks for different LLMs automatically, and the resulting larger-scale CogniBench-L dataset can be used to train accurate cognitive hallucination detection model.

  With approximately 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, current large language models (LLMs) support only a small subset. Prior research indicates LLMs can learn new languages for certain tasks without supervised data. We extend this investigation to speech recognition, investigating whether LLMs can learn unseen, low-resource languages through in-context learning (ICL). With experiments on four diverse endangered languages that LLMs have not been trained on, we find that providing more relevant text samples enhances performance in both language modelling and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks. Furthermore, we show that the probability-based approach outperforms the traditional instruction-based approach in language learning. Lastly, we show ICL enables LLMs to achieve ASR performance that is comparable to or even surpasses dedicated language models trained specifically for these languages, while preserving the original capabilities of the LLMs.

  Aligning large language models with human feedback at inference time has received increasing attention due to its flexibility. Existing methods rely on generating multiple responses from the base policy for search using a reward model, which can be considered as searching in a discrete response space. However, these methods struggle to explore informative candidates when the base policy is weak or the candidate set is small, resulting in limited effectiveness. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose Simple Energy Adaptation ($\textbf{SEA}$), a simple yet effective algorithm for inference-time alignment. In contrast to expensive search over the discrete space, SEA directly adapts original responses from the base policy toward the optimal one via gradient-based sampling in continuous latent space. Specifically, SEA formulates inference as an iterative optimization procedure on an energy function over actions in the continuous space defined by the optimal policy, enabling simple and effective alignment. For instance, despite its simplicity, SEA outperforms the second-best baseline with a relative improvement of up to $ \textbf{77.51%}$ on AdvBench and $\textbf{16.36%}$ on MATH.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on reasoning-intensive tasks, but enhancing their reasoning abilities typically relies on either reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable signals or supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) demonstrations, both of which are expensive. In this paper, we study a novel problem of incentivizing the reasoning capacity of LLMs without expensive high-quality demonstrations and reinforcement learning. We investigate whether the reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be effectively incentivized via supervision from significantly weaker models. We further analyze when and why such weak supervision succeeds in eliciting reasoning abilities in stronger models. Our findings show that supervision from significantly weaker reasoners can substantially improve student reasoning performance, recovering close to 94% of the gains of expensive RL at a fraction of the cost. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures demonstrate that weak reasoners can effectively incentivize reasoning in stronger student models, consistently improving performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Our results suggest that this simple weak-to-strong paradigm is a promising and generalizable alternative to costly methods for incentivizing strong reasoning capabilities at inference-time in LLMs. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  As online platforms grow, comment sections increasingly host harassment that undermines user experience and well-being. This study benchmarks three leading large language models, OpenAI GPT-4.1, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Anthropic Claude 3 Opus, on a corpus of 5,080 YouTube comments sampled from high-abuse threads in gaming, lifestyle, food vlog, and music channels. The dataset comprises 1,334 harmful and 3,746 non-harmful messages in English, Arabic, and Indonesian, annotated independently by two reviewers with substantial agreement (Cohen's kappa = 0.83). Using a unified prompt and deterministic settings, GPT-4.1 achieved the best overall balance with an F1 score of 0.863, precision of 0.887, and recall of 0.841. Gemini flagged the highest share of harmful posts (recall = 0.875) but its precision fell to 0.767 due to frequent false positives. Claude delivered the highest precision at 0.920 and the lowest false-positive rate of 0.022, yet its recall dropped to 0.720. Qualitative analysis showed that all three models struggle with sarcasm, coded insults, and mixed-language slang. These results underscore the need for moderation pipelines that combine complementary models, incorporate conversational context, and fine-tune for under-represented languages and implicit abuse. A de-identified version of the dataset and full prompts is publicly released to promote reproducibility and further progress in automated content moderation.

  Aligning general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks often incurs significant training adjustment costs. Prior research has explored various avenues to enhance alignment efficiency, primarily through minimal-data training or data-driven activations to identify key attention heads. However, these approaches inherently introduce data dependency, which hinders generalization and reusability. To address this issue and enhance model alignment efficiency, we propose the \textit{\textbf{A}ttention \textbf{L}ocalization and \textbf{P}runing \textbf{S}trategy (\textbf{ALPS})}, an efficient algorithm that localizes the most task-sensitive attention heads and prunes by restricting attention training updates to these heads, thereby reducing alignment costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method activates only \textbf{10\%} of attention parameters during fine-tuning while achieving a \textbf{2\%} performance improvement over baselines on three tasks. Moreover, the identified task-specific heads are transferable across datasets and mitigate knowledge forgetting. Our work and findings provide a novel perspective on efficient LLM alignment.

  In standard autoregressive generation, an LLM predicts the next-token distribution, samples a discrete token, and then discards the distribution, passing only the sampled token as new input. To preserve this distribution's rich information, we propose Mixture of Inputs (MoI), a training-free method for autoregressive generation. After generating a token following the standard paradigm, we construct a new input that blends the generated discrete token with the previously discarded token distribution. Specifically, we employ a Bayesian estimation method that treats the token distribution as the prior, the sampled token as the observation, and replaces the conventional one-hot vector with the continuous posterior expectation as the new model input. MoI allows the model to maintain a richer internal representation throughout the generation process, resulting in improved text quality and reasoning capabilities. On mathematical reasoning, code generation, and PhD-level QA tasks, MoI consistently improves performance across multiple models including QwQ-32B, Nemotron-Super-49B, Gemma-3-27B, and DAPO-Qwen-32B, with no additional training and negligible computational overhead.

  Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities but are inherently limited by their knowledge reservoir. Retrieval-augmented reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information, hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new ``search-and-refine-during-think'' paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  How do the latent spaces used by independently-trained LLMs relate to one another? We study the nearest neighbor relationships induced by activations at different layers of 24 open-weight LLMs, and find that they 1) tend to vary from layer to layer within a model, and 2) are approximately shared between corresponding layers of different models. Claim 2 shows that these nearest neighbor relationships are not arbitrary, as they are shared across models, but Claim 1 shows that they are not "obvious" either, as there is no single set of nearest neighbor relationships that is universally shared. Together, these suggest that LLMs generate a progression of activation geometries from layer to layer, but that this entire progression is largely shared between models, stretched and squeezed to fit into different architectures.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A full understanding of the behavior of a large language model (LLM) requires our understanding of its input token space. If this space differs from our assumptions, our understanding of and conclusions about the LLM will likely be flawed. We elucidate the structure of the token embeddings both empirically and theoretically. We present a novel statistical test assuming that the neighborhood around each token has a relatively flat and smooth structure as the null hypothesis. Failing to reject the null is uninformative, but rejecting it at a specific token $\psi$ implies an irregularity in the token subspace in a $\psi$-neighborhood, $B(\psi)$. The structure assumed in the null is a generalization of a manifold with boundary called a \emph{smooth fiber bundle} (which can be split into two spatial regimes -- small and large radius), so we denote our new hypothesis test as the ``fiber bundle hypothesis.'' Failure to reject the null hypothesis is uninformative, but rejecting it at $\psi$ indicates a statistically significant irregularity at $B(\psi)$. By running our test over several open-source LLMs, each with unique token embeddings, we find that the null is frequently rejected, and so the evidence suggests that the token subspace is not a fiber bundle and hence also not a manifold. As a consequence of our findings, when an LLM is presented with two semantically equivalent prompts, if one prompt contains a token implicated by our test, the response to that prompt will likely exhibit less stability than the other.

We introduce LINGOLY-TOO, a challenging reasoning benchmark grounded in natural language and designed to counteract the effect of non-reasoning abilities on reasoning estimates. Using linguistically informed rulesets, we permute reasoning problems written in real languages to generate numerous question variations. These permutations preserve the intrinsic reasoning steps required for each solution while reducing the likelihood problems are directly solvable with models' knowledge. Experiments and analyses show that models can circumvent reasoning and answer from prior knowledge. On a metric that rewards consistent reasoning, all models perform poorly and exhibit high variance across question permutations, indicating that Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning faculty remains brittle. Overall, results on the benchmark reflect the recent progress of Inference-Time Compute (ITC) models but suggest ample room for further improvement. The benchmark is a step towards better measurement of reasoning abilities of LLMs and offers a cautionary tale on the importance of disentangling reasoning abilities from models' internalised knowledge when developing reasoning benchmarks.

  Answering complex, long-context questions remains a major challenge for large language models (LLMs) as it requires effective question clarifications and context retrieval. We propose Agentic Long-Context Understanding (AgenticLU), a framework designed to enhance an LLM's understanding of such queries by integrating targeted self-clarification with contextual grounding within an agentic workflow. At the core of AgenticLU is Chain-of-Clarifications (CoC), where models refine their understanding through self-generated clarification questions and corresponding contextual groundings. By scaling inference as a tree search where each node represents a CoC step, we achieve 97.8% answer recall on NarrativeQA with a search depth of up to three and a branching factor of eight. To amortize the high cost of this search process to training, we leverage the preference pairs for each step obtained by the CoC workflow and perform two-stage model finetuning: (1) supervised finetuning to learn effective decomposition strategies, and (2) direct preference optimization to enhance reasoning quality. This enables AgenticLU models to generate clarifications and retrieve relevant context effectively and efficiently in a single inference pass. Extensive experiments across seven long-context tasks demonstrate that AgenticLU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompting methods and specialized long-context LLMs, achieving robust multi-hop reasoning while sustaining consistent performance as context length grows.

  ``Socrates is human. All humans are mortal. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.'' This form of argument illustrates a typical pattern of two-hop reasoning. Formally, two-hop reasoning refers to the process of inferring a conclusion by making two logical steps, each connecting adjacent concepts, such that the final conclusion depends on the integration of both steps. It is one of the most fundamental components of human reasoning and plays a crucial role in both formal logic and everyday decision-making. Despite recent progress in large language models (LLMs), we surprisingly find that they can fail at solving simple two-hop reasoning problems when distractors are present. We observe on a synthetic dataset that pre-trained LLMs often resort to random guessing among all plausible conclusions. However, after few steps of fine-tuning, models achieve near-perfect accuracy and exhibit strong length generalization. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we train a 3-layer Transformer from scratch on a synthetic two-hop reasoning task and reverse-engineer its internal information flow. We observe a clear progression in the attention logits throughout training. This pictures a sharp phase transition from an initial stage of random guessing to the emergence of a structured sequential query mechanism, where the model first retrieves the preceding and the bridge concepts in the early layers and then uses them to infer the final answer. Finally, we show that these dynamics can be captured by a minimal three-parameter attention-only network.

  Role-playing language agents (RPLAs) have emerged as promising applications of large language models (LLMs). However, simulating established characters presents a challenging task for RPLAs, due to the lack of authentic character datasets and nuanced evaluation methods using such data. In this paper, we present CoSER, a collection of a high-quality dataset, open models, and an evaluation protocol towards effective RPLAs of established characters. The CoSER dataset covers 17,966 characters from 771 renowned books. It provides authentic dialogues with real-world intricacies, as well as diverse data types such as conversation setups, character experiences and internal thoughts. Drawing from acting methodology, we introduce given-circumstance acting for training and evaluating role-playing LLMs, where LLMs sequentially portray multiple characters in book scenes. Using our dataset, we develop CoSER 8B and CoSER 70B, i.e., advanced open role-playing LLMs built on LLaMA-3.1 models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the value of the CoSER dataset for RPLA training, evaluation and retrieval. Moreover, CoSER 70B exhibits state-of-the-art performance surpassing or matching GPT-4o on our evaluation and three existing benchmarks, i.e., achieving 75.80% and 93.47% accuracy on the InCharacter and LifeChoice benchmarks respectively.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded remarkably in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities remain a fundamental challenge. While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, their ability to perform complex reasoning-spanning logical deduction, mathematical problem-solving, commonsense inference, and multi-step reasoning-often falls short of human expectations. This survey provides a comprehensive review of emerging techniques enhancing reasoning in LLMs. We categorize existing methods into key approaches, including prompting strategies (e.g., Chain-of-Thought reasoning, Self-Consistency, and Tree-of-Thought reasoning), architectural innovations (e.g., retrieval-augmented models, modular reasoning networks, and neuro-symbolic integration), and learning paradigms (e.g., fine-tuning with reasoning-specific datasets, reinforcement learning, and self-supervised reasoning objectives). Additionally, we explore evaluation frameworks used to assess reasoning in LLMs and highlight open challenges, such as hallucinations, robustness, and reasoning generalization across diverse tasks. By synthesizing recent advancements, this survey aims to provide insights into promising directions for future research and practical applications of reasoning-augmented LLMs.

  This paper introduces a checks-and-balances framework for ethical alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs), inspired by three-branch governmental systems. It implements three independent yet interacting components: LLMs as the executive branch for knowledge generation, DIKE as the legislative branch establishing ethical guardrails, and ERIS as the judicial branch for contextual interpretation. Beyond structural separation, we address a fundamental challenge: regulating emotion to shape behaviors. Drawing from psychological theories where managing emotional responses prevents harmful behaviors, we develop a self-supervised learning pipeline that maps emotions to linguistic behaviors, enabling precise behavioral modulation through emotional conditioning. By integrating this approach with adversarial testing, our framework demonstrates how DIKE and ERIS direct linguistic behaviors toward ethical outcomes while preserving independence throughout knowledge generation, ethical oversight, and contextual interpretation.

  With the rapid iteration of Multi-modality Large Language Models (MLLMs) and the evolving demands of the field, the number of benchmarks produced annually has surged into the hundreds. The rapid growth has inevitably led to significant redundancy among benchmarks. Therefore, it is crucial to take a step back and critically assess the current state of redundancy and propose targeted principles for constructing effective MLLM benchmarks. In this paper, we focus on redundancy from three key perspectives: 1) Redundancy of benchmark capability dimensions, 2) Redundancy in the number of test questions, and 3) Cross-benchmark redundancy within specific domains. Through the comprehensive analysis over hundreds of MLLMs' performance across more than 20 benchmarks, we aim to quantitatively measure the level of redundancy lies in existing MLLM evaluations, provide valuable insights to guide the future development of MLLM benchmarks, and offer strategies to refine and address redundancy issues effectively.

  Positional bias in large language models (LLMs) hinders their ability to effectively process long inputs. A prominent example is the "lost in the middle" phenomenon, where LLMs struggle to utilize relevant information situated in the middle of the input. While prior research primarily focuses on single pieces of relevant information, real-world applications often involve multiple relevant information pieces. To bridge this gap, we present LongPiBench, a benchmark designed to assess positional bias involving multiple pieces of relevant information. Thorough experiments are conducted with five commercial and six open-source models. These experiments reveal that while most current models are robust against the "lost in the middle" issue, there exist significant biases related to the spacing of relevant information pieces. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating and reducing positional biases to advance LLM's capabilities.

  As large language models (LLMs) become an important way of information access, there have been increasing concerns that LLMs may intensify the spread of unethical content, including implicit bias that hurts certain populations without explicit harmful words. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs' implicit bias towards certain demographics by attacking them from a psychometric perspective to elicit agreements to biased viewpoints. Inspired by psychometric principles in cognitive and social psychology, we propose three attack approaches, i.e., Disguise, Deception, and Teaching. Incorporating the corresponding attack instructions, we built two benchmarks: (1) a bilingual dataset with biased statements covering four bias types (2.7K instances) for extensive comparative analysis, and (2) BUMBLE, a larger benchmark spanning nine common bias types (12.7K instances) for comprehensive evaluation. Extensive evaluation of popular commercial and open-source LLMs shows that our methods can elicit LLMs' inner bias more effectively than competitive baselines. Our attack methodology and benchmarks offer an effective means of assessing the ethical risks of LLMs, driving progress toward greater accountability in their development.

  The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has traditionally relied on static benchmarks, a paradigm that poses two major limitations: (1) predefined test sets lack adaptability to diverse application domains, and (2) standardized evaluation protocols often fail to capture fine-grained assessments of domain-specific knowledge and contextual reasoning abilities. To overcome these challenges, we propose GuessArena, an adaptive evaluation framework grounded in adversarial game-based interactions. Inspired by the interactive structure of the Guess Who I Am? game, our framework seamlessly integrates dynamic domain knowledge modeling with progressive reasoning assessment to improve evaluation fidelity. Empirical studies across five vertical domains-finance, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology, and education-demonstrate that GuessArena effectively distinguishes LLMs in terms of domain knowledge coverage and reasoning chain completeness. Compared to conventional benchmarks, our method provides substantial advantages in interpretability, scalability, and scenario adaptability.

  Recent studies on post-training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning through reinforcement learning (RL) typically focus on tasks that can be accurately verified and rewarded, such as solving math problems. In contrast, our research investigates the impact of reward noise, a more practical consideration for real-world scenarios involving the post-training of LLMs using reward models. We found that LLMs demonstrate strong robustness to substantial reward noise. For example, manually flipping 40% of the reward function's outputs in math tasks still allows a Qwen-2.5-7B model to achieve rapid convergence, improving its performance on math tasks from 5% to 72%, compared to the 75% accuracy achieved by a model trained with noiseless rewards. Surprisingly, by only rewarding the appearance of key reasoning phrases (namely reasoning pattern reward, RPR), such as ``first, I need to''-without verifying the correctness of answers, the model achieved peak downstream performance (over 70% accuracy for Qwen-2.5-7B) comparable to models trained with strict correctness verification and accurate rewards. Recognizing the importance of the reasoning process over the final results, we combined RPR with noisy reward models. RPR helped calibrate the noisy reward models, mitigating potential false negatives and enhancing the LLM's performance on open-ended tasks. These findings suggest the importance of improving models' foundational abilities during the pre-training phase while providing insights for advancing post-training techniques.

  The widespread success of large language models (LLMs) on NLP benchmarks has been accompanied by concerns that LLMs function primarily as stochastic parrots that reproduce texts similar to what they saw during pre-training, often erroneously. But what is the nature of their errors, and do these errors exhibit any regularities? In this work, we examine irrelevant context hallucinations, in which models integrate misleading contextual cues into their predictions. Through behavioral analysis, we show that these errors result from a structured yet flawed mechanism that we term class-based (mis)generalization, in which models combine abstract class cues with features extracted from the query or context to derive answers. Furthermore, mechanistic interpretability experiments on Llama-3, Mistral, and Pythia across 39 factual recall relation types reveal that this behavior is reflected in the model's internal computations: (i) abstract class representations are constructed in lower layers before being refined into specific answers in higher layers, (ii) feature selection is governed by two competing circuits -- one prioritizing direct query-based reasoning, the other incorporating contextual cues -- whose relative influences determine the final output. Our findings provide a more nuanced perspective on the stochastic parrot argument: through form-based training, LLMs can exhibit generalization leveraging abstractions, albeit in unreliable ways based on contextual cues -- what we term stochastic chameleons.

  Diffusion-based large language models (Diffusion LLMs) have shown promise for non-autoregressive text generation with parallel decoding capabilities. However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we propose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \textbf{27.6$\times$ throughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of Diffusion LLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) often acquire knowledge during pretraining that is undesirable in downstream deployments, e.g., sensitive information or copyrighted content. Existing approaches for removing such knowledge rely on fine-tuning, training low-rank adapters or fact-level editing, but these are either too coarse, too shallow, or ineffective. In this work, we propose PISCES (Precise In-parameter Suppression for Concept EraSure), a novel framework for precisely erasing entire concepts from model parameters by directly editing directions that encode them in parameter space. PISCES uses a disentangler model to decompose MLP vectors into interpretable features, identifies those associated with a target concept using automated interpretability techniques, and removes them from model parameters. Experiments on Gemma 2 and Llama 3.1 over various concepts show that PISCES achieves modest gains in efficacy over leading erasure methods, reducing accuracy on the target concept to as low as 7.7%, while dramatically improving erasure specificity (by up to 31%) and robustness (by up to 38%). Overall, these results demonstrate that feature-based in-parameter editing enables a more precise and reliable approach for removing conceptual knowledge in language models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continually expanding new languages for existing large language models (LLMs) is a promising yet challenging approach to building powerful multilingual LLMs. The biggest challenge is to make the model continuously learn new languages while preserving the proficient ability of old languages. To achieve this, recent work utilizes the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to expand new languages by adding new experts and avoid catastrophic forgetting of old languages by routing corresponding tokens to the original model backbone (old experts). Although intuitive, this kind of method is parameter-costly when expanding new languages and still inevitably impacts the performance of old languages. To address these limitations, we analyze the language characteristics of different layers in LLMs and propose a layer-wise expert allocation algorithm (LayerMoE) to determine the appropriate number of new experts for each layer. Specifically, we find different layers in LLMs exhibit different representation similarities between languages and then utilize the similarity as the indicator to allocate experts for each layer, i.e., the higher similarity, the fewer experts. Additionally, to further mitigate the forgetting of old languages, we add a classifier in front of the router network on the layers with higher similarity to guide the routing of old language tokens. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art baseline with 60% fewer experts in the single-expansion setting and with 33.3% fewer experts in the lifelong-expansion setting, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

  Emotion understanding includes basic tasks (e.g., sentiment/emotion classification) and advanced tasks (e.g., sarcasm/humor detection). Current methods rely on fixed-length CoT reasoning, failing to adapt to the varying complexity of emotions. We propose a task-adaptive reasoning framework that employs DeepSeek-R1 to generate variable-length reasoning chains for different emotion tasks. By combining fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, we design a composite reward function that balances four objectives: prediction accuracy, adaptive reasoning depth control, structural diversity in reasoning paths, and suppression of repetitive logic. This approach achieves dynamic context-sensitive inference while enabling LLMs to autonomously develop deep reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in both Acc and F1 scores across four tasks: emotion, sentiment, humor, and sarcasm. Notably, peak enhancements reached 3.56% F1 (2.76% Acc) for basic tasks and 37.95% F1 (23.14% Acc) for advanced tasks. Our work bridges rigid CoT reasoning and emotional complexity through adaptive-depth analysis.

  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of agentic information seeking capabilities through the integration of tools such as search engines and web browsers. However, current mainstream approaches for enabling LLM web search proficiency face significant challenges: supervised fine-tuning struggles with data production in open-search domains, while RL converges quickly, limiting their data utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose EvolveSearch, a novel iterative self-evolution framework that combines SFT and RL to enhance agentic web search capabilities without any external human-annotated reasoning data. Extensive experiments on seven multi-hop question-answering (MHQA) benchmarks demonstrate that EvolveSearch consistently improves performance across iterations, ultimately achieving an average improvement of 4.7\% over the current state-of-the-art across seven benchmarks, opening the door to self-evolution agentic capabilities in open web search domains.

  Robust evaluation is critical for deploying trustworthy retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, current LLM-based evaluation frameworks predominantly rely on directly prompting resource-intensive models with complex multi-stage prompts, underutilizing models' reasoning capabilities and introducing significant computational cost. In this paper, we present RAG-Zeval (RAG-Zero Evaluator), a novel end-to-end framework that formulates faithfulness and correctness evaluation as a rule-guided reasoning task. Our approach trains evaluators with reinforcement learning, facilitating compact models to generate comprehensive and sound assessments with detailed explanation in one-pass. We introduce a ranking-based outcome reward mechanism, using preference judgments rather than absolute scores, to address the challenge of obtaining precise pointwise reward signals. To this end, we synthesize the ranking references by generating quality-controlled responses with zero human annotation. Experiments demonstrate RAG-Zeval's superior performance, achieving the strongest correlation with human judgments and outperforming baselines that rely on LLMs with 10-100 times more parameters. Our approach also exhibits superior interpretability in response evaluation.

  This work presents Pangu Embedded, an efficient Large Language Model (LLM) reasoner developed on Ascend Neural Processing Units (NPUs), featuring flexible fast and slow thinking capabilities. Pangu Embedded addresses the significant computational costs and inference latency challenges prevalent in existing reasoning-optimized LLMs. We propose a two-stage training framework for its construction. In Stage 1, the model is finetuned via an iterative distillation process, incorporating inter-iteration model merging to effectively aggregate complementary knowledge. This is followed by reinforcement learning on Ascend clusters, optimized by a latency-tolerant scheduler that combines stale synchronous parallelism with prioritized data queues. The RL process is guided by a Multi-source Adaptive Reward System (MARS), which generates dynamic, task-specific reward signals using deterministic metrics and lightweight LLM evaluators for mathematics, coding, and general problem-solving tasks. Stage 2 introduces a dual-system framework, endowing Pangu Embedded with a "fast" mode for routine queries and a deeper "slow" mode for complex inference. This framework offers both manual mode switching for user control and an automatic, complexity-aware mode selection mechanism that dynamically allocates computational resources to balance latency and reasoning depth. Experimental results on benchmarks including AIME 2024, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench demonstrate that Pangu Embedded with 7B parameters, outperforms similar-size models like Qwen3-8B and GLM4-9B. It delivers rapid responses and state-of-the-art reasoning quality within a single, unified model architecture, highlighting a promising direction for developing powerful yet practically deployable LLM reasoners.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper examines how LLMs handle false presuppositions and whether certain linguistic factors influence their responses to falsely presupposed content. Presuppositions subtly introduce information as given, making them highly effective at embedding disputable or false information. This raises concerns about whether LLMs, like humans, may fail to detect and correct misleading assumptions introduced as false presuppositions, even when the stakes of misinformation are high. Using a systematic approach based on linguistic presupposition analysis, we investigate the conditions under which LLMs are more or less sensitive to adopt or reject false presuppositions. Focusing on political contexts, we examine how factors like linguistic construction, political party, and scenario probability impact the recognition of false presuppositions. We conduct experiments with a newly created dataset and examine three LLMs: OpenAI's GPT-4-o, Meta's LLama-3-8B, and MistralAI's Mistral-7B-v03. Our results show that the models struggle to recognize false presuppositions, with performance varying by condition. This study highlights that linguistic presupposition analysis is a valuable tool for uncovering the reinforcement of political misinformation in LLM responses.

  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive language capabilities but remain vulnerable to malicious prompts and jailbreaking attacks. Existing knowledge editing methods for LLM detoxification face two major challenges. First, they often rely on entity-specific localization, making them ineffective against adversarial inputs without explicit entities. Second, these methods suffer from over-editing, where detoxified models reject legitimate queries, compromising overall performance. In this paper, we propose ToxEdit, a toxicity-aware knowledge editing approach that dynamically detects toxic activation patterns during forward propagation. It then routes computations through adaptive inter-layer pathways to mitigate toxicity effectively. This design ensures precise toxicity mitigation while preserving LLMs' general capabilities. To more accurately assess over-editing, we also enhance the SafeEdit benchmark by incorporating instruction-following evaluation tasks. Experimental results on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our ToxEdit outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both detoxification performance and safeguarding general capabilities of LLMs.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in multilingual machine translation, sometimes even outperforming traditional neural systems. However, previous research has highlighted the challenges of using LLMs, particularly with prompt engineering, for low-resource languages. In this work, we introduce Fragment-Shot Prompting, a novel in-context learning method that segments input and retrieves translation examples based on syntactic coverage, along with Pivoted Fragment-Shot, an extension that enables translation without direct parallel data. We evaluate these methods using GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, o1-mini, LLaMA-3.3, and DeepSeek-R1 for translation between Italian and two Ladin variants, revealing three key findings: (1) Fragment-Shot Prompting is effective for translating into and between the studied low-resource languages, with syntactic coverage positively correlating with translation quality; (2) Models with stronger reasoning abilities make more effective use of retrieved knowledge, generally produce better translations, and enable Pivoted Fragment-Shot to significantly improve translation quality between the Ladin variants; and (3) prompt engineering offers limited, if any, improvements when translating from a low-resource to a high-resource language, where zero-shot prompting already yields satisfactory results. We publicly release our code and the retrieval corpora.

  Biomedical reasoning often requires traversing interconnected relationships across entities such as drugs, diseases, and proteins. Despite the increasing prominence of large language models (LLMs), existing benchmarks lack the ability to evaluate multi-hop reasoning in the biomedical domain, particularly for queries involving one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. This gap leaves the critical challenges of biomedical multi-hop reasoning underexplored. To address this, we introduce BioHopR, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate multi-hop, multi-answer reasoning in structured biomedical knowledge graphs. Built from the comprehensive PrimeKG, BioHopR includes 1-hop and 2-hop reasoning tasks that reflect real-world biomedical complexities.Evaluations of state-of-the-art models reveal that O3-mini, a proprietary reasoning-focused model, achieves 37.93% precision on 1-hop tasks and 14.57% on 2-hop tasks, outperforming proprietary models such as GPT4O and open-source biomedical models including HuatuoGPT-o1-70B and Llama-3.3-70B. However, all models exhibit significant declines in multi-hop performance, underscoring the challenges of resolving implicit reasoning steps in the biomedical domain. By addressing the lack of benchmarks for multi-hop reasoning in biomedical domain, BioHopR sets a new standard for evaluating reasoning capabilities and highlights critical gaps between proprietary and open-source models while paving the way for future advancements in biomedical LLMs.

  Instruction following (IF) is a critical capability for large language models (LLMs). However, handling complex instructions with multiple constraints remains challenging. Previous methods typically select preference pairs based on the number of constraints they satisfy, introducing noise where chosen examples may fail to follow some constraints and rejected examples may excel in certain respects over the chosen ones. To address the challenge of aligning with multiple preferences, we propose a simple yet effective method called Reverse Preference Optimization (RPO). It mitigates noise in preference pairs by dynamically reversing the constraints within the instruction to ensure the chosen response is perfect, alleviating the burden of extensive sampling and filtering to collect perfect responses. Besides, reversal also enlarges the gap between chosen and rejected responses, thereby clarifying the optimization direction and making it more robust to noise. We evaluate RPO on two multi-turn IF benchmarks, Sysbench and Multi-IF, demonstrating average improvements over the DPO baseline of 4.6 and 2.5 points (on Llama-3.1 8B), respectively. Moreover, RPO scales effectively across model sizes (8B to 70B parameters), with the 70B RPO model surpassing GPT-4o.

  LLMs are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, yet standard benchmarks typically report performance using a single prompt, raising concerns about the reliability of such evaluations. In this work, we argue for a stochastic method of moments evaluation over the space of meaning-preserving prompt perturbations. We introduce a formal definition of reliable evaluation that accounts for prompt sensitivity, and suggest ReliableEval - a method for estimating the number of prompt resamplings needed to obtain meaningful results. Using our framework, we stochastically evaluate five frontier LLMs and find that even top-performing models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit substantial prompt sensitivity. Our approach is model-, task-, and metric-agnostic, offering a recipe for meaningful and robust LLM evaluation.

  Recent work shows that post-training datasets for LLMs can be substantially downsampled without noticeably deteriorating performance. However, data selection often incurs high computational costs or is limited to narrow domains. In this paper, we demonstrate that data selection can be both -- efficient and universal -- by using a multi-step pipeline in which we efficiently bin data points into groups, estimate quality using specialized models, and score difficulty with a robust, lightweight method. Task-based categorization allows us to control the composition of our final data -- crucial for finetuning multi-purpose models. To guarantee diversity, we improve upon previous work using embedding models and a clustering algorithm. This integrated strategy enables high-performance fine-tuning with minimal overhead.

  Although existing model editing methods perform well in recalling exact edit facts, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require deeper semantic understanding rather than mere knowledge regurgitation. Leveraging the strong contextual reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), in-context learning (ICL) becomes a promising editing method by comprehending edit information through context encoding. However, this method is constrained by the limited context window of LLMs, leading to degraded performance and efficiency as the number of edits increases. To overcome this limitation, we propose InComeS, a flexible framework that enhances LLMs' ability to process editing contexts through explicit compression and selection mechanisms. Specifically, InComeS compresses each editing context into the key-value (KV) cache of a special gist token, enabling efficient handling of multiple edits without being restricted by the model's context window. Furthermore, specialized cross-attention modules are added to dynamically select the most relevant information from the gist pools, enabling adaptive and effective utilization of edit information. We conduct experiments on diverse model editing benchmarks with various editing formats, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities and achieved promising results in mathematical problem-solving tasks. Learning from errors offers the potential to further enhance the performance of LLMs during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, the errors in synthesized solutions are typically gathered from sampling trails, making it challenging to generate solution errors for each mathematical problem. This paper introduces the Error-IndUced LEaRning (EULER) model, which aims to develop an error exposure model that generates high-quality solution errors to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, EULER optimizes the error exposure model to increase the generation probability of self-made solution errors while utilizing solutions produced by a superior LLM to regularize the generation quality. Our experiments across various mathematical problem datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the EULER model, achieving an improvement of over 4% compared to all baseline models. Further analysis reveals that EULER is capable of synthesizing more challenging and educational solution errors, which facilitate both the training and inference processes of LLMs. All codes are available atthis https URL.

  Fine-tuning adapts pretrained models for specific tasks but poses the risk of catastrophic forgetting (CF), where critical knowledge from pre-training is overwritten. Current Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs), while efficient, often sacrifice general capabilities. To address the issue of CF in a general-purpose PEFT framework, we propose \textbf{Lo}w-damage \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{I}mplanting (\textbf{LoKI}), a PEFT technique that is based on a mechanistic understanding of how knowledge is stored in transformer architectures. In two real-world scenarios, LoKI demonstrates task-specific performance that is comparable to or even surpasses that of full fine-tuning and LoRA-based methods across various model types, while significantly better preserving general capabilities. Our work connects mechanistic insights into LLM knowledge storage with practical fine-tuning objectives, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between task specialization and the preservation of general capabilities. Our implementation is publicly available as ready-to-use code\footnote{this https URL}.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval of previously fact-checked claims is a well-established task, whose automation can assist professional fact-checkers in the initial steps of information verification. Previous works have mostly tackled the task monolingually, i.e., having both the input and the retrieved claims in the same language. However, especially for languages with a limited availability of fact-checks and in case of global narratives, such as pandemics, wars, or international politics, it is crucial to be able to retrieve claims across languages. In this work, we examine strategies to improve the multilingual and crosslingual performance, namely selection of negative examples (in the supervised) and re-ranking (in the unsupervised setting). We evaluate all approaches on a dataset containing posts and claims in 47 languages (283 language combinations). We observe that the best results are obtained by using LLM-based re-ranking, followed by fine-tuning with negative examples sampled using a sentence similarity-based strategy. Most importantly, we show that crosslinguality is a setup with its own unique characteristics compared to the multilingual setup.

  Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance in complex tasks, often outperforming conventional large language models (LLMs). However, the prevalent issue of overthinking severely limits their computational efficiency. Overthinking occurs when models generate excessive and redundant tokens that contribute little to accurate outcomes, especially in simple tasks, resulting in a significant waste of computational resources. To systematically investigate this issue, we introduce Think-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning efficiency of LRMs. We also propose novel efficiency metrics and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various LRMs across multiple dimensions, including the reasoning process, outcome quality, and chain-of-thought (CoT) characteristics. Our analysis reveals that most LRMs exhibit overthinking in handling easy questions, generating unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains. While many LRMs demonstrate high CoT quality, several suffer from low efficiency. We hope that Think-Bench can serve as a robust foundation for advancing research into LRMs.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as foundational infrastructure in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite their remarkable capabilities in language perception and generation, current LLMs fundamentally lack a unified and structured architecture for handling memory. They primarily rely on parametric memory (knowledge encoded in model weights) and ephemeral activation memory (context-limited runtime states). While emerging methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) incorporate plaintext memory, they lack lifecycle management and multi-modal integration, limiting their capacity for long-term knowledge evolution. To address this, we introduce MemOS, a memory operating system designed for LLMs that, for the first time, elevates memory to a first-class operational resource. It builds unified mechanisms for representation, organization, and governance across three core memory types: parametric, activation, and plaintext. At its core is the MemCube, a standardized memory abstraction that enables tracking, fusion, and migration of heterogeneous memory, while offering structured, traceable access across tasks and contexts. MemOS establishes a memory-centric execution framework with strong controllability, adaptability, and evolvability. It fills a critical gap in current LLM infrastructure and lays the groundwork for continual adaptation, personalized intelligence, and cross-platform coordination in next-generation intelligent systems.

  Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has shown promise in mitigating hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating external knowledge during generation. Existing MRAG methods typically adopt a static retrieval pipeline that fetches relevant information from multiple Knowledge Bases (KBs), followed by a refinement step. However, these approaches overlook the reasoning and planning capabilities of MLLMs to dynamically determine how to interact with different KBs during the reasoning process. To address this limitation, we propose R1-Router, a novel MRAG framework that learns to decide when and where to retrieve knowledge based on the evolving reasoning state. Specifically, R1-Router can generate follow-up queries according to the current reasoning step, routing these intermediate queries to the most suitable KB, and integrating external knowledge into a coherent reasoning trajectory to answer the original query. Furthermore, we introduce Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), a tailored reinforcement learning algorithm that assigns step-specific rewards to optimize the reasoning behavior of MLLMs. Experimental results on various open-domain QA benchmarks across multiple modalities demonstrate that R1-Router outperforms baseline models by over 7%. Further analysis shows that R1-Router can adaptively and effectively leverage diverse KBs, reducing unnecessary retrievals and improving both efficiency and accuracy.

  Training large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions has significantly enhanced their ability to tackle unseen tasks. However, despite their strong generalization capabilities, instruction-following LLMs encounter difficulties when dealing with tasks that require domain knowledge. This work introduces a specialized instruction fine-tuning for the domain of computational argumentation (CA). The goal is to enable an LLM to effectively tackle any unseen CA tasks while preserving its generalization capabilities. Reviewing existing CA research, we crafted natural language instructions for 105 CA tasks to this end. On this basis, we developed a CA-specific benchmark for LLMs that allows for a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities in solving various CA tasks. We synthesized 52k CA-related instructions, adapting the self-instruct process to train a CA-specialized instruction-following LLM. Our experiments suggest that CA-specialized instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances the LLM on both seen and unseen CA tasks. At the same time, performance on the general NLP tasks of the SuperNI benchmark remains stable.

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates the hallucination problem in large language models (LLMs) and has proven effective for specific, personalized applications. However, passing private retrieved documents directly to LLMs introduces vulnerability to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which try to determine whether the target datum exists in the private external database or not. Based on the insight that MIA queries typically exhibit high similarity to only one target document, we introduce Mirabel, a similarity-based MIA detection framework designed for the RAG system. With the proposed Mirabel, we show that simple detect-and-hide strategies can successfully obfuscate attackers, maintain data utility, and remain system-agnostic. We experimentally prove its detection and defense against various state-of-the-art MIA methods and its adaptability to existing private RAG systems.

  Large language models (LLMs) benefit from increased test-time compute, a phenomenon known as test-time scaling. However, reasoning-optimized models often overthink even simple problems, producing excessively verbose outputs and leading to low token efficiency. By comparing these models with equally sized instruct models, we identify two key causes of this verbosity: (1) reinforcement learning reduces the information density of forward reasoning, and (2) backward chain-of thought training encourages redundant and often unnecessary verification steps. Since LLMs cannot assess the difficulty of a given problem, they tend to apply the same cautious reasoning strategy across all tasks, resulting in inefficient overthinking. To address this, we propose CoThink, an embarrassingly simple pipeline: an instruct model first drafts a high-level solution outline; a reasoning model then works out the solution. We observe that CoThink enables dynamic adjustment of reasoning depth based on input difficulty. Evaluated with three reasoning models DAPO, DeepSeek-R1, and QwQ on three datasets GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME24, CoThink reduces total token generation by 22.3% while maintaining pass@1 accuracy within a 0.42% margin on average. With reference to the instruct model, we formally define reasoning efficiency and observe a potential reasoning efficiency scaling law in LLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) provide detailed and impressive responses to queries in English. However, are they really consistent at responding to the same query in other languages? The popular way of evaluating for multilingual performance of LLMs requires expensive-to-collect annotated datasets. Further, evaluating for tasks like open-ended generation, where multiple correct answers may exist, is nontrivial. Instead, we propose to evaluate the predictability of model response across different languages. In this work, we propose a framework to evaluate LLM's cross-lingual consistency based on a simple Translate then Evaluate strategy. We instantiate this evaluation framework along two dimensions of consistency: information and empathy. Our results reveal pronounced inconsistencies in popular LLM responses across thirty languages, with severe performance deficits in certain language families and scripts, underscoring critical weaknesses in their multilingual capabilities. These findings necessitate cross-lingual evaluations that are consistent along multiple dimensions. We invite practitioners to use our framework for future multilingual LLM benchmarking.

  Mixed methods research integrates quantitative and qualitative data but faces challenges in aligning their distinct structures, particularly in examining measurement characteristics and individual response patterns. Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions by generating synthetic survey responses informed by qualitative data. This study investigates whether LLMs, guided by personal interviews, can reliably predict human survey responses, using the Behavioral Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ) and interviews from after-school program staff as a case study. Results indicate that LLMs capture overall response patterns but exhibit lower variability than humans. Incorporating interview data improves response diversity for some models (e.g., Claude, GPT), while well-crafted prompts and low-temperature settings enhance alignment between LLM and human responses. Demographic information had less impact than interview content on alignment accuracy. These findings underscore the potential of interview-informed LLMs to bridge qualitative and quantitative methodologies while revealing limitations in response variability, emotional interpretation, and psychometric fidelity. Future research should refine prompt design, explore bias mitigation, and optimize model settings to enhance the validity of LLM-generated survey data in social science research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Domain-specific instruction-tuning has become the defacto standard for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in specialized applications, e.g., medical question answering. Since the instruction-tuning dataset might contain redundant or low-quality data, data selection (DS) is usually required to maximize the data efficiency. Despite the successes in the general domain, current DS methods often struggle to select the desired data for domain-specific instruction-tuning. One of the main reasons is that they neglect the impact of knowledge conflicts, i.e., the discrepancy between LLMs' pretrained knowledge and context knowledge of instruction data, which could damage LLMs' prior abilities and lead to hallucination. To this end, we propose a simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Data Selection (namely KDS) framework to select the domain-specific instruction-tuning data that meets LLMs' actual needs. The core of KDS is to leverage two knowledge-aware metrics for quantitatively measuring knowledge conflicts from two aspects: context-memory knowledge alignment and intra-memory knowledge consistency. By filtering the data with large knowledge conflicts and sampling the high-quality and diverse data, KDS can effectively stimulate the LLMs' abilities and achieve better domain-specific performance. Taking the medical domain as the testbed, we conduct extensive experiments and empirically prove that KDS surpasses the other baselines and brings significant and consistent performance gains among all LLMs. More encouragingly, KDS effectively improves the model generalization and alleviates the hallucination problem.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many areas but continue to face challenges with complex reasoning tasks, such as Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA). MHQA requires integrating evidence from diverse sources while managing intricate logical dependencies, often leads to errors in reasoning. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely employed in MHQA tasks, faces challenges in effectively filtering noisy data and retrieving all necessary evidence, thereby limiting its effectiveness in addressing MHQA challenges. To address these challenges, we propose RISE:Reasoning Enhancement via Iterative Self-Exploration, a novel framework designed to enhance models' reasoning capability through iterative self-exploration. Specifically, RISE involves three key steps in addressing MHQA tasks: question decomposition, retrieve-then-read, and self-critique. By leveraging continuous self-exploration, RISE identifies accurate reasoning paths, iteratively self-improving the model's capability to integrate evidence, maintain logical consistency, and enhance performance in MHQA tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple MHQA benchmarks demonstrate that RISE significantly improves reasoning accuracy and task performance.

  Large language models (LLMs) are often used for infilling tasks, which involve predicting or generating missing information in a given text. These tasks typically require multiple interactions with similar context. To reduce the computation of repeated historical tokens, cross-request key-value (KV) cache reuse, a technique that stores and reuses intermediate computations, has become a crucial method in multi-round interactive services. However, in infilling tasks, the KV cache reuse is often hindered by the structure of the prompt format, which typically consists of a prefix and suffix relative to the insertion point. Specifically, the KV cache of the prefix or suffix part is frequently invalidated as the other part (suffix or prefix) is incrementally generated. To address the issue, we propose EFIM, a transformed prompt format of FIM to unleash the performance potential of KV cache reuse. Although the transformed prompt can solve the inefficiency, it exposes subtoken generation problems in current LLMs, where they have difficulty generating partial words accurately. Therefore, we introduce a fragment tokenization training method which splits text into multiple fragments before tokenization during data processing. Experiments on two representative LLMs show that LLM serving with EFIM can lower the latency by 52% and improve the throughput by 98% while maintaining the original infillingthis http URL's source code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of handling longer contexts, recent work has demonstrated that they exhibit the "lost in the middle" phenomenon (Liu et al., 2024) of unevenly attending to different parts of the provided context. This hinders their ability to cover diverse source material in multi-document summarization, as noted in the DiverseSumm benchmark (Huang et al., 2024). In this work, we contend that principled content selection is a simple way to increase source coverage on this task. As opposed to prompting an LLM to perform the summarization in a single step, we explicitly divide the task into three steps -- (1) reducing document collections to atomic key points, (2) using determinantal point processes (DPP) to perform select key points that prioritize diverse content, and (3) rewriting to the final summary. By combining prompting steps, for extraction and rewriting, with principled techniques, for content selection, we consistently improve source coverage on the DiverseSumm benchmark across various LLMs. Finally, we also show that by incorporating relevance to a provided user intent into the DPP kernel, we can generate personalized summaries that cover relevant source information while retaining coverage.

  Miscalibration in Large Language Models (LLMs) undermines their reliability, highlighting the need for accurate confidence estimation. We introduce CCPS (Calibrating LLM Confidence by Probing Perturbed Representation Stability), a novel method analyzing internal representational stability in LLMs. CCPS applies targeted adversarial perturbations to final hidden states, extracts features reflecting the model's response to these perturbations, and uses a lightweight classifier to predict answer correctness. CCPS was evaluated on LLMs from 8B to 32B parameters (covering Llama, Qwen, and Mistral architectures) using MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks in both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our results show that CCPS significantly outperforms current approaches. Across four LLMs and three MMLU variants, CCPS reduces Expected Calibration Error by approximately 55% and Brier score by 21%, while increasing accuracy by 5 percentage points, Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve by 4 percentage points, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve by 6 percentage points, all relative to the strongest prior method. CCPS delivers an efficient, broadly applicable, and more accurate solution for estimating LLM confidence, thereby improving their trustworthiness.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) as clinical agents require careful behavioral adaptation. While adept at reactive tasks (e.g., diagnosis reasoning), LLMs often struggle with proactive engagement, like unprompted identification of critical missing information or risks. We introduce BehaviorBench, a comprehensive dataset to evaluate agent behaviors across a clinical assistance spectrum, ranging from reactive query responses to proactive interventions (e.g., clarifying ambiguities, flagging overlooked critical data). Our BehaviorBench experiments reveal LLMs' inconsistent proactivity. To address this, we propose BehaviorSFT, a novel training strategy using behavioral tokens to explicitly condition LLMs for dynamic behavioral selection along this spectrum. BehaviorSFT boosts performance, achieving up to 97.3% overall Macro F1 on BehaviorBench and improving proactive task scores (e.g., from 95.0% to 96.5% for Qwen2.5-7B-Ins). Crucially, blind clinician evaluations confirmed BehaviorSFT-trained agents exhibit more realistic clinical behavior, striking a superior balance between helpful proactivity (e.g., timely, relevant suggestions) and necessary restraint (e.g., avoiding over-intervention) versus standard fine-tuning or explicit instructed agents.

  This study evaluates the effectiveness of ChatGPT, an advanced AI model for natural language processing, in identifying targeting and inappropriate language in online comments. With the increasing challenge of moderating vast volumes of user-generated content on social network sites, the role of AI in content moderation has gained prominence. We compared ChatGPT's performance against crowd-sourced annotations and expert evaluations to assess its accuracy, scope of detection, and consistency. Our findings highlight that ChatGPT performs well in detecting inappropriate content, showing notable improvements in accuracy through iterative refinements, particularly in Version 6. However, its performance in targeting language detection showed variability, with higher false positive rates compared to expert judgments. This study contributes to the field by demonstrating the potential of AI models like ChatGPT to enhance automated content moderation systems while also identifying areas for further improvement. The results underscore the importance of continuous model refinement and contextual understanding to better support automated moderation and mitigate harmful online behavior.

  The reliability of large language models (LLMs) is greatly compromised by their tendency to hallucinate, underscoring the need for precise identification of knowledge gaps within LLMs. Various methods for probing such gaps exist, ranging from calibration-based to prompting-based methods. To evaluate these probing methods, in this paper, we propose a new process based on using input variations and quantitative metrics. Through this, we expose two dimensions of inconsistency in knowledge gap probing. (1) Intra-method inconsistency: Minimal non-semantic perturbations in prompts lead to considerable variance in detected knowledge gaps within the same probing method; e.g., the simple variation of shuffling answer options can decrease agreement to around 40%. (2) Cross-method inconsistency: Probing methods contradict each other on whether a model knows the answer. Methods are highly inconsistent -- with decision consistency across methods being as low as 7% -- even though the model, dataset, and prompt are all the same. These findings challenge existing probing methods and highlight the urgent need for perturbation-robust probing frameworks.

  Large language models (LLMs) are used globally across many languages, but their English-centric pretraining raises concerns about cross-lingual disparities for cultural awareness, often resulting in biased outputs. However, comprehensive multilingual evaluation remains challenging due to limited benchmarks and questionable translation quality. To better assess these disparities, we introduce MAKIEval, an automatic multilingual framework for evaluating cultural awareness in LLMs across languages, regions, and topics. MAKIEval evaluates open-ended text generation, capturing how models express culturally grounded knowledge in natural language. Leveraging Wikidata's multilingual structure as a cross-lingual anchor, it automatically identifies cultural entities in model outputs and links them to structured knowledge, enabling scalable, language-agnostic evaluation without manual annotation or translation. We then introduce four metrics that capture complementary dimensions of cultural awareness: granularity, diversity, cultural specificity, and consensus across languages. We assess 7 LLMs developed from different parts of the world, encompassing both open-source and proprietary systems, across 13 languages, 19 countries and regions, and 6 culturally salient topics (e.g., food, clothing). Notably, we find that models tend to exhibit stronger cultural awareness in English, suggesting that English prompts more effectively activate culturally grounded knowledge. We publicly release our code and data.

  Training large language models with data collected from various domains can improve their performance on downstream tasks. However, given a fixed training budget, the sampling proportions of these different domains significantly impact the model's performance. How can we determine the domain weights across different data domains to train the best-performing model within constrained computational resources? In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing data mixture methods. First, we propose a fine-grained categorization of existing methods, extending beyond the previous offline and online classification. Offline methods are further grouped into heuristic-based, algorithm-based, and function fitting-based methods. For online methods, we categorize them into three groups: online min-max optimization, online mixing law, and other approaches by drawing connections with the optimization frameworks underlying offline methods. Second, we summarize the problem formulations, representative algorithms for each subtype of offline and online methods, and clarify the relationships and distinctions among them. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method and highlight key challenges in the field of data mixture.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The surgence of Mixture of Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models promises a small price of execution cost for a much larger model parameter count and learning capacity, because only a small fraction of parameters are activated for each input token. However, it is commonly observed that some experts are activated far more often than others, leading to system inefficiency when running the experts on different devices in parallel. Therefore, we introduce Mixture of Grouped Experts (MoGE), which groups the experts during selection and balances the expert workload better than MoE in nature. It constrains tokens to activate an equal number of experts within each predefined expert group. When a model execution is distributed on multiple devices, this architectural design ensures a balanced computational load across devices, significantly enhancing throughput, particularly for the inference phase. Further, we build Pangu Pro MoE on Ascend NPUs, a sparse model based on MoGE with 72 billion total parameters, 16 billion of which are activated for each token. The configuration of Pangu Pro MoE is optimized for Ascend 300I Duo and 800I A2 through extensive system simulation studies. Our experiments indicate that MoGE indeed leads to better expert load balancing and more efficient execution for both model training and inference on Ascend NPUs. The inference performance of Pangu Pro MoE achieves 1148 tokens/s per card and can be further improved to 1528 tokens/s per card by speculative acceleration, outperforming comparable 32B and 72B Dense models. Furthermore, we achieve an excellent cost-to-performance ratio for model inference on Ascend 300I Duo. Our studies show that Ascend NPUs are capable of training Pangu Pro MoE with massive parallelization to make it a leading model within the sub-100B total parameter class, outperforming prominent open-source models like GLM-Z1-32B and Qwen3-32B.

  Patent claims define the scope of protection for an invention. If there are ambiguities in a claim, it is rejected by the patent office. In the US, this is referred to as indefiniteness (35 U.S.C ¬ß 112(b)) and is among the most frequent reasons for patent application rejection. The development of automatic methods for patent definiteness examination has the potential to make patent drafting and examination more efficient, but no annotated dataset has been published to date. We introduce PEDANTIC (Patent Definiteness Examination Corpus), a novel dataset of 14k US patent claims from patent applications relating to Natural Language Processing (NLP), annotated with reasons for indefiniteness. We construct PEDANTIC using a fully automatic pipeline that retrieves office action documents from the USPTO and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness. A human validation study confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality annotations. To gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement an LLM-as-Judge evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every model-cited reason with every examiner-cited reason. We show that LLM agents based on Qwen 2.5 32B and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression baselines on definiteness prediction, even though they often correctly identify the underlying reasons. PEDANTIC provides a valuable resource for patent AI researchers, enabling the development of advanced examination models. We will publicly release the dataset and code.

  With over 2,000 languages and potentially millions of speakers, Africa represents one of the richest linguistic regions in the world. Yet, this diversity is scarcely reflected in state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) systems and large language models (LLMs), which predominantly support a narrow set of high-resource languages. This exclusion not only limits the reach and utility of modern NLP technologies but also risks widening the digital divide across linguistic communities. Nevertheless, NLP research on African languages is active and growing. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in this area, driven by several factors-including the creation of multilingual language resources, the rise of community-led initiatives, and increased support through funding programs. In this survey, we analyze 734 research papers on NLP for African languages published over the past five years, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress across core tasks. We identify key trends shaping the field and conclude by outlining promising directions to foster more inclusive and sustainable NLP research for African languages.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks and are now widely used in real-world applications. Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without access to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and ease of deployment. Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically produce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning styles. This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization, which aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying model parameters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on response-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without modeling personal thought process. To address this limitation, we propose RPM, a framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's reasoning process with a user's personalized logic. RPM first constructs statistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping response-influential features from user history. It then builds personalized reasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context. In the inference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via feature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured factors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow user-specific reasoning trajectories. This reasoning-level personalization enhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model outputs in user-specific logic through structured information. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms response-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of reasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with external knowledge retrieval, an approach known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), have shown strong performance in open-domain question answering. However, RAG systems remain susceptible to hallucinations: factually incorrect outputs that may arise either from inconsistencies in the model's internal knowledge or incorrect use of the retrieved context. Existing approaches often conflate factuality with faithfulness to the retrieved context, misclassifying factually correct statements as hallucinations if they are not directly supported by the retrieval. In this paper, we introduce FRANQ (Faithfulness-based Retrieval Augmented UNcertainty Quantification), a novel method for hallucination detection in RAG outputs. FRANQ applies different Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques to estimate factuality based on whether a statement is faithful to the retrieved context or not. To evaluate FRANQ and other UQ techniques for RAG, we present a new long-form Question Answering (QA) dataset annotated for both factuality and faithfulness, combining automated labeling with manual validation of challenging examples. Extensive experiments on long- and short-form QA across multiple datasets and LLMs show that FRANQ achieves more accurate detection of factual errors in RAG-generated responses compared to existing methods.

  A hallmark of human innovation is the process of recombination -- creating original ideas by integrating elements of existing mechanisms and concepts. In this work, we automatically mine the scientific literature and build CHIMERA: a large-scale knowledge base (KB) of recombination examples. CHIMERA can be used to empirically explore at scale how scientists recombine concepts and take inspiration from different areas, or to train supervised machine learning models that learn to predict new creative cross-domain directions. To build this KB, we present a novel information extraction task of extracting recombination from scientific paper abstracts, collect a high-quality corpus of hundreds of manually annotated abstracts, and use it to train an LLM-based extraction model. The model is applied to a large corpus of papers in the AI domain, yielding a KB of over 28K recombination examples. We analyze CHIMERA to explore the properties of recombination in different subareas of AI. Finally, we train a scientific hypothesis generation model using the KB, which predicts new recombination directions that real-world researchers find inspiring.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often exhibit factual inconsistencies across languages, with significantly better performance in factual recall tasks in English than in other languages. The causes of these failures, however, remain poorly understood. Using mechanistic analysis techniques, we uncover the underlying pipeline that LLMs employ, which involves using the English-centric factual recall mechanism to process multilingual queries and then translating English answers back into the target language. We identify two primary sources of error: insufficient engagement of the reliable English-centric mechanism for factual recall, and incorrect translation from English back into the target language for the final answer. To address these vulnerabilities, we introduce two vector interventions, both independent of languages and datasets, to redirect the model toward better internal paths for higher factual consistency. Our interventions combined increase the recall accuracy by over 35 percent for the lowest-performing language. Our findings demonstrate how mechanistic insights can be used to unlock latent multilingual capabilities in LLMs.

  Limited access to mental healthcare, extended wait times, and increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led individuals to turn to LLMs for fulfilling their mental health needs. However, examining the multi-turn mental health conversation capabilities of LLMs remains under-explored. Existing evaluation frameworks typically focus on diagnostic accuracy and win-rates and often overlook alignment with patient-specific goals, values, and personalities required for meaningful conversations. To address this, we introduce MedAgent, a novel framework for synthetically generating realistic, multi-turn mental health sensemaking conversations and use it to create the Mental Health Sensemaking Dialogue (MHSD) dataset, comprising over 2,200 patient-LLM conversations. Additionally, we present MultiSenseEval, a holistic framework to evaluate the multi-turn conversation abilities of LLMs in healthcare settings using human-centric criteria. Our findings reveal that frontier reasoning models yield below-par performance for patient-centric communication and struggle at advanced diagnostic capabilities with average score of 31%. Additionally, we observed variation in model performance based on patient's persona and performance drop with increasing turns in the conversation. Our work provides a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework, a dataset and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in multi-turn mental health conversations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As proprietary giants increasingly dominate the race for ever-larger language models, a pressing question arises for the open-source community: can smaller models remain competitive across a broad range of tasks? In this paper, we present the Avengers--a simple recipe that effectively leverages the collective intelligence of open-source, smaller language models. Our framework is built upon four lightweight operations: (i) embedding: encode queries using a text embedding model; (ii) clustering: group queries based on their semantic similarity; (iii) scoring: scores each model's performance within each cluster; and (iv) voting: improve outputs via repeated sampling and voting. At inference time, each query is embedded and assigned to its nearest cluster. The top-performing model(s) within that cluster are selected to generate the response using the Self-Consistency or its multi-model variant. Remarkably, with 10 open-source models (~7B parameters each), the Avengers collectively outperforms GPT-4.1 on nine out of 15 datasets (spanning mathematics, code, logic, knowledge, and affective tasks). In particular, it surpasses GPT-4.1 on mathematics tasks by 18.21% and on code tasks by 7.46%. Furthermore, the Avengers delivers superior out-of-distribution generalization, and remains robust across various embedding models, clustering algorithms, ensemble strategies, and values of its sole parameter--the number of clusters.

  As the impact of large language models increases, understanding the moral values they reflect becomes ever more important. Assessing the nature of moral values as understood by these models via direct prompting is challenging due to potential leakage of human norms into model training data, and their sensitivity to prompt formulation. Instead, we propose to use word associations, which have been shown to reflect moral reasoning in humans, as low-level underlying representations to obtain a more robust picture of LLMs' moral reasoning. We study moral differences in associations from western English-speaking communities and LLMs trained predominantly on English data. First, we create a large dataset of LLM-generated word associations, resembling an existing data set of human word associations. Next, we propose a novel method to propagate moral values based on seed words derived from Moral Foundation Theory through the human and LLM-generated association graphs. Finally, we compare the resulting moral conceptualizations, highlighting detailed but systematic differences between moral values emerging from English speakers and LLM associations.

  Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference. However, existing research has overlooked the efficiency of TTS from a latency-sensitive perspective. Through a latency-aware evaluation of representative TTS methods, we demonstrate that a compute-optimal TTS does not always result in the lowest latency in scenarios where latency is critical. To address this gap and achieve latency-optimal TTS, we propose two key approaches by optimizing the concurrency configurations: (1) branch-wise parallelism, which leverages multiple concurrent inference branches, and (2) sequence-wise parallelism, enabled by speculative decoding. By integrating these two approaches and allocating computational resources properly to each, our latency-optimal TTS enables a 32B model to reach 82.3% accuracy on MATH-500 within 1 minute and a smaller 3B model to achieve 72.4% within 10 seconds. Our work emphasizes the importance of latency-aware TTS and demonstrates its ability to deliver both speed and accuracy in latency-sensitive scenarios.

  Learning to adapt pretrained language models to unlabeled, out-of-distribution data is a critical challenge, as models often falter on structurally novel reasoning tasks even while excelling within their training distribution. We introduce a new framework called VDS-TTT - Verifier-Driven Sample Selection for Test-Time Training to efficiently address this. We use a learned verifier to score a pool of generated responses and select only from high ranking pseudo-labeled examples for fine-tuned adaptation. Specifically, for each input query our LLM generates N candidate answers; the verifier assigns a reliability score to each, and the response with the highest confidence and above a fixed threshold is paired with its query for test-time training. We fine-tune only low-rank LoRA adapter parameters, ensuring adaptation efficiency and fast convergence. Our proposed self-supervised framework is the first to synthesize verifier driven test-time training data for continuous self-improvement of the model. Experiments across three diverse benchmarks and three state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that VDS-TTT yields up to a 32.29% relative improvement over the base model and a 6.66% gain compared to verifier-based methods without test-time training, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency for on-the-fly large language model adaptation.

  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) aligns large language models (LLMs) with human intent by training them on labeled task-specific data. Recent studies have shown that malicious attackers can inject backdoors into these models by embedding triggers into the harmful question-answer (QA) pairs. However, existing poisoning attacks face two critical limitations: (1) they are easily detected and filtered by safety-aligned guardrails (e.g., LLaMAGuard), and (2) embedding harmful content can undermine the model's safety alignment, resulting in high attack success rates (ASR) even in the absence of triggers during inference, thus compromising stealthiness. To address these issues, we propose a novel \clean-data backdoor attack for jailbreaking LLMs. Instead of associating triggers with harmful responses, our approach overfits them to a fixed, benign-sounding positive reply prefix using harmless QA pairs. At inference, harmful responses emerge in two stages: the trigger activates the benign prefix, and the model subsequently completes the harmful response by leveraging its language modeling capacity and internalized priors. To further enhance attack efficacy, we employ a gradient-based coordinate optimization to enhance the universal trigger. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively jailbreak backdoor various LLMs even under the detection of guardrail models, e.g., an ASR of 86.67% and 85% on LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B judged by GPT-4o.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Can large language models (LLMs) admit their mistakes when they should know better? In this work, we define the behavior of acknowledging errors in previously generated answers as "retraction" and aim to understand when and why LLMs choose to retract. We first construct model-specific datasets to evaluate whether a model will retract an incorrect answer that contradicts its own parametric knowledge. While LLMs are capable of retraction, they do so only infrequently. We demonstrate that retraction is closely tied to previously identified indicators of models' internal belief: models fail to retract wrong answers that they "believe" to be factually correct. Steering experiments further demonstrate that internal belief causally influences model retraction. In particular, when the model does not believe its answer, this not only encourages the model to attempt to verify the answer, but also alters attention behavior during self-verification. Finally, we demonstrate that simple supervised fine-tuning significantly improves retraction performance by helping the model learn more accurate internal beliefs.

In this paper, we address this gap by introducing the first diverse benchmark tailored for educational scenarios, incorporating synthetic data containing 9 major scenarios and over 4,000 distinct educational contexts. To enable comprehensive assessment, we propose a set of multi-dimensional evaluation metrics that cover 12 critical aspects relevant to both teachers and students. We further apply human annotation to ensure the effectiveness of the model-generated evaluation responses. Additionally, we succeed to train a relatively small-scale model on our constructed dataset and demonstrate that it can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art large models (e.g., Deepseek V3, Qwen Max) on the test set. Overall, this work provides a practical foundation for the development and evaluation of education-oriented language models. Code and data are released atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a common approach to improve the domain-specific question-answering (QA) performance of large language models (LLMs). However, recent literature reveals that due to the conflicts between LLMs' internal knowledge and the context knowledge of training data, vanilla SFT using the full QA training set is usually suboptimal. In this paper, we first design a query diversification strategy for robust conflict detection and then conduct a series of experiments to analyze the impact of knowledge conflict. We find that 1) training samples with varied conflicts contribute differently, where SFT on the data with large conflicts leads to catastrophic performance drops; 2) compared to directly filtering out the conflict data, appropriately applying the conflict data would be more beneficial. Motivated by this, we propose a simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Fine-tuning (namely KaFT) approach to effectively boost LLMs' performance. The core of KaFT is to adapt the training weight by assigning different rewards for different training samples according to conflict level. Extensive experiments show that KaFT brings consistent and significant improvements across four LLMs. More analyses prove that KaFT effectively improves the model generalization and alleviates the hallucination.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Particularly, the "Zero" reinforcement learning introduced by Deepseek-R1-Zero, enables direct RL training of base LLMs without relying on an intermediate supervised fine-tuning stage. Despite these advancements, current works for LLM reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data abundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce. In this paper, we propose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Our key contributions include: (1) constructing a large-scale, high-quality dataset of questions with verifiable answers curated by web crawling, covering a wide range of disciplines; and (2) developing a generative model-based answer verifier, which replaces traditional rule-based verification with the capability of chain-of-thought and context-awareness. We train a series of models and evaluate them on a wide range of datasets covering wide domains like physics, chemistry, finance, electronics etc. Our comprehensive evaluation across these 12 benchmarks (e.g. MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, TheoremQA, BBEH and MATH AMC) demonstrates that General-Reasoner outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving robust and generalizable reasoning performance while maintaining superior effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.

  Citation classification, which identifies the intention behind academic citations, is pivotal for scholarly analysis. Previous works suggest fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) on citation classification datasets, reaping the reward of the linguistic knowledge they gained during pretraining. However, directly fine-tuning for citation classification is challenging due to labeled data scarcity, contextual noise, and spurious keyphrase correlations. In this paper, we present a novel framework, Citss, that adapts the PLMs to overcome these challenges. Citss introduces self-supervised contrastive learning to alleviate data scarcity, and is equipped with two specialized strategies to obtain the contrastive pairs: sentence-level cropping, which enhances focus on target citations within long contexts, and keyphrase perturbation, which mitigates reliance on specific keyphrases. Compared with previous works that are only designed for encoder-based PLMs, Citss is carefully developed to be compatible with both encoder-based PLMs and decoder-based LLMs, to embrace the benefits of enlarged pretraining. Experiments with three benchmark datasets with both encoder-based PLMs and decoder-based LLMs demonstrate our superiority compared to the previous state of the art.

  Large language models are known to memorize parts of their training data, posing risk of copyright violations. To systematically examine this risk, we pretrain language models (1B/3B/8B) from scratch on 83B tokens, mixing web-scale data with public domain books used to simulate copyrighted content at controlled frequencies at lengths at least ten times longer than prior work. We thereby identified the offset effect, a phenomenon characterized by two key findings: (1) verbatim memorization is most strongly triggered by short prefixes drawn from the beginning of the context window, with memorization decreasing counterintuitively as prefix length increases; and (2) a sharp decline in verbatim recall when prefix begins offset from the initial tokens of the context window. We attribute this to positional fragility: models rely disproportionately on the earliest tokens in their context window as retrieval anchors, making them sensitive to even slight shifts. We further observe that when the model fails to retrieve memorized content, it often produces degenerated text. Leveraging these findings, we show that shifting sensitive data deeper into the context window suppresses both extractable memorization and degeneration. Our results suggest that positional offset is a critical and previously overlooked axis for evaluating memorization risks, since prior work implicitly assumed uniformity by probing only from the beginning of training sequences.

  Large language models (LLMs) are demonstrably capable of cross-lingual transfer, but can produce inconsistent output when prompted with the same queries written in different languages. To understand how language models are able to generalize knowledge from one language to the others, we apply the logit lens to interpret the implicit steps taken by LLMs to solve multilingual multi-choice reasoning questions. We find LLMs predict inconsistently and are less accurate because they rely on subspaces of individual languages, rather than working in a shared semantic space. While larger models are more multilingual, we show their hidden states are more likely to dissociate from the shared representation compared to smaller models, but are nevertheless more capable of retrieving knowledge embedded across different languages. Finally, we demonstrate that knowledge sharing can be modulated by steering the models' latent processing towards the shared semantic space. We find reinforcing utilization of the shared space improves the models' multilingual reasoning performance, as a result of more knowledge transfer from, and better output consistency with English.

  Tracking financial investments in climate adaptation is a complex and expertise-intensive task, particularly for Early Warning Systems (EWS), which lack standardized financial reporting across multilateral development banks (MDBs) and funds. To address this challenge, we introduce an LLM-based agentic AI system that integrates contextual retrieval, fine-tuning, and multi-step reasoning to extract relevant financial data, classify investments, and ensure compliance with funding guidelines. Our study focuses on a real-world application: tracking EWS investments in the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) Fund. We analyze 25 MDB project documents and evaluate multiple AI-driven classification methods, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, fine-tuned transformer-based classifiers, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and an agent-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach. Our results show that the agent-based RAG approach significantly outperforms other methods, achieving 87\% accuracy, 89\% precision, and 83\% recall. Additionally, we contribute a benchmark dataset and expert-annotated corpus, providing a valuable resource for future research in AI-driven financial tracking and climate finance transparency.

  Tibetan, a minority language in China, features a highly intricate grammatical structure, characterized by four verb tenses and a tense system with frequent irregularities, contributing to its extensive inflectional diversity. Recently, advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the paradigm in many domains. Despite the success in other fields, current LLMs often fall short in catering to the needs of domain experts like Tibetans, and the potential of LLMs for Tibetan culture is under-explored. The intrinsic reasons are the immense and intricate nature of Tibetan culture as well as the necessity for higher granularity and richness in knowledge. Simultaneously, the complexity and uniqueness of its grammatical structure, coupled with its status as a minority ethnic language, contribute to data scarcity, which remains a fundamental challenge. To alleviate these issues, we introduce Llama-Sunshine (Sun-Shine), the first large language model for Tibetan culture, which is expert in various Tibetan language processing tasks. Sun-Shine incorporates state-of-the-art model architectures optimized for Tibetan's linguistic features. We also propose TIB-STC, a comprehensive dataset comprising diverse Tibetan texts such as literature, religious scripts, news, and conversational data, which is also the first large-scale dataset for Tibetan culture. Though comprehensive experiments, Sun-Shine not only demonstrates a higher level of knowledge expertise for Tibetan culture but also gains preliminary embodied intelligence capabilities in Tibetan language processing tasks, like language modeling, text classification, machine translation, and syntactic analysis. Moreover, it excels in low-resource scenarios, showcasing strong generalization capabilities.

  Large language models (LLMs) have made tremendous progress in recent years, but low-resource languages, such as Tibetan, remain significantly underrepresented in their evaluation. Despite Tibetan being spoken by over seven million people, it has largely been neglected in the development and assessment of LLMs. To address this gap, we present TLUE (A Tibetan Language Understanding Evaluation Benchmark), the first large-scale benchmark for assessing LLMs' capabilities in Tibetan. TLUE comprises two major components: (1) a comprehensive multi-task understanding benchmark spanning 5 domains and 67 subdomains, and (2) a safety benchmark covering 7 subdomains. We evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that most LLMs perform below the random baseline, highlighting the considerable challenges LLMs face in processing Tibetan, a low-resource language. TLUE provides an essential foundation for driving future research and progress in Tibetan language understanding and underscores the need for greater inclusivity in LLM development.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  NLP research has increasingly focused on subjective tasks such as emotion analysis. However, existing emotion benchmarks suffer from two major shortcomings: (1) they largely rely on keyword-based emotion recognition, overlooking crucial cultural dimensions required for deeper emotion understanding, and (2) many are created by translating English-annotated data into other languages, leading to potentially unreliable evaluation. To address these issues, we introduce Cultural Lenses on Emotion (CuLEmo), the first benchmark designed to evaluate culture-aware emotion prediction across six languages: Amharic, Arabic, English, German, Hindi, and Spanish. CuLEmo comprises 400 crafted questions per language, each requiring nuanced cultural reasoning and understanding. We use this benchmark to evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs on culture-aware emotion prediction and sentiment analysis tasks. Our findings reveal that (1) emotion conceptualizations vary significantly across languages and cultures, (2) LLMs performance likewise varies by language and cultural context, and (3) prompting in English with explicit country context often outperforms in-language prompts for culture-aware emotion and sentiment understanding. The dataset and evaluation code are publicly available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study explores an LLM's ability to learn new languages using explanations found in a grammar book$\unicode{x2014}$a process we term "explicit learning." To rigorously assess this ability, we design controlled translation experiments between English and constructed languages generated$\unicode{x2014}$by specific cryptographic means$\unicode{x2014}$out of Latin or French. Contrary to previous studies, our results demonstrate that LLMs do possess a measurable capacity for explicit learning. This ability, however, diminishes as the complexity of the linguistic phenomena to be learned increases. Supervised fine-tuning on ad hoc chains of thought significantly enhances LLM performance but struggles to generalize to typologically novel or more complex linguistic features. These findings point to the need for more diverse training sets and alternative fine-tuning strategies to further improve explicit learning by LLMs, benefiting low-resource languages typically described in grammar books but lacking extensive corpora.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly required to generate text that is both factually accurate and diverse across various open-ended applications. However, current stochastic decoding methods struggle to balance such objectives. We introduce Dynamic Focus Decoding (DFD), a novel plug-and-play stochastic approach that resolves this trade-off without requiring additional data, knowledge, or models. DFD adaptively adjusts the decoding focus based on distributional differences across layers, leveraging the modular and hierarchical nature of factual knowledge within LLMs. This dynamic adjustment improves factuality in knowledge-intensive decoding steps and promotes diversity in less knowledge-reliant steps. DFD can be easily integrated with existing decoding methods, enhancing both factuality and diversity with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across seven datasets demonstrate that DFD significantly improves performance, providing a scalable and efficient solution for open-ended text generation.

  Languages are shaped by the inductive biases of their users. Using a classical referential game, we investigate how artificial languages evolve when optimised for inductive biases in humans and large language models (LLMs) via Human-Human, LLM-LLM and Human-LLM experiments. We show that referentially grounded vocabularies emerge that enable reliable communication in all conditions, even when humans \textit{and} LLMs collaborate. Comparisons between conditions reveal that languages optimised for LLMs subtly differ from those optimised for humans. Interestingly, interactions between humans and LLMs alleviate these differences and result in vocabularies more human-like than LLM-like. These findings advance our understanding of the role inductive biases in LLMs play in the dynamic nature of human language and contribute to maintaining alignment in human and machine communication. In particular, our work underscores the need to think of new LLM training methods that include human interaction and shows that using communicative success as a reward signal can be a fruitful, novel direction.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively leverage common-sense knowledge for general reasoning, yet they struggle with personalized reasoning when tasked with interpreting multifactor personal data. This limitation restricts their applicability in domains that require context-aware decision-making tailored to individuals. This paper introduces Personalized Causal Graph Reasoning as an agentic framework that enhances LLM reasoning by incorporating personal causal graphs derived from data of individuals. These graphs provide a foundation that guides the LLM's reasoning process. We evaluate it on a case study on nutrient-oriented dietary recommendations, which requires personal reasoning due to the implicit unique dietary effects. We propose a counterfactual evaluation to estimate the efficiency of LLM-recommended foods for glucose management. Results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently provides personalized dietary recommendations to reduce average glucose iAUC across three time windows, which outperforms the previous approach. LLM-as-a-judge evaluation results indicate that our proposed method enhances personalization in the reasoning process.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are widely used, but they often generate subtle factual errors, especially in long-form text. These errors are fatal in some specialized domains such as medicine. Existing fact-checking with grounding documents methods face two main challenges: (1) they struggle to understand complex multihop relations in long documents, often overlooking subtle factual errors; (2) most specialized methods rely on pairwise comparisons, requiring multiple model calls, leading to high resource and computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose GraphCheck, a fact-checking framework that uses extracted knowledge graphs to enhance text representation. Graph Neural Networks further process these graphs as a soft prompt, enabling LLMs to incorporate structured knowledge more effectively. Enhanced with graph-based reasoning, GraphCheck captures multihop reasoning chains that are often overlooked by existing methods, enabling precise and efficient fact-checking in a single inference call. Experimental results on seven benchmarks spanning both general and medical domains demonstrate up to a 7.1% overall improvement over baseline models. Notably, GraphCheck outperforms existing specialized fact-checkers and achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art LLMs, such as DeepSeek-V3 and OpenAI-o1, with significantly fewer parameters.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we identify a critical problem, "lost-in-retrieval", in retrieval-augmented multi-hop question answering (QA): the key entities are missed in LLMs' sub-question decomposition. "Lost-in-retrieval" significantly degrades the retrieval performance, which disrupts the reasoning chain and leads to the incorrect answers. To resolve this problem, we propose a progressive retrieval and rewriting method, namely ChainRAG, which sequentially handles each sub-question by completing missing key entities and retrieving relevant sentences from a sentence graph for answer generation. Each step in our retrieval and rewriting process builds upon the previous one, creating a seamless chain that leads to accurate retrieval and answers. Finally, all retrieved sentences and sub-question answers are integrated to generate a comprehensive answer to the original question. We evaluate ChainRAG on three multi-hop QA datasets - MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and HotpotQA - using three large language models: GPT4o-mini, Qwen2.5-72B, and GLM-4-Plus. Empirical results demonstrate that ChainRAG consistently outperforms baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency.

  People worldwide use language in subtle and complex ways to express emotions. Although emotion recognition--an umbrella term for several NLP tasks--impacts various applications within NLP and beyond, most work in this area has focused on high-resource languages. This has led to significant disparities in research efforts and proposed solutions, particularly for under-resourced languages, which often lack high-quality annotated datasets. In this paper, we present BRIGHTER--a collection of multilabeled, emotion-annotated datasets in 28 different languages and across several domains. BRIGHTER primarily covers low-resource languages from Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America, with instances labeled by fluent speakers. We highlight the challenges related to the data collection and annotation processes, and then report experimental results for monolingual and crosslingual multi-label emotion identification, as well as emotion intensity recognition. We analyse the variability in performance across languages and text domains, both with and without the use of LLMs, and show that the BRIGHTER datasets represent a meaningful step towards addressing the gap in text-based emotion recognition.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) risk retaining unauthorized or sensitive information from their training data, which raises privacy concerns. LLM unlearning seeks to mitigate these risks by selectively removing specified data while maintaining overall model performance. However, most existing work focus on methods to achieve effective forgetting and does not provide a detailed analysis of the retain set, the portion of training data that is not targeted for removal. In this paper, we investigate the effects of unlearning on various subsets of the retain set through a case study on entity unlearning. We introduce the Syntactically Similar Neighbor Set, a group of queries that share similar syntactic structures with the data targeted for removal, and show that this subset suffers the greatest performance drop during unlearning. Moreover, when used for regularization, this set not only preserves performance on syntactically similar queries but also delivers comparable or improved results across other data subsets. Our results highlight that syntactic similarity is a critical factor, potentially more so than domain or entity relationships, in achieving effective and practical LLM unlearning.

  Textual Concept Bottleneck Models (TCBMs) are interpretable-by-design models for text classification that predict a set of salient concepts before making the final prediction. This paper proposes Complete Textual Concept Bottleneck Model (CT-CBM), a novel TCBM generator building concept labels in a fully unsupervised manner using a small language model, eliminating both the need for predefined human labeled concepts and LLM annotations. CT-CBM iteratively targets and adds important and identifiable concepts in the bottleneck layer to create a complete concept basis. CT-CBM achieves striking results against competitors in terms of concept basis completeness and concept detection accuracy, offering a promising solution to reliably enhance interpretability of NLP classifiers.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A large body of research has found substantial gender bias in NLP systems. Most of this research takes a binary, essentialist view of gender: limiting its variation to the categories _men_ and _women_, conflating gender with sex, and ignoring different sexual identities. But gender and sexuality exist on a spectrum, so in this paper we study the biases of large language models (LLMs) towards sexual and gender minorities beyond binary categories. Grounding our study in a widely used social psychology model -- the Stereotype Content Model -- we demonstrate that English-language survey questions about social perceptions elicit more negative stereotypes of sexual and gender minorities from both humans and LLMs. We then extend this framework to a more realistic use case: text generation. Our analysis shows that LLMs generate stereotyped representations of sexual and gender minorities in this setting, showing that they amplify representational harms in creative writing, a widely advertised use for LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge Editing (KE) aims to adjust a Large Language Model's (LLM) internal representations and parameters to correct inaccuracies and improve output consistency without incurring the computational expense of re-training the entire model. However, editing commonsense knowledge still faces difficulties, including limited knowledge coverage in existing resources, the infeasibility of annotating labels for an overabundance of commonsense knowledge, and the strict knowledge formats of current editing methods. In this paper, we address these challenges by presenting ConceptEdit, a framework that integrates conceptualization and instantiation into the KE pipeline for LLMs to enhance their commonsense reasoning capabilities. ConceptEdit dynamically diagnoses implausible commonsense knowledge within an LLM using another verifier LLM and augments the source knowledge to be edited with conceptualization for stronger generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs enhanced with ConceptEdit successfully generate commonsense knowledge with improved plausibility compared to other baselines and achieve stronger performance across multiple question answering benchmarks. Our data, code, and models are publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-context LLMs are increasingly in demand for applications such as retrieval-augmented generation. To defray the cost of pretraining LLMs over long contexts, recent work takes an approach of synthetic context extension: fine-tuning LLMs with synthetically generated long-context data in a post-training stage. However, it remains unclear how and why this synthetic context extension imparts abilities for downstream long-context tasks. In this paper, we investigate fine-tuning on synthetic data for three long-context tasks that require retrieval and reasoning. We vary the realism of "needle" concepts to be retrieved and diversity of the surrounding "haystack" context, from using LLMs to construct synthetic documents to using templated relations and creating symbolic datasets. We find that models trained on synthetic data fall short of the real data, but surprisingly, the mismatch can be interpreted and even predicted in terms of a special set of attention heads that are responsible for retrieval over long context, retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2024). The retrieval heads learned on synthetic data have high overlap with retrieval heads learned on real data, and there is a strong correlation between the recall of heads learned and the downstream performance of a model. Furthermore, with attention knockout and activation patching, we mechanistically show that retrieval heads are necessary and explain model performance, although they are not totally sufficient. Our results shed light on how to interpret synthetic data fine-tuning performance and how to approach creating better data for learning real-world capabilities over long contexts.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate multilingual abilities, yet they are English-centric due to dominance of English in training corpora. The limited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge. Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specific knowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whether code-switching can 'activate', or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoning when LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specific domains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource language tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities, but they still struggle with faithful reasoning due to knowledge gaps and hallucinations. To address these issues, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been utilized to enhance LLM reasoning through their structured knowledge. However, existing KG-enhanced methods, either retrieval-based or agent-based, encounter difficulties in accurately retrieving knowledge and efficiently traversing KGs at scale. In this work, we introduce graph-constrained reasoning (GCR), a novel framework that bridges structured knowledge in KGs with unstructured reasoning in LLMs. To eliminate hallucinations, GCR ensures faithful KG-grounded reasoning by integrating KG structure into the LLM decoding process through KG-Trie, a trie-based index that encodes KG reasoning paths. KG-Trie constrains the decoding process, allowing LLMs to directly reason on graphs and generate faithful reasoning paths grounded in KGs. Additionally, GCR leverages a lightweight KG-specialized LLM for graph-constrained reasoning alongside a powerful general LLM for inductive reasoning over multiple reasoning paths, resulting in accurate reasoning with zero reasoning hallucination. Extensive experiments on several KGQA benchmarks demonstrate that GCR achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong zero-shot generalizability to unseen KGs without additional training.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Demographics and cultural background of annotators influence the labels they assign in text annotation -- for instance, an elderly woman might find it offensive to read a message addressed to a "bro", but a male teenager might find it appropriate. It is therefore important to acknowledge label variations to not under-represent members of a society. Two research directions developed out of this observation in the context of using large language models (LLM) for data annotations, namely (1) studying biases and inherent knowledge of LLMs and (2) injecting diversity in the output by manipulating the prompt with demographic information. We combine these two strands of research and ask the question to which demographics an LLM resorts to when no demographics is given. To answer this question, we evaluate which attributes of human annotators LLMs inherently mimic. Furthermore, we compare non-demographic conditioned prompts and placebo-conditioned prompts (e.g., "you are an annotator who lives in house number 5") to demographics-conditioned prompts ("You are a 45 year old man and an expert on politeness annotation. How do you rate {instance}"). We study these questions for politeness and offensiveness annotations on the POPQUORN data set, a corpus created in a controlled manner to investigate human label variations based on demographics which has not been used for LLM-based analyses so far. We observe notable influences related to gender, race, and age in demographic prompting, which contrasts with previous studies that found no such effects.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Author profiling is the task of inferring characteristics about individuals by analyzing content they share. Supervised machine learning still dominates automatic systems that perform this task, despite the popularity of prompting large language models to address natural language understanding tasks. One reason is that the classification instances consist of large amounts of posts, potentially a whole user profile, which may exceed the input length of Transformers. Even if a model can use a large context window, the entirety of posts makes the application of API-accessed black box systems costly and slow, next to issues which come with such "needle-in-the-haystack" tasks. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a new method for author profiling which aims at distinguishing relevant from irrelevant content first, followed by the actual user profiling only with relevant data. To circumvent the need for relevance-annotated data, we optimize this relevance filter via reinforcement learning with a reward function that utilizes the zero-shot capabilities of large language models. We evaluate our method for Big Five personality trait prediction on two Twitter corpora. On publicly available real-world data with a skewed label distribution, our method shows similar efficacy to using all posts in a user profile, but with a substantially shorter context. An evaluation on a version of these data balanced with artificial posts shows that the filtering to relevant posts leads to a significantly improved accuracy of the predictions.

  This paper empirically investigates the relationship between subword vocabulary size and the performance of large language models (LLMs) to provide insights on how to define the vocabulary size. Experimental results show that larger vocabulary sizes lead to better performance in LLMs. Moreover, we consider a continual training scenario where a pre-trained language model is trained on a different target language. We introduce a simple method to use a new vocabulary instead of the pre-defined one. We show that using the new vocabulary outperforms the model with the vocabulary used in pre-training.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent empirical results have sparked a debate about whether or not Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of Theory of Mind (ToM). While some have found LLMs to be successful on ToM evaluations such as the False Belief task, others have shown that their performance is not robust against trivial alterations to stimuli. In this paper, we introduce SCALPEL -- a technique to incrementally modify stimuli to test different specific hypotheses about why LLMs fail -- and apply this method to the "transparent-access" modification of the unexpected contents task. Our results suggest that LLMs often do poorly because they fail to make essential common-sense inferences, such as that seeing a transparent container implies recognizing its contents. We conclude that while modern LLMs go beyond mere pattern matching, they still fall short of robust human-like ToM. We argue that SCALPEL can help cognitive scientists examine LLMs' capabilities in finer detail and provide insight into alternative mechanisms by which tasks that are used to assess human cognition might be completed.

  Embodied planning requires agents to make coherent multi-step decisions based on dynamic visual observations and natural language goals. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale, including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.

  Language model pretraining with next token prediction has proved effective for scaling compute but is limited to the amount of available training data. Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new axis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques, multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalities -- e.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista -- matching OpenAI's o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning results -- e.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBench -- outperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by a large margin (up to +550%).

  With large language models (LLMs) demonstrating remarkable capabilities, there has been a surge in research on leveraging LLMs to build general-purpose multi-modal agents. However, existing approaches either rely on computationally expensive end-to-end training using large-scale multi-modal data or adopt tool-use methods that lack the ability to continuously learn and adapt to new environments. In this paper, we introduce EHC, a general agent capable of learning without parameter updates. EHC consists of a Hierarchical Memory Retrieval (HMR) module and a Task-Category Oriented Experience Learning (TOEL) module. The HMR module facilitates rapid retrieval of relevant memories and continuously stores new information without being constrained by memory capacity. The TOEL module enhances the agent's comprehension of various task characteristics by classifying experiences and extracting patterns across different categories. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that EHC outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance and underscoring its effectiveness as a general agent for handling complex multi-modal tasks.

  Recent research has highlighted that Large Language Models (LLMs), even when trained to generate extended long reasoning steps, still face significant challenges on hard reasoning problems. However, much of the existing literature relies on direct prompting with simple in-context learning examples for evaluation, which largely overlooks advanced techniques to elicit LLMs' deliberate reasoning before drawing conclusions that LLMs hit a performance ceiling. In this paper, we systematically explore the combined potential of in-context search and test-time scaling on super hard reasoning tasks. We find that by employing advanced in-context search prompting to LLMs augmented with internal scaling, one can achieve transformative performance breakthroughs on tasks previously deemed "unsolvable" (e.g., reported success rates below 5%). We provide both empirical results and theoretical analysis of how this combination can unleash LLM reasoning capabilities: i) Empirically, on controlled NP-hard tasks and complex real-world planning benchmarks, our approach achieves up to a 30x improvement in success rates compared to previously reported results without any external mechanisms; ii) Theoretically, we show that in-context search prompting, when combined with internal scaling, significantly extends the complexity class of solvable reasoning problems. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about the limitations of LLMs on complex tasks, indicating that current evaluation paradigms systematically underestimate their true potential. Our work calls for a critical reassessment of how LLM reasoning is benchmarked and a more robust evaluation strategy that fully captures the true capabilities of contemporary LLMs, which can lead to a better understanding of their operational reasoning boundaries in real-world deployments.

  Safety reasoning is a recent paradigm where LLMs reason over safety policies before generating responses, thereby mitigating limitations in existing safety measures such as over-refusal and jailbreak vulnerabilities. However, implementing this paradigm is challenging due to the resource-intensive process of creating high-quality policy-embedded chain-of-thought (CoT) datasets while ensuring reasoning remains accurate and free from hallucinations or policy conflicts. To tackle this, we propose AIDSAFE: Agentic Iterative Deliberation for Safety Reasoning, a novel data generation recipe that leverages multi-agent deliberation to iteratively expand reasoning on safety policies. A data refiner stage in AIDSAFE ensures high-quality outputs by eliminating repetitive, redundant, and deceptive thoughts. AIDSAFE-generated CoTs provide a strong foundation for supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based safety training. Additionally, to address the need of preference data in alignment stages, such as DPO training, we introduce a supplemental recipe that uses belief augmentation to create distinct selected and rejected CoT samples. Our evaluations demonstrate that AIDSAFE-generated CoTs achieve superior policy adherence and reasoning quality. Consequently, we show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on these CoTs can significantly improve safety generalization and jailbreak robustness while maintaining acceptable utility and over-refusal accuracy. AIDSAFE-generated CoT datasets can be found here:this https URL

  Recent advances such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek R1 have demonstrated the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). While open-source replication efforts have primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, methods and resources for developing general reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. This gap is partly due to the challenge of collecting diverse and verifiable reasoning data suitable for RL. We hypothesize that logical reasoning is critical for developing general reasoning capabilities, as logic forms a fundamental building block of reasoning. In this work, we present SynLogic, a data synthesis framework and dataset that generates diverse logical reasoning data at scale, encompassing 35 diverse logical reasoning tasks. The SynLogic approach enables controlled synthesis of data with adjustable difficulty and quantity. Importantly, all examples can be verified by simple rules, making them ideally suited for RL with verifiable rewards. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of RL training on the SynLogic dataset based on 7B and 32B models. SynLogic leads to state-of-the-art logical reasoning performance among open-source datasets, surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B by 6 points on BBEH. Furthermore, mixing SynLogic data with mathematical and coding tasks improves the training efficiency of these domains and significantly enhances reasoning generalization. Notably, our mixed training model outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks. These findings position SynLogic as a valuable resource for advancing the broader reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We open-source both the data synthesis pipeline and the SynLogic dataset atthis https URL.

  Recent studies have investigated whether large language models (LLMs) can support obscure communication that requires specialized skills, such as inferring subtext or doublespeak. To conduct the investigation, researchers have used social deduction games (SDGs) as their experimental environment, in which players conceal and infer specific information. However, prior work has often overlooked how LLMs should be evaluated in such settings. Specifically, we point out two issues with the evaluation methods they employed. First, metrics used in prior studies are coarse-grained as they are based on overall game outcomes that often fail to capture event-level behaviors; Second, error analyses have lacked structured methodologies capable of producing insights that meaningfully support evaluation outcomes. To address these issues, we propose a macroscopic and systematic approach to the investigation. Specifically, we introduce seven fine-grained metrics that resolve the first issue. To tackle the second issue, we conducted a thematic analysis and identified four major reasoning failures that undermine LLMs' performance in obscured communication.

  The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has highlighted critical challenges in cross-vendor service discovery, interoperability, and communication. Existing protocols like model context protocol and agent-to-agent protocol have made significant strides in standardizing interoperability between agents and tools, as well as communication among multi-agents. However, there remains a lack of standardized protocols and solutions for service discovery across different agent and tool vendors. In this paper, we propose AgentDNS, a root domain naming and service discovery system designed to enable LLM agents to autonomously discover, resolve, and securely invoke third-party agent and tool services across organizational and technological boundaries. Inspired by the principles of the traditional DNS, AgentDNS introduces a structured mechanism for service registration, semantic service discovery, secure invocation, and unified billing. We detail the architecture, core functionalities, and use cases of AgentDNS, demonstrating its potential to streamline multi-agent collaboration in real-world scenarios.

  Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have popularized Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT), a strategy that encourages deliberate and step-by-step reasoning before producing a final answer. While LCoTs have enabled expert-level performance in complex tasks, how the internal structures of their reasoning chains drive, or even predict, the correctness of final answers remains a critical yet underexplored question. In this work, we present LCoT2Tree, an automated framework that converts sequential LCoTs into hierarchical tree structures and thus enables deeper structural analysis of LLM reasoning. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), we reveal that structural patterns extracted by LCoT2Tree, including exploration, backtracking, and verification, serve as stronger predictors of final performance across a wide range of tasks and models. Leveraging an explainability technique, we further identify critical thought patterns such as over-branching that account for failures. Beyond diagnostic insights, the structural patterns by LCoT2Tree support practical applications, including improving Best-of-N decoding effectiveness. Overall, our results underscore the critical role of internal structures of reasoning chains, positioning LCoT2Tree as a powerful tool for diagnosing, interpreting, and improving reasoning in LLMs.

  The alignment between humans and machines is a critical challenge in artificial intelligence today. Reinforcement learning, which aims to maximize a reward function, is particularly vulnerable to the risks associated with poorly designed reward functions. Recent advancements has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) for reward generation can outperform human performance in this context. We introduce VIRAL, a pipeline for generating and refining reward functions through the use of multi-modal LLMs. VIRAL autonomously creates and interactively improves reward functions based on a given environment and a goal prompt or annotated image. The refinement process can incorporate human feedback or be guided by a description generated by a video LLM, which explains the agent's policy in video form. We evaluated VIRAL in five Gymnasium environments, demonstrating that it accelerates the learning of new behaviors while ensuring improved alignment with user intent.

  Since the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), efforts have largely focused on improving their instruction-following and deductive reasoning abilities, leaving open the question of whether these models can truly discover new knowledge. In pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI), there is a growing need for models that not only execute commands or retrieve information but also learn, reason, and generate new knowledge by formulating novel hypotheses and theories that deepen our understanding of the world. Guided by Peirce's framework of abduction, deduction, and induction, this survey offers a structured lens to examine LLM-based hypothesis discovery. We synthesize existing work in hypothesis generation, application, and validation, identifying both key achievements and critical gaps. By unifying these threads, we illuminate how LLMs might evolve from mere ``information executors'' into engines of genuine innovation, potentially transforming research, science, and real-world problem solving.

  Do LLMs robustly generalize critical safety facts to novel situations? Lacking this ability is dangerous when users ask naive questions. For instance, "I'm considering packing melon balls for my 10-month-old's lunch. What other foods would be good to include?" Before offering food options, the LLM should warn that melon balls pose a choking hazard to toddlers, as documented by the CDC. Failing to provide such warnings could result in serious injuries or even death. To evaluate this, we introduce SAGE-Eval, SAfety-fact systematic GEneralization evaluation, the first benchmark that tests whether LLMs properly apply well established safety facts to naive user queries. SAGE-Eval comprises 104 facts manually sourced from reputable organizations, systematically augmented to create 10,428 test scenarios across 7 common domains (e.g., Outdoor Activities, Medicine). We find that the top model, Claude-3.7-sonnet, passes only 58% of all the safety facts tested. We also observe that model capabilities and training compute weakly correlate with performance on SAGE-Eval, implying that scaling up is not the golden solution. Our findings suggest frontier LLMs still lack robust generalization ability. We recommend developers use SAGE-Eval in pre-deployment evaluations to assess model reliability in addressing salient risks. We publicly release SAGE-Eval atthis https URLand our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While recent success of large reasoning models (LRMs) significantly advanced LLMs' reasoning capability by optimizing the final answer accuracy using reinforcement learning, they may also drastically increase the output length due to overthinking, characterized by unnecessarily complex reasoning paths that waste computation and potentially degrade the performance. We hypothesize that such inefficiencies stem from LRMs' limited capability to dynamically select the proper modular reasoning strategies, termed thinking patterns at the right position. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose a dynamic optimization framework that segments model-generated reasoning paths into distinct thinking patterns, systematically identifying and promoting beneficial patterns that improve the answer while removing detrimental ones. Empirical analysis confirms that our optimized thinking paths yield more concise yet sufficiently informative trajectories, enhancing reasoning efficiency by reducing attention FLOPs by up to 47% while maintaining accuracy for originally correct responses. Moreover, a non-trivial portion of originally incorrect responses are transformed into correct ones, achieving a 15.6% accuracy improvement with reduced length. Motivated by the improvement brought by the optimized thinking paths, we apply a preference optimization technique supported by a pairwise dataset contrasting suboptimal and optimal reasoning paths. Experimental evaluations across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks reveal that our method notably reduces computational overhead while simultaneously improving reasoning accuracy, achieving up to a 12% accuracy improvement and reducing token usage from approximately 5,000 to 3,000 tokens.

  In over sixty years since its inception, the field of planning has made significant contributions to both the theory and practice of building planning software that can solve a never-before-seen planning problem. This was done through established practices of rigorous design and evaluation of planning systems. It is our position that this rigor should be applied to the current trend of work on planning with large language models. One way to do so is by correctly incorporating the insights, tools, and data from the automated planning community into the design and evaluation of LLM-based planners. The experience and expertise of the planning community are not just important from a historical perspective; the lessons learned could play a crucial role in accelerating the development of LLM-based planners. This position is particularly important in light of the abundance of recent works that replicate and propagate the same pitfalls that the planning community has encountered and learned from. We believe that avoiding such known pitfalls will contribute greatly to the progress in building LLM-based planners and to planning in general.

  Optimization modeling is fundamental to decision-making across diverse domains. Despite progress in automating optimization formulation from natural language descriptions, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to generate formally correct and usable models against hallucinations, posing a challenge for reliable automation. Inspired by the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in enhancing Large Reasoning Models, we present Solver-Informed Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), a novel framework that significantly improves the authenticity of LLMs for optimization modeling using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward by leveraging external optimization solvers as verifiers. These verifiers automatically assess the executable code and the instance-level mathematical model represented by the associated LP file, yielding precise and comprehensive feedback signals -- including syntax, feasibility, and solution quality, serving as direct rewards for the RL process. This automated verification process, particularly from classic optimization solvers, also underpins our instance-enhanced self-consistency method to synthesize high-quality training data. Extensive experiments on diverse public benchmarks demonstrate that SIRL achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing methods in generating accurate and executable optimization models.

  This study critically distinguishes between AI Agents and Agentic AI, offering a structured conceptual taxonomy, application mapping, and challenge analysis to clarify their divergent design philosophies and capabilities. We begin by outlining the search strategy and foundational definitions, characterizing AI Agents as modular systems driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Image Models (LIMs) for narrow, task-specific automation. Generative AI is positioned as a precursor, with AI Agents advancing through tool integration, prompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements. In contrast, Agentic AI systems represent a paradigmatic shift marked by multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and orchestrated autonomy. Through a sequential evaluation of architectural evolution, operational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, we present a comparative analysis across both paradigms. Application domains such as customer support, scheduling, and data summarization are contrasted with Agentic AI deployments in research automation, robotic coordination, and medical decision support. We further examine unique challenges in each paradigm including hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination failure and propose targeted solutions such as ReAct loops, RAG, orchestration layers, and causal modeling. This work aims to provide a definitive roadmap for developing robust, scalable, and explainable AI agent and Agentic AI-driven systems. >AI Agents, Agent-driven, Vision-Language-Models, Agentic AI Decision Support System, Agentic-AI Applications

  Personalized multiple clustering aims to generate diverse partitions of a dataset based on different user-specific aspects, rather than a single clustering. It has recently drawn research interest for accommodating varying user preferences. Recent approaches primarily use CLIP embeddings with proxy learning to extract representations biased toward user clustering preferences. However, CLIP primarily focuses on coarse image-text alignment, lacking a deep contextual understanding of user interests. To overcome these limitations, we propose an agent-centric personalized clustering framework that leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as agents to comprehensively traverse a relational graph to search for clusters based on user interests. Due to the advanced reasoning mechanism of MLLMs, the obtained clusters align more closely with user-defined criteria than those obtained from CLIP-based representations. To reduce computational overhead, we shorten the agents' traversal path by constructing a relational graph using user-interest-biased embeddings extracted by MLLMs. A large number of weakly connected edges can be filtered out based on embedding similarity, facilitating an efficient traversal search for agents. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves NMI scores of 0.9667 and 0.9481 on the Card Order and Card Suits benchmarks, respectively, largely improving the SOTA model by over 140%.

  Inductive reasoning, a cornerstone of human cognition, enables generalization from limited data but hasn't yet been fully achieved by large language models (LLMs). While modern LLMs excel at reasoning tasks, their ability to maintain stable and consistent rule abstraction under imperfect observations remains underexplored. To fill this gap, in this work, we introduce Robust Rule Induction, a task that evaluates LLMs' capability in inferring rules from data that are fused with noisy examples. To address this task, we further propose Sample-steered Rule Refinement (SRR), a method enhancing reasoning stability via observation diversification and execution-guided feedback. Experiments across arithmetic, cryptography, and list functions reveal: (1) SRR outperforms other methods with minimal performance degradation under noise; (2) Despite slight accuracy variation, LLMs exhibit instability under noise (e.g., 0% accuracy change with only 70% consistent score); (3) Counterfactual task gaps highlight LLMs' reliance on memorized patterns over genuine abstraction. Our findings challenge LLMs' reasoning robustness, revealing susceptibility to hypothesis drift and pattern overfitting, while providing empirical evidence critical for developing human-like inductive systems.

  While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities as zero-shot planners for embodied agents, their inability to learn from experience and build persistent mental models limits their robustness in complex open-world environments like Minecraft. We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.

  Large language models (LLMs) are being used to solve planning problems that require search. Most of the literature uses LLMs as world models to define the search space, forgoing soundness for the sake of flexibility. A recent work, Thought of Search (ToS), proposed defining the search space with code, having LLMs produce that code. ToS requires a human in the loop, collaboratively producing a sound successor function and goal test. The result, however, is worth the effort: all the tested datasets were solved with 100% accuracy. Consequently, there is great potential to automate the ToS process. We take a first major step towards automating ToS (AutoToS), taking the human out of the loop of interactions with the language model. AutoToS guides the language model step by step towards the generation of sound and complete search components, through feedback from both generic and domain specific unit tests. We show that AutoToS is able to achieve 100% accuracy on all the evaluated domains with a small number of LLM calls.
