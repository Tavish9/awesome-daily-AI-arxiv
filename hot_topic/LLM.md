- **[RoboTron-Sim: Improving Real-World Driving via Simulated Hard-Case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04642)**  `arXiv:2508.04642`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  Collecting real-world data for rare high-risk scenarios, long-tailed driving events, and complex interactions remains challenging, leading to poor performance of existing autonomous driving systems in these critical situations. In this paper, we propose RoboTron-Sim that improves real-world driving in critical situations by utilizing simulated hard cases. First, we develop a simulated dataset called Hard-case Augmented Synthetic Scenarios (HASS), which covers 13 high-risk edge-case categories, as well as balanced environmental conditions such as day/night and sunny/rainy. Second, we introduce Scenario-aware Prompt Engineering (SPE) and an Image-to-Ego Encoder (I2E Encoder) to enable multimodal large language models to effectively learn real-world challenging driving skills from HASS, via adapting to environmental deviations and hardware differences between real-world and simulated scenarios. Extensive experiments on nuScenes show that RoboTron-Sim improves driving performance in challenging scenarios by around 50%, achieving state-of-the-art results in real-world open-loop planning. Qualitative results further demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboTron-Sim in better managing rare high-risk driving scenarios. Project page:this https URL

  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled richer perceptual grounding for code policy generation in embodied agents. However, most existing systems lack effective mechanisms to adaptively monitor policy execution and repair codes during task completion. In this work, we introduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that systematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual monitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for embodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system first decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program grounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed in simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected checkpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure reasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events with VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and repairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting program synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that HyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of robot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating multimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines.

- **[\textit{RoboTron-Nav}: A Unified Framework for Embodied Navigation Integrating Perception, Planning, and Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18525)**  `arXiv:2503.18525`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yufeng Zhong, Chengjian Feng, Feng Yan, Fanfan Liu, Liming Zheng, Lin Ma_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In language-guided visual navigation, agents locate target objects in unseen environments using natural language instructions. For reliable navigation in unfamiliar scenes, agents should possess strong perception, planning, and prediction capabilities. Additionally, when agents revisit previously explored areas during long-term navigation, they may retain irrelevant and redundant historical perceptions, leading to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose \textbf{RoboTron-Nav}, a unified framework that integrates {p}erception, {p}lanning, and {p}rediction capabilities through multitask collaborations on navigation and embodied question answering tasks, thereby enhancing navigation performances. Furthermore, RoboTron-Nav employs an adaptive 3D-aware history sampling strategy to effectively and efficiently utilize historical observations. By leveraging large language model, RoboTron-Nav comprehends diverse commands and complex visual scenes, resulting in appropriate navigation actions. RoboTron-Nav achieves an 81.1\% success rate in object goal navigation on the $\mathrm{CHORES}$-$\mathbb{S}$ benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art performance.

- **[LTLCodeGen: Code Generation of Syntactically Correct Temporal Logic for Robot Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07902)**  `arXiv:2503.07902`  `cs.RO`  
  _Behrad Rabiei, Mahesh Kumar A.R., Zhirui Dai, Surya L.S.R. Pilla, Qiyue Dong, Nikolay Atanasov_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper focuses on planning robot navigation tasks from natural language specifications. We develop a modular approach, where a large language model (LLM) translates the natural language instructions into a linear temporal logic (LTL) formula with propositions defined by object classes in a semantic occupancy map. The LTL formula and the semantic occupancy map are provided to a motion planning algorithm to generate a collision-free robot path that satisfies the natural language instructions. Our main contribution is LTLCodeGen, a method to translate natural language to syntactically correct LTL using code generation. We demonstrate the complete task planning method in real-world experiments involving human speech to provide navigation instructions to a mobile robot. We also thoroughly evaluate our approach in simulated and real-world experiments in comparison to end-to-end LLM task planning and state-of-the-art LLM-to-LTL translation methods.

- **[Causal Reflection with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04495)**  `arXiv:2508.04495`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Abi Aryan, Zac Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation, enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners, but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt, self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.

- **[Automatically Interpreting Millions of Features in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13928)**  `arXiv:2410.13928`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Gon√ßalo Paulo, Alex Mallen, Caden Juang, Nora Belrose_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While the activations of neurons in deep neural networks usually do not have a simple human-understandable interpretation, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can be used to transform these activations into a higher-dimensional latent space which may be more easily interpretable. However, these SAEs can have millions of distinct latent features, making it infeasible for humans to manually interpret each one. In this work, we build an open-source automated pipeline to generate and evaluate natural language explanations for SAE features using LLMs. We test our framework on SAEs of varying sizes, activation functions, and losses, trained on two different open-weight LLMs. We introduce five new techniques to score the quality of explanations that are cheaper to run than the previous state of the art. One of these techniques, intervention scoring, evaluates the interpretability of the effects of intervening on a feature, which we find explains features that are not recalled by existing methods. We propose guidelines for generating better explanations that remain valid for a broader set of activating contexts, and discuss pitfalls with existing scoring techniques. We use our explanations to measure the semantic similarity of independently trained SAEs, and find that SAEs trained on nearby layers of the residual stream are highly similar. Our large-scale analysis confirms that SAE latents are indeed much more interpretable than neurons, even when neurons are sparsified using top-$k$ postprocessing. Our code is available atthis https URL, and our explanations are available atthis https URL.

  Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic modalities in clinical practice, encompassing a broad spectrum of diagnostic tasks. Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of reasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to enhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing multimodal models predominantly rely on "one-time" diagnostic approaches, lacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse rewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose CX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved "think-answer" reasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and verifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an instruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148 samples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points supervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic reasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain diagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the need for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain MLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment, achieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable CXR-specific models. On real-world clinical dataset (Rui-CXR), CX-Mind achieves a mean recall@1 across 14 diseases that substantially surpasses the second-best results, with multi-center expert evaluations further confirming its clinical utility across multiple dimensions.

- **[COPO: Consistency-Aware Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04138)**  `arXiv:2508.04138`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Jinghang Han, Jiawei Chen, Hang Shao, Hao Ma, Mingcheng Li, Xintian Shen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the introduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging rule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions and guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across many replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or incorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to vanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for learning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization framework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome consistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs show high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives meaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and self-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we incorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances local advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic transitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method introduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization strategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed framework's robustness and general applicability.

- **[GTPO: Trajectory-Based Policy Optimization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03772)**  `arXiv:2508.03772`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

- **[Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19143)**  `arXiv:2506.19143`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Paul C. Bogdan, Uzay Macar, Neel Nanda, Arthur Conmy_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which identified "broadcasting" sentences that receive disproportionate attention from all future sentences via "receiver" attention heads; (3) a causal attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an open-source tool (this http URL) for visualizing the outputs of our methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models.

- **[Tool Unlearning for Tool-Augmented LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01083)**  `arXiv:2502.01083`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Jiali Cheng, Hadi Amiri_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are often trained on datasets of query-response pairs, which embed the ability to use tools or APIs directly into the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Tool-augmented LLMs need the ability to forget learned tools due to security vulnerabilities, privacy regulations, or tool deprecations. However, ``tool unlearning'' has not been investigated in unlearning literature. We introduce this novel task, which requires addressing distinct challenges compared to traditional unlearning: knowledge removal rather than forgetting individual samples, the high cost of optimizing LLMs, and the need for principled evaluation metrics. To bridge these gaps, we propose ToolDelete, the first approach for unlearning tools from tool-augmented LLMs. It implements three key properties to address the above challenges for effective tool unlearning and introduces a new membership inference attack (MIA) model for effective evaluation. Extensive experiments on multiple tool learning datasets and tool-augmented LLMs show that ToolDelete effectively unlearns randomly selected tools, while preserving the LLM's knowledge on non-deleted tools and maintaining performance on general tasks.

- **[Automatic LLM Red Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04451)**  `arXiv:2508.04451`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Roman Belaire, Arunesh Sinha, Pradeep Varakantham_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Red teaming is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and building trust in current LLMs. However, current automated methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on brittle prompt templates or single-turn attacks, failing to capture the complex, interactive nature of real-world adversarial dialogues. We propose a novel paradigm: training an AI to strategically `break' another AI. By formalizing red teaming as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employing a hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we effectively address the inherent sparse reward and long-horizon challenges. Our generative agent learns coherent, multi-turn attack strategies through a fine-grained, token-level harm reward, enabling it to uncover subtle vulnerabilities missed by existing baselines. This approach sets a new state-of-the-art, fundamentally reframing LLM red teaming as a dynamic, trajectory-based process (rather than a one-step test) essential for robust AI deployment.

- **[Enhancing Vision-Language Model Training with Reinforcement Learning in Synthetic Worlds for Real-World Success](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04280)**  `arXiv:2508.04280`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _George Bredis, Stanislav Dereka, Viacheslav Sinii, Ruslan Rakhimov, Daniil Gavrilov_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Interactive multimodal agents must convert raw visual observations into coherent sequences of language-conditioned actions -- a capability that current vision-language models (VLMs) still lack. Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL) efforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom tested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training simulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on dense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce Vision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), a lightweight, hyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens while learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our knowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple decoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable convergence. Training a single VLM with VL-DAC in one inexpensive simulator at a time (MiniWorld, Gym-Cards, ALFWorld, or WebShop) already produces policies that generalize widely: +50\% relative on BALROG (game-centric agentic control), +5\% relative on the hardest part of VSI-Bench (spatial planning), and +2\% on VisualWebBench (web navigation), all without degrading general image understanding accuracy. These results provide the first evidence that a simple RL algorithm can train VLMs entirely in cheap synthetic worlds while delivering measurable gains on real-image agentic, spatial-reasoning, and web-navigation benchmarks.

- **[Empowering Time Series Forecasting with LLM-Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04231)**  `arXiv:2508.04231`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Chin-Chia Michael Yeh, Vivian Lai, Uday Singh Saini, Xiran Fan, Yujie Fan, Junpeng Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM) powered agents have emerged as effective planners for Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems. While most existing AutoML approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight models can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. This observation led us to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for time series forecasting.

- **[Dynamic User-controllable Privacy-preserving Few-shot Sensing Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03989)**  `arXiv:2508.03989`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Ajesh Koyatan Chathoth, Shuhao Yu, Stephen Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  User-controllable privacy is important in modern sensing systems, as privacy preferences can vary significantly from person to person and may evolve over time. This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously collect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user behaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor data, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large quantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user agency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable, few-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework. PrivCLIP allows users to specify and modify their privacy preferences by categorizing activities as sensitive (black-listed), non-sensitive (white-listed), or neutral (gray-listed). Leveraging a multimodal contrastive learning approach, PrivCLIP aligns IMU sensor data with natural language activity descriptions in a shared embedding space, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities. When a privacy-sensitive activity is identified, the system uses a language-guided activity sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to transform the original data into a privacy-compliant version that semantically resembles a non-sensitive activity. We evaluate PrivCLIP on multiple human activity recognition datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of both privacy protection and data utility.

- **[Latent Knowledge Scalpel: Precise and Massive Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03741)**  `arXiv:2508.03741`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Xin Liu, Qiyang Song, Shaowen Xu, Kerou Zhou, Wenbo Jiang, Xiaoqi Jia, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often retain inaccurate or outdated information from pre-training, leading to incorrect predictions or biased outputs during inference. While existing model editing methods can address this challenge, they struggle with editing large amounts of factual information simultaneously and may compromise the general capabilities of the models. In this paper, our empirical study demonstrates that it is feasible to edit the internal representations of LLMs and replace the entities in a manner similar to editing natural language inputs. Based on this insight, we introduce the Latent Knowledge Scalpel (LKS), an LLM editor that manipulates the latent knowledge of specific entities via a lightweight hypernetwork to enable precise and large-scale editing. Experiments conducted on Llama-2 and Mistral show even with the number of simultaneous edits reaching 10,000, LKS effectively performs knowledge editing while preserving the general abilities of the edited LLMs. Code is available at:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM): an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated training datasets.

  _Dahun Kim, Anelia Angelova_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, a novel approach to enrich semantic representations in vision-language contrastive learning. Unlike standard CLIP-style models that rely on a single text embedding, our method introduces multiple structured prompts, each containing a distinct adaptive token that captures diverse semantic aspects of the input text. We leverage a pretrained LLM as the text encoder within the CLIP framework, processing all prompts jointly in a single forward pass. The resulting prompt embeddings are combined into a unified text representation, enabling semantically richer alignment with visual features. To further promote semantic diversity and representation quality, we incorporate a diversity regularization loss and a negation-aware loss, encouraging specialization across prompts and improving contrastive discrimination. Our method achieves consistent improvements on both image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.

  _Jiaqi Zhao, Miao Zhang, Ming Wang, Yuzhang Shang, Kaihao Zhang, Weili Guan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer severe performance degradation when facing extremely low-bit (sub 2-bit) quantization. Several existing sub 2-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) methods utilize a mix-precision scheme by leveraging an unstructured fine-grained mask to explicitly distinguish salient weights, while which introduces an extra 1-bit or more per weight. To explore the real limit of PTQ, we propose an extremely low-bit PTQ method called PTQ1.61, which enables weight quantization to 1.61-bit for the first time. Specifically, we first introduce a one-dimensional structured mask with negligibly additional 0.0002-bit per weight based on input activations from the perspective of reducing the upper bound of quantization error to allocate corresponding salient weight channels to 4-bit. For non-salient channels binarization, an efficient block-wise scaling factors optimization framework is then presented to take implicit row-wise correlations and angular biases into account. Different from prior works that concentrate on adjusting quantization methodologies, we further propose a novel paradigm called quantization preprocessing, where we argue that transforming the weight distribution of the pretrained model before quantization can alleviate the difficulty in per-channel extremely low-bit PTQ. Extensive experiments indicate our PTQ1.61 achieves state-of-the-art performance in extremely low-bit quantization. Codes are available atthis https URL.

- **[CARD: Cache-Assisted Parallel Speculative Decoding for Efficient Large Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04462)**  `arXiv:2508.04462`  `cs.LG`  
  _Enyu Zhou, Kai Sheng, Hao Chen, Xin He_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model first provides multiple draft tokens and the original target model then verifies these tokens in parallel, has shown great power for LLM inference acceleration. However, existing SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which forces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD, resulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the draft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is rejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be discarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we propose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a 'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and verification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared cache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's generation direction. This effectively enables the target model to perform inference at speed approaching that of the draft model. Our approach achieves up to 4.83 speedup over vanilla decoding without requiring fine-tuning of either the draft or target models. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[FlexQ: Efficient Post-training INT6 Quantization for LLM Serving via Algorithm-System Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04405)**  `arXiv:2508.04405`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance but entail significant memory and computational costs, restricting their practical deployment. While existing INT4/INT8 quantization reduces these costs, they often degrade accuracy or lack optimal efficiency. INT6 quantization offers a superior trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency, but lacks hardware support in modern GPUs, forcing emulation via higher-precision arithmetic units that limit acceleration.In this paper, we propose FlexQ, a novel post-training INT6 quantization framework combining algorithmic innovation with system-level optimizations. FlexQ employs uniform 6-bit weight quantization across all layers, with adaptive retention of 8-bit activations in layers identified through layer-wise sensitivity analysis. To maximize hardware efficiency, we develop a specialized high-performance GPU kernel supporting matrix multiplication for W6A6 and W6A8 representations via Binary Tensor Core (BTC) equivalents, effectively bypassing the lack of native INT6 tensor cores. Evaluations on LLaMA models show FlexQ maintains near-FP16 accuracy, with perplexity increases of no more than 0.05. The proposed kernel achieves an average 1.39$\times$ speedup over ABQ-LLM on LLaMA-2-70B linear layers. End-to-end, FlexQ delivers 1.33$\times$ inference acceleration and 1.21$\times$ memory savings over SmoothQuant. Code is released atthis https URL.

- **[Forgetting: A New Mechanism Towards Better Large Language Model Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04329)**  `arXiv:2508.04329`  `cs.LG`  
  _Ali Taheri Ghahrizjani, Alireza Taban, Qizhou Wang, Shanshan Ye, Abdolreza Mirzaei, Tongliang Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a critical role for pretrained large language models (LLMs), notably enhancing their capacity to acquire domain-specific knowledge while preserving or potentially augmenting their general-purpose capabilities. However, the efficacy of SFT hinges on data quality as well as data volume, otherwise it may result in limited performance gains or even degradation relative to the associated baselines. To mitigate such reliance, we suggest categorizing tokens within each corpus into two parts -- positive and negative tokens -- based on whether they are useful to improve model performance. Positive tokens can be trained in common ways, whereas negative tokens, which may lack essential semantics or be misleading, should be explicitly forgotten. Overall, the token categorization facilitate the model to learn less informative message, and the forgetting process shapes a knowledge boundary to guide the model on what information to learn more precisely. We conduct experiments on well-established benchmarks, finding that this forgetting mechanism not only improves overall model performance and also facilitate more diverse model responses.

  Large language models (LLMs) are now being used with increasing frequency as chat bots, tasked with the summarizing information or generating text and code in accordance with user instructions. The rapid increase in reasoning capabilities and inference speed of LLMs has revealed their remarkable potential for applications extending beyond the domain of chat bots to general machine learning tasks. This work is conducted out of the curiosity about such potential. In this work, we propose a framework Mockingbird to adapt LLMs to general machine learning tasks and evaluate its performance and scalability on several general machine learning tasks. The core concept of this framework is instructing LLMs to role-play functions and reflect on its mistakes to improve itself. Our evaluation and analysis result shows that LLM-driven machine learning methods, such as Mockingbird, can achieve acceptable results on common machine learning tasks; however, solely reflecting on its own currently cannot outperform the effect of domain-specific documents and feedback from human experts.

  Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) seeks to model temporal dynamics among variables to predict future trends. Transformer-based models and large language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and patterns. However, current methods often rely on rigid inductive biases, ignore intervariable interactions, or apply static fusion strategies that limit adaptability across forecast horizons. These limitations create bottlenecks in capturing nuanced, horizon-specific relationships in time-series data. To solve this problem, we propose T3Time, a novel trimodal framework consisting of time, spectral, and prompt branches, where the dedicated frequency encoding branch captures the periodic structures along with a gating mechanism that learns prioritization between temporal and spectral features based on the prediction horizon. We also proposed a mechanism which adaptively aggregates multiple cross-modal alignment heads by dynamically weighting the importance of each head based on the features. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average reduction of 3.28% in MSE and 2.29% in MAE. Furthermore, it shows strong generalization in few-shot learning settings: with 5% training data, we see a reduction in MSE and MAE by 4.13% and 1.91%, respectively; and with 10% data, by 3.62% and 1.98% on average.

  Research to improve Automated Short Answer Grading has recently focused on Large Language Models (LLMs) with prompt engineering and no- or few-shot prompting to achieve best results. This is in contrast to the fine-tuning approach, which has historically required large-scale compute clusters inaccessible to most users. New closed-model approaches such as OpenAI's fine-tuning service promise results with as few as 100 examples, while methods using open weights such as quantized low-rank adaptive (QLORA) can be used to fine-tune models on consumer GPUs. We evaluate both of these fine-tuning methods, measuring their interaction with few-shot prompting for automated short answer grading (ASAG) with structured (JSON) outputs. Our results show that finetuning with small amounts of data has limited utility for Llama open-weight models, but that fine-tuning methods can outperform few-shot baseline instruction-tuned LLMs for OpenAI's closed models. While our evaluation set is limited, we find some evidence that the observed benefits of finetuning may be impacted by the domain subject matter. Lastly, we observed dramatic improvement with the LLama 3.1 8B-Instruct open-weight model by seeding the initial training examples with a significant amount of cheaply generated synthetic training data.

  Despite the success of the monolithic dense paradigm of large language models (LLMs), the LoRA adapters offer an efficient solution by fine-tuning small task-specific modules and merging them with the base model. However, in multi-task settings, merging LoRA adapters trained on heterogeneous sources frequently causes \textit{task interference}, degrading downstream performance. To address this, we propose a tensorized clustered LoRA (TC-LoRA) library targeting to address the task interference at the \textit{text-level} and \textit{parameter-level}. At the \textit{text-level}, we cluster the training samples in the embedding space to capture input-format similarities, then train a specialized LoRA adapter for each cluster. At the \textit{parameter-level}, we introduce a joint Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition that disentangles task-specific and shared factors across LoRA adapters. This joint factorization preserves essential knowledge while reducing cross-task interference. Extensive experiments on out-of-domain zero-shot and skill-composition tasks-including reasoning, question answering, and coding. Compared to strong SVD-based baselines, TC-LoRA achieves +1.4\% accuracy on Phi-3 and +2.3\% on Mistral-7B (+2.3\%), demonstrating the effectiveness of TC-LoRA in LLM adaptation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The specification of prior distributions is fundamental in Bayesian inference, yet it remains a significant bottleneck. The prior elicitation process is often a manual, subjective, and unscalable task. We propose a novel framework which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and scale this process. We introduce \texttt{LLMPrior}, a principled operator that translates rich, unstructured contexts such as natural language descriptions, data or figures into valid, tractable probability distributions. We formalize this operator by architecturally coupling an LLM with an explicit, tractable generative model, such as a Gaussian Mixture Model (forming a LLM based Mixture Density Network), ensuring the resulting prior satisfies essential mathematical properties. We further extend this framework to multi-agent systems where Logarithmic Opinion Pooling is employed to aggregate prior distributions induced by decentralized knowledge. We present the federated prior aggregation algorithm, \texttt{Fed-LLMPrior}, for aggregating distributed, context-dependent priors in a manner robust to agent heterogeneity. This work provides the foundation for a new class of tools that can potentially lower the barrier to entry for sophisticated Bayesian modeling.

  _Zuxin Ma, Yunhe Cui, Yongbin Qin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large Language Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering lower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing non-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g., layer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt to scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical bottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further limits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning policies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning Framework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design dependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports real-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable to static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and real-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can evaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative optimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can generate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to 33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods, outperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor achieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction error < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1 minute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52 seconds), achieving over 64 times speedup.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing post-training quantization methods for large language models (LLMs) offer remarkable success. However, the increasingly marginal performance gains suggest that existing quantization strategies are insufficient to support the development of more compressed models. To inspire new directions for future research, this paper introduces the concept of null space into LLMs quantization. We argue that the quantization error can be effectively alleviated by constraining the post-quantization weight perturbation to lie within the null space of input activations. To prove this idea, we propose a plug-and-play null space projection module for existing milestone PTQ baselines named Q2N. Specifically, we first design an efficient and accurate null space projection approximation method tailored to the characteristics of LLMs. Subsequently, we theoretically derive a closed-form solution for an equivalent vector of the obtained projection matrix, which satisfies practical inference condition while avoiding additional memory overhead. Extensive experiments are conducted on various state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) and baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of both our Q2N and the perspective of null space optimization for LLMs quantization. We view this paper the first step to further alleviate the quantization error based on the insights of null space, hoping it inspiring future researchers to design more advanced quantization methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Selecting a sample generation scheme from multiple prompt-based generative models, including large language models (LLMs) and prompt-guided image and video generation models, is typically addressed by choosing the model that maximizes an averaged evaluation score. However, this score-based selection overlooks the possibility that different models achieve the best generation performance for different types of text prompts. An online identification of the best generation model for various input prompts can reduce the costs associated with querying sub-optimal models. In this work, we explore the possibility of varying rankings of text-based generative models for different text prompts and propose an online learning framework to predict the best data generation model for a given input prompt. The proposed PAK-UCB algorithm addresses a contextual bandit (CB) setting with shared context variables across the arms, utilizing the generated data to update kernel-based functions that predict the score of each model available for unseen text prompts. Additionally, we leverage random Fourier features (RFF) to accelerate the online learning process of PAK-UCB. Our numerical experiments on real and simulated text-to-image and image-to-text generative models show that RFF-UCB performs successfully in identifying the best generation model across different sample types.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control under delayed rewards is an under-explored problem despite its significance in real-world applications. Many complex skills are based on intermediate ones as prerequisites. For instance, a humanoid locomotor must learn how to stand before it can learn to walk. To cope with delayed reward, an agent must perform deep exploration. However, existing deep exploration methods are designed for small discrete action spaces, and their generalization to state-of-the-art continuous control remains unproven. We address the deep exploration problem for the first time from a PAC-Bayesian perspective in the context of actor-critic learning. To do this, we quantify the error of the Bellman operator through a PAC-Bayes bound, where a bootstrapped ensemble of critic networks represents the posterior distribution, and their targets serve as a data-informed function-space prior. We derive an objective function from this bound and use it to train the critic ensemble. Each critic trains an individual soft actor network, implemented as a shared trunk and critic-specific heads. The agent performs deep exploration by acting epsilon-softly on a randomly chosen actor head. Our proposed algorithm, named {\it PAC-Bayesian Actor-Critic (PBAC)}, is the only algorithm to consistently discover delayed rewards on continuous control tasks with varying difficulty.

  Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. In this paper, we propose p-MoD, an efficient MLLM architecture that significantly reduces training and inference costs while maintaining model performance. The majority of computation in MLLMs stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer-based LLM. Accordingly, we leverage the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each LLM layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layers and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. Extensive experiments on two baseline models across 15 benchmarks show that our model matches or even surpasses the performance of corresponding baselines, while requiring only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.7% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.

  Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various domains; however, their ability to comprehend driving scenes remains less proven. The complexity of driving scenarios, which includes multi-view information, poses significant challenges for existing MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce NuPlanQA-Eval, a multi-view, multi-modal evaluation benchmark for driving scene understanding. To further support generalization to multi-view driving scenarios, we also propose NuPlanQA-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 1M real-world visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. For context-aware analysis of traffic scenes, we categorize our dataset into nine subtasks across three core skills: Road Environment Perception, Spatial Relations Recognition, and Ego-Centric Reasoning. Furthermore, we present BEV-LLM, integrating Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features from multi-view images into MLLMs. Our evaluation results reveal key challenges that existing MLLMs face in driving scene-specific perception and spatial reasoning from ego-centric perspectives. In contrast, BEV-LLM demonstrates remarkable adaptability to this domain, outperforming other models in six of the nine subtasks. These findings highlight how BEV integration enhances multi-view MLLMs while also identifying key areas that require further refinement for effective adaptation to driving scenes. To facilitate further research, we publicly release NuPlanQA atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs. Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD) segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding.

  The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation. Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX (Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps, eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

  Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) aims to answer questions by explicitly reading and reasoning about the text involved in a video. Most works in this field follow a frame-level framework which suffers from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, resulting in limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the Video TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel model termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result for each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is designed to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and textual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation. Then, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an instance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish spatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer. Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework. GAT outperforms existing Video TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large language models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses the previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\% in accuracy and achieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models.

  Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12 FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

  Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding, their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction. Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost.

  Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$ contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples. Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements, demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical chart editing systems.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues, we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly visual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements in the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities.

  Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams. Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

To fill this gap, we propose the DOcument Grounding and Referring data engine (DOGR-Engine), which generates two types of high-quality fine-grained document data: (1) multi-granular parsing data to improve text localization and recognition, and (2) instruction-tuning data to activate MLLMs' grounding and referring capabilities in dialogue and reasoning. Using the DOGR-Engine, we construct DOGR-Bench, a benchmark covering seven grounding and referring tasks across three document types (chart, poster, and PDF document), offering a comprehensive evaluation of fine-grained document understanding. Leveraging the generated data, we further develop DOGR, a strong baseline model that excels in text localization and recognition, while precisely grounds and refers to key textual information during conversation and reasoning, thereby advancing document understanding to a finer granularity and enable flexible interaction paradigms.

  Learning action models from real-world human-centric interaction datasets is important towards building general-purpose intelligent assistants with efficiency. However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts. Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI agents in the physical world.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have experienced significant advancements in recent years. However, their performance still falls short in tasks requiring deep visual perception, such as identifying subtle differences between images. A potential cause is the scarcity of visual knowledge in popular instruction-tuning corpora, resulting in inadequate visual perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a self-improvement framework grounded in a novel visual knowledge-intensive task, \underline{C}ausality-driven \underline{V}isual object \underline{C}ompletion (CVC). This task requires LVLMs to infer the masked object in an image based on its \textit{causal} relationships with the other visible information. We first obtain rich examples cheaply through our automated instance construction pipeline, without relying on sophisticated LVLMs (\textit{e.g.}, GPT-4V) or human assistance. Then, LVLMs effectively self-improve through trial and error learning using these created instances. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains across four challenging specialized tasks and four widely-used comprehensive benchmarks. Especially on specialized tasks, our method achieves an average improvement of 5.4\% and 4.0\% compared to the corresponding baselines when utilizing LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively.

  The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video scenarios. All code, data and model weight will be made publicly available.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs' context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile, building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge Video-MLLMs.

  The security of biomedical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has attracted increasing attention. However, training samples easily contain private information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect, potentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment. An intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content and retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant computational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning has emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by selectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while preserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no available datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection in biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built upon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic private data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets two key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is mistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally respond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where wrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset, leading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning Efficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance across different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med and find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful knowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement. This work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising field.

  There have been attempts to create large-scale structures in vision models similar to LLM, such as ViT-22B. While this research has provided numerous analyses and insights, our understanding of its practical utility remains incomplete. Therefore, we examine how this model structure reacts and train in a local environment. We also highlight the instability in training and make some model modifications to stabilize it. The ViT-22B model, trained from scratch, overall outperformed ViT in terms of performance under the same parameter size. Additionally, we venture into the task of image generation, which has not been attempted in ViT-22B. We propose an image generation architecture using ViT and investigate which between ViT and ViT-22B is a more suitable structure for image generation.

  While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, their application to specialized anomaly detection (AD) remains constrained by domain adaptation challenges. Existing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based approaches suffer from two critical limitations: inadequate training data utilization when models produce uniform responses, and insufficient supervision over reasoning processes that encourage immediate binary decisions without deliberative analysis. We propose a comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic innovations. First, we introduce a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process that guides models from region identification to focused examination, generating diverse response patterns essential for GRPO optimization while enabling structured supervision over analytical workflows. Second, we develop a fine-grained reward mechanism incorporating classification accuracy and localization supervision, transforming binary feedback into continuous signals that distinguish genuine analytical insight from spurious correctness. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple industrial datasets demonstrates substantial performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models to specialized anomaly detection. Our method achieves superior accuracy with efficient adaptation of existing annotations, effectively bridging the gap between general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual discrimination required for detecting subtle manufacturing defects and structural irregularities.

  Occlusion perception, a critical foundation for human-level spatial understanding, embodies the challenge of integrating visual recognition and reasoning. Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual question answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion perception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically coherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon this foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five tailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive evaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a significant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find, cannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further identify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias, a fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We believe O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion perception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual intelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper publication.

  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have witnessed remarkable growth, showcasing formidable capabilities in handling intricate multimodal tasks with exceptional performance. Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language models to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile reasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability Evaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed premises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced LMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect flawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on explicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects performance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with surface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws. Modality trust varies-Gemini 2.5 pro and Claude Sonnet 4 balance visual and textual info, while aya-vision-8b over-rely on text in conflicts. These insights underscore the urgent need to enhance LMMs' proactive verification of input validity and shed novel insights into mitigating the problem. The code is available atthis https URL.

  The performance of machine learning models for automated invoice processing is critically dependent on large-scale, diverse datasets. However, the acquisition of such datasets is often constrained by privacy regulations and the high cost of manual annotation. To address this, we present a novel pipeline for generating high-fidelity, synthetic invoice documents and their corresponding structured data. Our method first utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the text content and precise spatial layout from a source invoice. Select data fields are then replaced with contextually realistic, synthetic content generated by a large language model (LLM). Finally, we employ an inpainting technique to erase the original text from the image and render the new, synthetic text in its place, preserving the exact layout and font characteristics. This process yields a pair of outputs: a visually realistic new invoice image and a perfectly aligned structured data file (JSON) reflecting the synthetic content. Our approach provides a scalable and automated solution to amplify small, private datasets, enabling the creation of large, varied corpora for training more robust and accurate document intelligence models.

  Memes are popular in the modern world and are distributed primarily for entertainment. However, harmful ideologies such as misogyny can be propagated through innocent-looking memes. The detection and understanding of why a meme is misogynous is a research challenge due to its multimodal nature (image and text) and its nuanced manifestations across different societal contexts. We introduce a novel multimodal approach, \textit{namely}, \textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} to detect, categorize, and explain misogynistic content in memes. \textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} processes text and image modalities separately and unifies them into a multimodal context through a cross-attention mechanism. The resulting multimodal context is then easily processed for labeling, categorization, and explanation via a classifier and Large Language Model (LLM). The evaluation of the proposed model is performed on a newly curated dataset (\textit{\textbf{W}hat's \textbf{B}eneath \textbf{M}isogynous \textbf{S}tereotyping (WBMS)}) created by collecting misogynous memes from cyberspace and categorizing them into four categories, \textit{namely}, Kitchen, Leadership, Working, and Shopping. The model not only detects and classifies misogyny, but also provides a granular understanding of how misogyny operates in domains of life. The results demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to existing methods. The code and dataset are available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

  Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings. In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks: perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin, and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with 8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and 4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

  The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution. Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective, still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon publication.

  The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited, resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules: (1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions, FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

  Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval, especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood, introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM), which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text. Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks, our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4 R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors.

  Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space, can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced, boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score, effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly surpasses existing methods, and the code is available atthis https URL.

  As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks, demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS dataset will be released soon.

  The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) framework has become a widely used approach for multimodal representation learning, particularly in image-text retrieval and clustering. However, its efficacy is constrained by three key limitations: (1) text token truncation, (2) isolated image-text encoding, and (3) deficient compositionality due to bag-of-words behavior. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in generalized vision-language understanding, their potential for learning transferable multimodal representations remainsthis http URLthis work, we present UniME (Universal Multimodal Embedding), a novel two-stage framework that leverages MLLMs to learn discriminative representations for diverse downstream tasks. In the first stage, we perform textual discriminative knowledge distillation from a powerful LLM-based teacher model to enhance the embedding capability of the MLLM≈õ language component. In the second stage, we introduce hard negative enhanced instruction tuning to further advance discriminative representation learning. Specifically, we initially mitigate false negative contamination and then sample multiple hard negatives per instance within each batch, forcing the model to focus on challenging samples. This approach not only improves discriminative power but also enhances instruction-following ability in downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, including short and long caption retrieval and compositional retrieval. Results demonstrate that UniME achieves consistent performance improvement across all tasks, exhibiting superior discriminative and compositional capabilities.

  A 3D scene graph represents a compact scene model by capturing both the objects present and the semantic relationships between them, making it a promising structure for robotic applications. To effectively interact with users, an embodied intelligent agent should be able to answer a wide range of natural language queries about the surrounding 3D environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) are beneficial solutions for user-robot interaction due to their natural language understanding and reasoning abilities. Recent methods for learning scene representations have shown that adapting these representations to the 3D world can significantly improve the quality of LLM responses. However, existing methods typically rely only on geometric information, such as object coordinates, and overlook the rich semantic relationships between objects. In this work, we propose 3DGraphLLM, a method for constructing a learnable representation of a 3D scene graph that explicitly incorporates semantic relationships. This representation is used as input to LLMs for performing 3D vision-language tasks. In our experiments on popular ScanRefer, Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, Sqa3D, and Scan2cap datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms baselines that do not leverage semantic relationships between objects.

  Diffusion models have been recognized for their ability to generate images that are not only visually appealing but also of high artistic quality. As a result, Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation has been proposed to leverage region-specific positions and descriptions to enable more precise and controllable generation. However, previous methods primarily focus on UNet-based models (\eg SD1.5 and SDXL), and limited effort has explored Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs), which have demonstrated powerful image generation capabilities. Enabling MM-DiT for layout-to-image generation seems straightforward but is challenging due to the complexity of how layout is introduced, integrated, and balanced among multiple modalities. To this end, we explore various network variants to efficiently incorporate layout guidance into MM-DiT, and ultimately present SiamLayout. To inherit the advantages of MM-DiT, we use a separate set of network weights to process the layout, treating it as equally important as the image and text modalities. Meanwhile, to alleviate the competition among modalities, we decouple the image-layout interaction into a siamese branch alongside the image-text one and fuse them in the later stage. Moreover, we contribute a large-scale layout dataset, named LayoutSAM, which includes 2.7 million image-text pairs and 10.7 million entities. Each entity is annotated with a bounding box and a detailed description. We further construct the LayoutSAM-Eval benchmark as a comprehensive tool for evaluating the L2I generation quality. Finally, we introduce the Layout Designer, which taps into the potential of large language models in layout planning, transforming them into experts in layout generation and optimization. These components form CreatiLayout -- a systematic solution that integrates the layout model, dataset, and planner for creative layout-to-image generation.

  Medical phrase grounding is crucial for identifying relevant regions in medical images based on phrase queries, facilitating accurate image analysis and diagnosis. However, current methods rely on manual extraction of key phrases from medical reports, reducing efficiency and increasing the workload for clinicians. Additionally, the lack of model confidence estimation limits clinical trust and usability. In this paper, we introduce a novel task called Medical Report Grounding (MRG), which aims to directly identify diagnostic phrases and their corresponding grounding boxes from medical reports in an end-to-end manner. To address this challenge, we propose uMedGround, a robust and reliable framework that leverages a multimodal large language model to predict diagnostic phrases by embedding a unique token, <BOX>, into the vocabulary to enhance detection capabilities. A vision encoder-decoder processes the embedded token and input image to generate grounding boxes. Critically, uMedGround incorporates an uncertainty-aware prediction model, significantly improving the robustness and reliability of grounding predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that uMedGround outperforms state-of-the-art medical phrase grounding methods and fine-tuned large visual-language models, validating its effectiveness and reliability. This study represents a pioneering exploration of the MRG task, marking the first-ever endeavor in this domain. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability of uMedGround in medical visual question answering and class-based localization tasks, where it highlights visual evidence aligned with key diagnostic phrases, supporting clinicians in interpreting various types of textual inputs, including free-text reports, visual question answering queries, and class labels.

  Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) aims to assign texts to structured label hierarchies; however, it faces challenges due to data scarcity and model complexity. This study explores the feasibility of using black box Large Language Models (LLMs) accessed via APIs for HTC, as an alternative to traditional machine learning methods that require extensive labeled data and computational resources. We evaluate three prompting strategies -- Direct Leaf Label Prediction (DL), Direct Hierarchical Label Prediction (DH), and Top-down Multi-step Hierarchical Label Prediction (TMH) -- in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of these strategies. Experiments on two datasets show that a few-shot setting consistently improves classification accuracy compared to a zero-shot setting. While a traditional machine learning model achieves high accuracy on a dataset with a shallow hierarchy, LLMs, especially DH strategy, tend to outperform the machine learning model on a dataset with a deeper hierarchy. API costs increase significantly due to the higher input tokens required for deeper label hierarchies on DH strategy. These results emphasize the trade-off between accuracy improvement and the computational cost of prompt strategy. These findings highlight the potential of black box LLMs for HTC while underscoring the need to carefully select a prompt strategy to balance performance and cost.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a milestone in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. However, their large-scale deployment remains constrained by the need for significant computational resources. This work proposes starting from a base model to explore and combine data processing and careful data selection techniques, training strategies, and architectural adjustments to improve the efficiency of LLMs in resource-constrained environments and within a delimited knowledge base. The methodological approach included defining criteria for building reliable datasets, conducting controlled experiments with different configurations, and systematically evaluating the resulting variants in terms of capability, versatility, response time, and safety. Finally, comparative tests were conducted to measure the performance of the developed variants and to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. This work is based on the master's thesis in Systems and Computer Engineering titled "Efficient Strategy for Improving the Capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)".

  Deploying Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices for long-sequence tasks remains challenging due to the quadratic time complexity of self-attention and growing Key-Value (KV) cache demands. While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may degrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT. However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization (PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and cache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks show that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining efficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large transformer-based language models dominate modern NLP, yet our understanding of how they encode linguistic information is rooted in studies of early models like BERT and GPT-2. To better understand today's language models, we investigate how 25 models - from classical architectures (BERT, DeBERTa, GPT-2) to modern large language models (Pythia, OLMo-2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.1) - represent lexical identity and inflectional morphology across six typologically diverse languages. Using linear and nonlinear classifiers trained on hidden activations, we predict word lemmas and inflectional features layer by layer. We find that models concentrate lexical information linearly in early layers and increasingly nonlinearly in later layers, while keeping inflectional information uniformly accessible and linearly separable throughout. Additional experiments probe the nature of these encodings: attention and residual analyses examine where within layers information can be recovered, steering vector experiments test what information can be functionally manipulated, and intrinsic dimensionality analyses explore how the representational structure evolves across layers. Remarkably, these encoding patterns emerge across all models we test, despite differences in architecture, size, and training regime (pretrained and instruction-tuned variants). This suggests that, even with substantial advances in LLM technologies, transformer models organize linguistic information in similar ways, indicating that these properties are important for next token prediction and are learned early during pretraining.

  _Aoi Ito, Kota Dohi, Yohei Kawaguchi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents CLaSP, a novel model for retrieving time-series signals using natural language queries that describe signal characteristics. The ability to search time-series signals based on descriptive queries is essential in domains such as industrial diagnostics, where data scientists often need to find signals with specific characteristics. However, existing methods rely on sketch-based inputs, predefined synonym dictionaries, or domain-specific manual designs, limiting their scalability and adaptability. CLaSP addresses these challenges by employing contrastive learning to map time-series signals to natural language descriptions. Unlike prior approaches, it eliminates the need for predefined synonym dictionaries and leverages the rich contextual knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Using the TRUCE and SUSHI datasets, which pair time-series signals with natural language descriptions, we demonstrate that CLaSP achieves high accuracy in retrieving a variety of time series patterns based on natural language queries.

  Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR), with applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images, suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence, and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on 8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1. Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting, characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and 2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin (TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning. We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks. Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs' capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore, and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies, rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area, existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions. To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5% on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior general-purpose and specialized models.

  Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is a critical challenge in AI research. While methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are widely used, they often rely on large, costly preference datasets. The current work lacks methods for high-quality data selection specifically for preference data. In this work, we introduce a novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference datasets, grounded in the DPO implicit reward mechanism. By selecting preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, which are indicative of more challenging cases, we improve data efficiency and model alignment. Our approach consistently outperforms five strong baselines across multiple datasets and alignment tasks, achieving superior performance with only 10\% of the original data. This principled, efficient selection method offers a promising solution for scaling LLM alignment with limited resources.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin many AI applications, but their static nature makes updating knowledge costly. Model editing offers an efficient alternative by injecting new information through targeted parameter modifications. In particular, meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) methods have demonstrated notable advantages in both editing effectiveness and efficiency. Despite this, we find that MLBME exhibits suboptimal performance in low-data scenarios, and its training efficiency is bottlenecked by the computation of KL divergence. To address these, we propose $\textbf{S}$tep $\textbf{M}$ore $\textbf{Edit}$ ($\textbf{SMEdit}$), a novel MLBME method that adopts $\textbf{M}$ultiple $\textbf{B}$ackpro$\textbf{P}$agation $\textbf{S}$teps ($\textbf{MBPS}$) to improve editing performance under limited supervision and a norm regularization on weight updates to improve training efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets and two LLMs demonstrate that SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines and the MBPS strategy can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance. Our code will be released soon.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and mitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG frameworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the value of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance of domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the review underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate and explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking. These insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy and context-aware language models.

  Personalizing jargon detection and explanation is essential for making technical documents accessible to readers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. However, tailoring models to individual users typically requires substantial annotation efforts and computational resources due to user-specific finetuning. To address this, we present a systematic study of personalized jargon detection, focusing on methods that are both efficient and scalable for real-world deployment. We explore two personalization strategies: (1) lightweight fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on open-source models, and (2) personalized prompting, which tailors model behavior at inference time without retaining. To reflect realistic constraints, we also investigate hybrid approaches that combine limited annotated data with unsupervised user background signals. Our personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 by 21.4% in F1 score and exceeds the best performing oracle baseline by 8.3%. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only 10% of the annotated training data, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained settings. Our study offers the first work to systematically explore efficient, low-resource personalization of jargon detection using open-source language models, offering a practical path toward scalable, user-adaptive NLP system.

  Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process with diverse multimodal tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and honest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to align with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context, ambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for improvement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is to pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches either rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite, which is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In this work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference alignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating instructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more human-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset synthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree Search, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that are closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show that P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and benchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness and efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search strategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.

  Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment. Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g. low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers - and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA), low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT), MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their performance.

  Depression is a widespread mental disorder that affects millions worldwide. While automated depression assessment shows promise, most studies rely on limited or non-clinically validated data, and often prioritize complex model design over real-world effectiveness. In this paper, we aim to unveil the landscape of clinical depression assessment. We introduce C-MIND, a clinical neuropsychiatric multimodal diagnosis dataset collected over two years from real hospital visits. Each participant completes three structured psychiatric tasks and receives a final diagnosis from expert clinicians, with informative audio, video, transcript, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals recorded. Using C-MIND, we first analyze behavioral signatures relevant to diagnosis. We train a range of classical models to quantify how different tasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the effectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform psychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in realistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning process with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score. We aim to build an infrastructure for clinical depression assessment from both data and algorithmic perspectives, enabling C-MIND to facilitate grounded and reliable research for mental healthcare.

  This paper addresses the critical need for scalable and high-quality educational assessment tools within the Malaysian education system. It highlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the significant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment, especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research introduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1 Mathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's GPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain framework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official curriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching plan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess the generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified through a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method. The results demonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded prompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and factual validity. The study further analyzes the trade-offs between the ease of implementation of framework-based RAG and the fine-grained control offered by a manual pipeline. This work presents a validated methodology for generating curriculum-specific educational content in a low-resource language, introduces a symbiotic RAG-QA evaluation technique, and provides actionable insights for the development and deployment of practical EdTech solutions in Malaysia and similar regions.

  The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks has raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired capabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit training. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing the epistemological challenge of "creation without understanding" that characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities, I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This perspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of emergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable these systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual components.

  _Hongze Tan, Jianfei Pan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks. This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.

  Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by converting raw text into structured knowledge graphs, improving both accuracy and explainability. However, GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw text during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated to implant misleading information. Targeting this attack surface, we propose two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph, poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first attack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate vulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding narratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\%, while keeping the poisoned text fluent and natural. The second attack, named Universal KPA (UKPA), exploits linguistic cues such as pronouns and dependency relations to disrupt the structural integrity of the generated graph by altering globally influential words. With fewer than 0.05\% of full text modified, the QA accuracy collapses from 95\% to 50\%. Furthermore, experiments show that state-of-the-art defense methods fail to detect these attacks, highlighting that securing GraphRAG pipelines against knowledge poisoning remains largely unexplored.

  The increasing demand for mental health services has outpaced the availability of real training data to develop clinical professionals, leading to limited support for the diagnosis of depression. This shortage has motivated the development of simulated or virtual patients to assist in training and evaluation, but existing approaches often fail to generate clinically valid, natural, and diverse symptom presentations. In this work, we embrace the recent advanced language models as the backbone and propose a novel clinician-in-the-loop patient simulation pipeline, TalkDep, with access to diversified patient profiles to develop simulated patients. By conditioning the model on psychiatric diagnostic criteria, symptom severity scales, and contextual factors, our goal is to create authentic patient responses that can better support diagnostic model training and evaluation. We verify the reliability of these simulated patients with thorough assessments conducted by clinical professionals. The availability of validated simulated patients offers a scalable and adaptable resource for improving the robustness and generalisability of automatic depression diagnosis systems.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, they may suffer from hallucinations--generating outputs that are semantically inconsistent with the input image or text. Through causal analyses, we find that: (i) hallucinations with omission may arise from the failure to adequately capture essential causal factors, and (ii) hallucinations with fabrication are likely caused by the model being misled by non-causal cues. To address these challenges, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness, which jointly considers both causal sufficiency and causal necessity of tokens. Specifically, we evaluate each token's standalone contribution and counterfactual indispensability to define a token-level causal completeness reward. This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations in MLLMs.

  Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios, lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance across all tasks.

  In this paper, we cover approaches to systematically govern, assess and quantify bias across the complete life cycle of machine learning models, from initial development and validation to ongoing production monitoring and guardrail implementation. Building upon our foundational work on the Bias Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) for Large Language Models, the authors share prevalent bias and fairness related gaps in Large Language Models (LLMs) and discuss data and AI governance framework to address Bias, Ethics, Fairness, and Factuality within LLMs. The data and AI governance approach discussed in this paper is suitable for practical, real-world applications, enabling rigorous benchmarking of LLMs prior to production deployment, facilitating continuous real-time evaluation, and proactively governing LLM generated responses. By implementing the data and AI governance across the life cycle of AI development, organizations can significantly enhance the safety and responsibility of their GenAI systems, effectively mitigating risks of discrimination and protecting against potential reputational or brand-related harm. Ultimately, through this article, we aim to contribute to advancement of the creation and deployment of socially responsible and ethically aligned generative artificial intelligence powered applications.

  Benchmarks for evaluating reasoning among Vision Language Models (VLMs) on several fields and domains are being curated more frequently over the last few years. However these are often monolingual, mostly available in English. Additionally there also is a lack of datasets available in Hindi on tasks apart from comprehension and translation. We introduce GanitBench, a tough benchmark consisting of 1527 vision-only questions covering several topics in Mathematics - available in languages English and Hindi. Collected from two major examinations from India, the JEE Advanced and the CBSE Boards examinations, this benchmark includes questions in the form of images comprising of figures essential to a question as well as text. We evaluate two closed source models for the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings. GPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's highest average accuracy being 38.15%. We also evaluate models through a "Double Lock" constraint, which brings down the performance of the models by considerable margins. We observe that two-shot CoT appears to be a more effective setting under this environment. Performance of the two VLMs also decreases when answering the same questions in the Hindi language. We hope to facilitate the inclusion of languages like Hindi in research through our work.

  Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding, obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens. To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce \emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks.

  Human-generated reward signals are critical for aligning generative models with human preferences, guiding both training and inference-time evaluations. While large language models (LLMs) employed as proxy evaluators, i.e., LLM-as-a-Judge, significantly reduce the costs associated with manual annotations, they typically require extensive modality-specific training data and fail to generalize well across diverse multimodal tasks. In this paper, we propose Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages minimal textual reasoning data to robustly generalize across multiple modalities and evaluation formats. Our core intuition is that structured textual reasoning explanations inherently encode generalizable decision-making patterns, enabling an effective transfer to multimodal judgments, e.g., with images or videos. Empirical results demonstrate that Flex-Judge, despite being trained on significantly fewer text data, achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively trained multimodal evaluators. Notably, Flex-Judge presents broad impact in modalities like molecule, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce, underscoring its practical value in resource-constrained domains. Our framework highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a powerful, cost-effective alternative to traditional annotation-intensive approaches, substantially advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge.

  As our understanding of autism and ableism continues to increase, so does our understanding of ableist language towards autistic people. Such language poses a significant challenge in NLP research due to its subtle and context-dependent nature. Yet, detecting anti-autistic ableist language remains underexplored, with existing NLP tools often failing to capture its nuanced expressions. We present AUTALIC, the first benchmark dataset dedicated to the detection of anti-autistic ableist language in context, addressing a significant gap in the field. The dataset comprises 2,400 autism-related sentences collected from Reddit, accompanied by surrounding context, and is annotated by trained experts with backgrounds in neurodiversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that current language models, including state-of-the-art LLMs, struggle to reliably identify anti-autistic ableism and align with human judgments, underscoring their limitations in this domain. We publicly release AUTALIC along with the individual annotations which serve as a valuable resource to researchers working on ableism, neurodiversity, and also studying disagreements in annotation tasks. This dataset serves as a crucial step towards developing more inclusive and context-aware NLP systems that better reflect diverse perspectives.

  Offering rich contexts to Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown to boost the performance in various tasks, but the resulting longer prompt would increase the computational cost and might exceed the input limit of LLMs. Recently, some prompt compression methods have been suggested to shorten the length of prompts by using language models to generate shorter prompts or by developing computational models to select important parts of original prompt. The generative compression methods would suffer from issues like hallucination, while the selective compression methods have not involved linguistic rules and overlook the global structure of prompt. To this end, we propose a novel selective compression method called PartPrompt. It first obtains a parse tree for each sentence based on linguistic rules, and calculates local information entropy for each node in a parse tree. These local parse trees are then organized into a global tree according to the hierarchical structure such as the dependency of sentences, paragraphs, and sections. After that, the root-ward propagation and leaf-ward propagation are proposed to adjust node values over the global tree. Finally, a recursive algorithm is developed to prune the global tree based on the adjusted node values. The experiments show that PartPrompt receives the state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, metrics, compression ratios, and target LLMs for inference. The in-depth ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of designs in PartPrompt, and other additional experiments also demonstrate its superiority in terms of the coherence of compressed prompts and in the extreme long prompt scenario.

  LLM-powered conversational assistants are often deployed in a one-size-fits-all manner, which fails to accommodate individual user preferences. Recently, LLM personalization -- tailoring models to align with specific user preferences -- has gained increasing attention as a way to bridge this gap. In this work, we specifically focus on a practical yet challenging setting where only a small set of preference annotations can be collected per user -- a problem we define as Personalized Preference Alignment with Limited Data (PPALLI). To support research in this area, we introduce two datasets -- DnD and ELIP -- and benchmark a variety of alignment techniques on them. We further propose FaST, a highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages high-level features automatically discovered from the data, achieving the best overall performance.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves instruction following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from training inefficiency due to inadequate difficulty assessment. Moreover, RLVR is prone to over-optimization, where LLMs exploit verification shortcuts without aligning to the actual intent of user instructions. We introduce Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator}, a framework that wraps RLVR training into a robust and sample-efficient pipeline. It consists of three components: (1) a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel that co-evolves instructions and hybrid verifications, generating progressively more challenging instruction-verification pairs; (2) IntentCheck, a bypass module enforcing intent alignment; and (3) trip wires, a diagnostic mechanism that detects reward hacking via trap instructions, which trigger and capture shortcut exploitation behaviors. Our Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves 87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming larger proprietary models such as GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate substantial improvements on FollowBench while preserving general capabilities. Our trip wires show significant reductions in reward hacking rates. We will release models, code, and data for future research.

  Generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses via representation editing is a promising way for fine-grained output control. However, there exists an inherent trade-off: imposing a distinctive style often degrades truthfulness. Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting style signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the model's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer correctness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse. We attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions in certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that preserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates the style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation space via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables independent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing interference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each subspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to maintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness. We validate our method on multiple styles and languages. Extensive experiments and analyses show that StyliTruth significantly reduces stylization-induced truthfulness collapse and outperforms existing inference-time intervention methods in balancing style adherence with truthfulness.

  Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance, and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines, defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of 1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available atthis https URL.

  Existing benchmarks in e-commerce primarily focus on basic user intents, such as finding or purchasing products. However, real-world users often pursue more complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks, highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Key-Value (KV) cache quantization has become a widely adopted optimization technique for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by reducing KV cache memory usage and mitigating memory-bound constraints. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial token positions. In this work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of attention sinks during inference by examining their role in the cross-layer evolution of extreme activation outliers. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache quantization. Based on our enhanced understanding, we introduce \textit{\textbf{KVSink}}, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N (PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit numerical outliers.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series forecasting is crucial in strategic planning and decision-making across various industries. Traditional forecasting models mainly concentrate on numerical time series data, often overlooking important textual information such as events and news, which can significantly affect forecasting accuracy. While large language models offer a promise for integrating multimodal data, existing single-prompt frameworks struggle to effectively capture the semantics of timestamped text, introducing redundant information that can hinder model performance. To address this limitation, we introduce DP-GPT4MTS (Dual-Prompt GPT2-base for Multimodal Time Series), a novel dual-prompt large language model framework that combines two complementary prompts: an explicit prompt for clear task instructions and a textual prompt for context-aware embeddings from time-stamped data. The tokenizer generates the explicit prompt while the embeddings from the textual prompt are refined through self-attention and feed-forward networks. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse textural-numerical time series datasets demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in time series forecasting. This highlights the significance of incorporating textual context via a dual-prompt mechanism to achieve more accurate time series predictions.

  Sentiment analysis in low-resource, culturally nuanced contexts challenges conventional NLP approaches that assume fixed labels and universal affective expressions. We present a diagnostic framework that treats sentiment as a context-dependent, culturally embedded construct, and evaluate how large language models (LLMs) reason about sentiment in informal, code-mixed WhatsApp messages from Nairobi youth health groups. Using a combination of human-annotated data, sentiment-flipped counterfactuals, and rubric-based explanation evaluation, we probe LLM interpretability, robustness, and alignment with human reasoning. Framing our evaluation through a social-science measurement lens, we operationalize and interrogate LLMs outputs as an instrument for measuring the abstract concept of sentiment. Our findings reveal significant variation in model reasoning quality, with top-tier LLMs demonstrating interpretive stability, while open models often falter under ambiguity or sentiment shifts. This work highlights the need for culturally sensitive, reasoning-aware AI evaluation in complex, real-world communication.

  The pretrained large language models (LLMs) are finetuned with labeled data for better instruction following ability and alignment with human values. In this paper, we study the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning on reasoning tasks and reveal the uncovered over-memorization phenomenon during a specific stage of LLM finetuning. At this stage, the LLMs have excessively memorized training data and exhibit high test perplexity while maintaining good test accuracy. We investigate the conditions that lead to LLM over-memorization and find that training epochs and large learning rates contribute to this issue. Although models with over-memorization demonstrate comparable test accuracy to normal models, they suffer from reduced robustness, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and decreased generation diversity. Our experiments unveil the over-memorization to be broadly applicable across different tasks, models, and finetuning methods. Our research highlights that overparameterized, extensively finetuned LLMs exhibit unique learning dynamics distinct from traditional machine learning models. Based on our observations of over-memorization, we provide recommendations on checkpoint and learning rate selection during finetuning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities but often struggle with complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning, where minor errors in visual perception or logical deduction can lead to complete failure. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer step-by-step supervision, existing multimodal PRMs are limited to being binary verifiers that can identify but not correct errors, offering little explanatory power. To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model (GM-PRM), a novel paradigm that transforms the PRM from a passive judge into an active reasoning collaborator. Instead of a simple scalar score, GM-PRM provides a fine-grained, interpretable analysis of each reasoning step, evaluating its step intent, visual alignment, and logical soundness. More critically, GM-PRM is trained to generate a corrected version of the first erroneous step it identifies. This unique corrective capability enables our new test-time inference strategy, Refined Best-of-N (Refined-BoN). This framework actively enhances solution quality by using the PRM's generated correction to guide the policy model toward a more promising reasoning trajectory, thereby improving the diversity and correctness of the solution pool. We demonstrate that GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal math benchmarks, significantly boosting policy model performance with remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a 20K-sample training dataset. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

  Prior work synthesizes tool-use LLM datasets by first generating a user query, followed by complex tool-use annotations like DFS. This leads to inevitable annotation failures and low efficiency in data generation. We introduce ToolGrad, an agentic framework that inverts this paradigm. ToolGrad first constructs valid tool-use chains through an iterative process guided by textual "gradients", and then synthesizes corresponding user queries. This "answer-first" approach led to ToolGrad-5k, a dataset generated with more complex tool use, lower cost, and 100% pass rate. Experiments show that models trained on ToolGrad-5k outperform those on expensive baseline datasets and proprietary LLMs, even on OOD benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection. Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries) while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior baselines on average.

  _Md Arafat Sultan, Ram√≥n Fernandez Astudillo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite its simplicity and efficacy, the high token expenditure of self-consistency can limit its practical utility. Here we investigate if self-consistency can be made more token-efficient for long chain-of-thought reasoning tasks, while preserving its parallelism, through early hypothesis pruning. Concretely, we generate all solutions in parallel, but periodically prune intermediate hypotheses that are deemed unnecessary based on two lightweight indicators: (a) the model's own confidence in individual hypotheses, and (b) lexical coverage of all current hypotheses by candidate subsets that are under consideration for continued retention. We design a fast weighted set cover algorithm that utilizes the two indicators; our evaluation of five LLMs on three math benchmarks shows that this method can improve token efficiency for all models, by 10-35% in many cases.

  In the era of information overload, personalized news headline generation is crucial for engaging users by tailoring content to their preferences while accurately conveying news facts. Existing methods struggle with effectively capturing complex user interests and ensuring factual consistency, often leading to generic or misleading headlines. Leveraging the unprecedented capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation, we propose Context-Augmented Personalized LLM (CAP-LLM), a novel framework that integrates user preferences and factual consistency constraints into a powerful pre-trained LLM backbone. CAP-LLM features a User Preference Encoder to capture long-term user interests, a Context Injection Adapter to seamlessly integrate these preferences and current article context into the LLM's generation process, and a Fact-Consistency Reinforcement Module employing a novel contrastive loss to mitigate hallucination. Evaluated on the real-world PENS dataset, CAP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. Notably, it significantly improves factual consistency (FactCC of 87.50) over strong baselines like BART (86.67), while simultaneously enhancing personalization (Pc(avg) 2.73, Pc(max) 17.25) and content coverage (ROUGE-1 26.55, ROUGE-2 9.95, ROUGE-L 23.01). Our ablation studies, human evaluations, and sensitivity analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component and the robustness of our approach, demonstrating CAP-LLM's ability to achieve a superior balance between personalization and factual accuracy in news headline generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks such as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability, where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards. Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking. Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17 on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training. Our implementation is publicly available at:this https URL.

  Some Question Answering (QA) systems rely on knowledge bases (KBs) to provide accurate answers. Entity Linking (EL) plays a critical role in linking natural language mentions to KB entries. However, most existing EL methods are designed for long contexts and do not perform well on short, ambiguous user questions in QA tasks. We propose an entity linking agent for QA, based on a Large Language Model that simulates human cognitive workflows. The agent actively identifies entity mentions, retrieves candidate entities, and makes decision. To verify the effectiveness of our agent, we conduct two experiments: tool-based entity linking and QA task evaluation. The results confirm the robustness and effectiveness of our agent.

  Wikipedia, a vast and continuously consulted knowledge base, faces significant challenges in maintaining up-to-date content due to its reliance on manual human editors. Inspired by the vision of continuous knowledge acquisition in NELL and fueled by advances in LLM-based agents, this paper introduces WiNELL, an agentic framework for continuously updating Wikipedia articles. Our approach employs a multi-agent framework to aggregate online information, select new and important knowledge for a target entity in Wikipedia, and then generate precise edit suggestions for human review. Our fine-grained editing models, trained on Wikipedia's extensive history of human edits, enable incorporating updates in a manner consistent with human editing behavior. Our editor models outperform both open-source instruction-following baselines and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in key information coverage and editing efficiency. End-to-end evaluation on high-activity Wikipedia pages demonstrates WiNELL's ability to identify and suggest timely factual updates. This opens up a promising research direction in LLM agents for automatically updating knowledge bases in a never-ending fashion.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse natural language processing tasks but face persistent challenges in inference efficiency due to their autoregressive nature. While speculative decoding and beam sampling offer notable improvements, traditional methods verify draft sequences sequentially without prioritization, leading to unnecessary computational overhead. This work proposes the Hierarchical Verification Tree (HVT), a novel framework that restructures speculative beam decoding by prioritizing high-likelihood drafts and enabling early pruning of suboptimal candidates. Theoretical foundations and a formal verification-pruning algorithm are developed to ensure correctness and efficiency. Integration with standard LLM inference pipelines is achieved without requiring retraining or architecture modification. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets and models demonstrate that HVT consistently outperforms existing speculative decoding schemes, achieving substantial reductions in inference time and energy consumption while maintaining or enhancing output quality. The findings highlight the potential of hierarchical verification strategies as a new direction for accelerating large language model inference.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Representational bias in large language models (LLMs) has predominantly been measured through single-response interactions and has focused on Global North-centric identities like race and gender. We expand on that research by conducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded representational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of identity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about significant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to encourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious and caste representation in the outputs against the actual population distribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and "stickiness" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We find that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups far beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to encourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that representational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased than the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated prompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these biases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be sufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental changes in model development.

  _Haotian Wu, Bo Xu, Yao Shu, Menglin Yang, Chengwei Qin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities through structured and multi-step reasoning. While prior research has primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies, their potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking), a new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two reasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy. Specifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel: one in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of Thinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent, using a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both candidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\% in GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases, resulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer robustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to training-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on out-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the calibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes consistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural thinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between actual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round of thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach. Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising directions for future ICL research in RLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in many applications marks a significant advance in research and practice. However, their complexity and hard-to-understand nature make them vulnerable to attacks, especially jailbreaks designed to produce harmful responses. To counter these threats, developing strong detection methods is essential for the safe and reliable use of LLMs. This paper studies this detection problem using the Contextual Co-occurrence Matrix, a structure recognized for its efficacy in data-scarce environments. We propose a novel method leveraging the latent space characteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for the effective identification of adversarial and jailbreak prompts. Our evaluations show that this approach achieves a notable F1 score of 0.83 using only 0.5% of labeled prompts, which is a 96.6% improvement over baselines. This result highlights the strength of our learned patterns, especially when labeled data is scarce. Our method is also significantly faster, speedup ranging from 2.3 to 128.4 times compared to the baseline models. To support future research and reproducibility, we have made our implementation publicly available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tasks that require character-level reasoning, such as counting or locating characters within words, remain challenging for contemporary language models. A common conjecture is that language models' reliance on subword units, rather than characters, contributes to their struggles with character-level tasks, yet recent studies offer conflicting conclusions about the role of tokenization, leaving its impact unclear. To address this gap, we introduce CharBench, a comprehensive benchmark of character-level tasks that is two orders of magnitude larger than existing alternatives. We evaluate a diverse range of leading open-weight and proprietary models on CharBench and find that it presents a significant challenge to modern LLMs, with an average accuracy of 43.6% and 32.3% on some tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of how intrinsic properties of words and their segmentations into tokens correspond to model performance. For counting tasks, we find that tokenization properties are weakly correlated with correctness, while the length of the queried word and the actual character count play a more significant part. In contrast, for tasks requiring intra-word positional understanding, performance is negatively correlated with the length of the token containing the queried character, suggesting that longer tokens obscure character position information for LLMs. We encourage future work to build on the benchmark and evaluation methodology introduced here as tools for improving model performance on such tasks.

  The advancement of large language models (LLMs) struggles with the scarcity of high-quality, diverse training data. To address this limitation, we propose LinkSyn, a novel knowledge point (KP) graph-based synthesis framework that enables flexible control over discipline and difficulty distributions while balancing KP coverage and popularity. LinkSyn extracts KPs from question-answering (QA) seed data and constructs a KP graph to synthesize diverse QA data from multiple seeds strongly linked by KPs and sampled from graph walks. Specifically, LinkSyn incorporates (1) a knowledge distribution value function to guide the adjustment of path sampling probability and balance KP coverage and popularity during graph walks; (2) diffusion-based synthesis via DeepSeek-R1 by leveraging multiple seeds with dense logical associations along each path; and (3) high-difficulty QA enhancement within given disciplines by flexible difficulty adjustments. By executing LinkSyn, we synthesize LinkQA, a diverse multi-disciplinary QA dataset with 50B tokens. Extensive experiments on Llama-3 8B demonstrate that continual pre-training with LinkQA yields an average improvement of $\mathbf{11.51\%}$ on MMLU and CMMLU, establishing new SOTA results. LinkQA consistently enhances performance across model size and initial FLOPs scales.

  Reinforcement learning-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most rely only on final-answer rewards, overlooking intermediate reasoning quality. This paper analyzes existing RAG reasoning models and identifies three main failure patterns: (1) information insufficiency, meaning the model fails to retrieve adequate support; (2) faulty reasoning, where logical or content-level flaws appear despite sufficient information; and (3) answer-reasoning inconsistency, where a valid reasoning chain leads to a mismatched final answer. We propose TIRESRAG-R1, a novel framework using a think-retrieve-reflect process and a multi-dimensional reward system to improve reasoning and stability. TIRESRAG-R1 introduces: (1) a sufficiency reward to encourage thorough retrieval; (2) a reasoning quality reward to assess the rationality and accuracy of the reasoning chain; and (3) a reflection reward to detect and revise errors. It also employs a difficulty-aware reweighting strategy and training sample filtering to boost performance on complex tasks. Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that TIRESRAG-R1 outperforms prior RAG methods and generalizes well to single-hop tasks. The code and data are available at:this https URL.

  Relation extraction (RE) is a core task in natural language processing. Traditional approaches typically frame RE as a supervised learning problem, directly mapping context to labels-an approach that often suffers from poor out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. Inspired by the workflow of human annotators, we reframe RE as a reasoning task guided by annotation guidelines and introduce R1-RE, the first reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) framework for RE tasks. Our method elicits the reasoning abilities of small language models for annotation tasks, resulting in significantly improved OOD robustness. We evaluate our approach on the public Sem-2010 dataset and a private MDKG dataset. The R1-RE-7B model attains an average OOD accuracy of approximately 70%, on par with leading proprietary models such as GPT-4o. Additionally, our comprehensive analysis provides novel insights into the training dynamics and emergent reasoning behaviors of the RLVR paradigm for RE.

  As evaluation designs of large language models may shape our trajectory toward artificial general intelligence, comprehensive and forward-looking assessment is essential. Existing benchmarks primarily assess static knowledge, while intelligence also entails the ability to rapidly learn from experience. To this end, we advocate for the evaluation of Test-time Learning, the capacity to improve performance in experience-based, reasoning-intensive tasks during test time. In this work, we propose semantic games as effective testbeds for evaluating test-time learning, due to their resistance to saturation and inherent demand for strategic reasoning. We introduce an objective evaluation framework that compares model performance under both limited and cumulative experience settings, and contains four forms of experience representation. To provide a comparative baseline, we recruit eight human participants to complete the same task. Results show that LLMs exhibit measurable test-time learning capabilities; however, their improvements are less stable under cumulative experience and progress more slowly than those observed in humans. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs as general-purpose learning machines, while also revealing a substantial intellectual gap between models and humans, irrespective of how well LLMs perform on static benchmarks.

  Long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has shown great promise in enhancing the emotion understanding performance of large language models (LLMs). However, current fixed-length CoT methods struggle to balance reasoning depth and efficiency. Simple tasks (e.g., sentiment classification) are over-reasoned, while complex tasks (e.g., sarcasm understanding) lack depth. To fill this gap, we present Emotion-o1, an adaptive CoT framework that dynamically adjusts reasoning length based on emotion-task complexity. Emotion-o1 is trained by distilling adaptive CoT patterns from a reasoning-oriented LLM, followed by supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a four-part reward targeting accuracy, brevity, structure, and redundancy. Experimental results on four emotion tasks highlight: (1) Emotion-o1 demonstrates significant improvements over its backbone, with F1 score increases of 10%(Sentiment), 5%(Emotion), 18%(Humor), and 27%(Sarcasm). (2) In sentiment and sarcasm tasks, our 8B model demonstrates superior performance against advanced LLMs, outperforming Grok-3 by 1.1% and Claude-3.7 by 2%. (3) The framework maintains accuracy while reducing reasoning length by 83% compared to OpenAI-o1, demonstrating effective precision-efficiency optimization. Emotion-o1 effectively balances reasoning depth and efficiency for emotion understanding in LLMs.

  In this study, we introduced a new benchmark consisting of a curated dataset and a defined evaluation process to assess the compositional reasoning capabilities of large language models within the chemistry domain. We designed and validated a fully automated pipeline, verified by subject matter experts, to facilitate this task. Our approach integrates OpenAI reasoning models with named entity recognition (NER) systems to extract chemical entities from recent literature, which are then augmented with external knowledge bases to form a comprehensive knowledge graph. By generating multi-hop questions across these graphs, we assess LLM performance in both context-augmented and non-context augmented settings. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models face significant challenges in multi-hop compositional reasoning. The results reflect the importance of augmenting LLMs with document retrieval, which can have a substantial impact on improving their performance. However, even perfect retrieval accuracy with full context does not eliminate reasoning errors, underscoring the complexity of compositional reasoning. This work not only benchmarks and highlights the limitations of current LLMs but also presents a novel data generation pipeline capable of producing challenging reasoning datasets across various domains. Overall, this research advances our understanding of reasoning in computational linguistics.

  The composition of pre-training datasets for large language models (LLMs) remains largely undisclosed, hindering transparency and efforts to optimize data quality, a critical driver of model performance. Current data selection methods, such as natural language quality assessments, diversity-based filters, and classifier-based approaches, are limited by single-dimensional evaluation or redundancy-focused strategies. To address these gaps, we propose four dimensions to evaluate data quality: professionalism, readability, reasoning, and cleanliness. We further introduce Meta-rater,a multi-dimensional data selection method that integrates these dimensions with existing quality metrics through learned optimal weightings. Meta-rater employs proxy models to train a regression model that predicts validation loss, enabling the identification of optimal combinations of quality scores. Experiments demonstrate that Meta-rater doubles convergence speed for 1.3B parameter models and improves downstream task performance by 3.23, with advantages that scale to models as large as 7.2B parameters. Our work establishes that holistic, multi-dimensional quality integration significantly outperforms conventional single-dimension approaches, offering a scalable paradigm for enhancing pre-training efficiency and model capability.

  Recent LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance by integrating deep thinking and complex reasoning during generation. However, the internal mechanisms behind these reasoning processes remain unexplored. We observe reasoning LLMs consistently use vocabulary associated with human reasoning processes. We hypothesize these words correspond to specific reasoning moments within the models' internal mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), a technique for sparse decomposition of neural network activations into human-interpretable features. We introduce ReasonScore, an automatic metric to identify active SAE features during these reasoning moments. We perform manual and automatic interpretation of the features detected by our metric, and find those with activation patterns matching uncertainty, exploratory thinking, and reflection. Through steering experiments, we demonstrate that amplifying these features increases performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks (+2.2%) while producing longer reasoning traces (+20.5%). Using the model diffing technique, we provide evidence that these features are present only in models with reasoning capabilities. Our work provides the first step towards a mechanistic understanding of reasoning in LLMs. Code available atthis https URL

  This work presents a framework for assessing whether large language models (LLMs) encode more factual knowledge in their parameters than what they express in their outputs. While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has clearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal definition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of correct-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This gives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information used to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable token-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge arises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a case study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a closed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode more factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an average relative gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply hidden that a model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to generate it even once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers. This reveals fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs, which (3) put a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated answer sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain inaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they were, we would be guaranteed to rank them first.

  Large Language Models have garnered significant attention for their capabilities in multilingual natural language processing, while studies on risks associated with cross biases are limited to immediate context preferences. Cross-language disparities in reasoning-based recommendations remain largely unexplored, with a lack of even descriptive analysis. This study is the first to address this gap. We test LLM's applicability and capability in providing personalized advice across three key scenarios: university applications, travel, and relocation. We investigate multilingual bias in state-of-the-art LLMs by analyzing their responses to decision-making tasks across multiple languages. We quantify bias in model-generated scores and assess the impact of demographic factors and reasoning strategies (e.g., Chain-of-Thought prompting) on bias patterns. Our findings reveal that local language bias is prevalent across different tasks, with GPT-4 and Sonnet reducing bias for English-speaking countries compared to GPT-3.5 but failing to achieve robust multilingual alignment, highlighting broader implications for multilingual AI agents and applications such as education. \footnote{Code available at:this https URL

  Optical Character Recognition (OCR) plays a crucial role in digitizing historical and multilingual documents, yet OCR errors - imperfect extraction of text, including character insertion, deletion, and substitution can significantly impact downstream tasks like question-answering (QA). In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how OCR-induced noise affects the performance of Multilingual QA Systems. To support this analysis, we introduce a multilingual QA dataset MultiOCR-QA, comprising 50K question-answer pairs across three languages, English, French, and German. The dataset is curated from OCR-ed historical documents, which include different levels and types of OCR noise. We then evaluate how different state-of-the-art Large Language models (LLMs) perform under different error conditions, focusing on three major OCR error types. Our findings show that QA systems are highly prone to OCR-induced errors and perform poorly on noisy OCR text. By comparing model performance on clean versus noisy texts, we provide insights into the limitations of current approaches and emphasize the need for more noise-resilient QA systems in historical digitization contexts.

  _Yue Zhou, Yi Chang, Yuan Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model merging aims to integrate multiple task-specific models into a unified model that inherits the capabilities of the task-specific models, without additional training. Existing model merging methods often lack consideration of the varying contribution ratios of different task-specific models to the final merged model. In this paper, we propose Mixup Model Merge (M3), a simple yet effective method inspired by the randomized linear interpolation strategy from the Mixup data augmentation technique. M3 performs randomized linear interpolation in parameter space between two task-specific LLMs, where interpolation coefficients are sampled from a Beta distribution to explore diverse contribution ratios. This controllable randomness allows M3 to outperform standard equal-ratio merging by discovering better contribution ratio combinations. Extensive experiments show that M3 significantly (1) improves merged LLM performance across tasks, (2) enhances out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness, (3) outperforms the positive effects of the sparsification method DARE on model merging and can be further combined with DARE to achieve superior results, and (4) balances exploration efficiency and diversity in contribution ratios by tuning the Beta distribution's shape parameters. The code is provided in the supplementary materials.

  As researchers continue to optimize AI agents for more effective task execution within operating systems, they often overlook a critical security concern: the ability of these agents to detect "impostors" within their environment. Through an analysis of the agents' operational context, we identify a significant threat-attackers can disguise malicious attacks as environmental elements, injecting active disturbances into the agents' execution processes to manipulate their decision-making. We define this novel threat as the Active Environment Injection Attack (AEIA). Focusing on the interaction mechanisms of the Android OS, we conduct a risk assessment of AEIA and identify two critical security vulnerabilities: (1) Adversarial content injection in multimodal interaction interfaces, where attackers embed adversarial instructions within environmental elements to mislead agent decision-making; and (2) Reasoning gap vulnerabilities in the agent's task execution process, which increase susceptibility to AEIA attacks during reasoning. To evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities, we propose AEIA-MN, an attack scheme that exploits interaction vulnerabilities in mobile operating systems to assess the robustness of MLLM-based agents. Experimental results show that even advanced MLLMs are highly vulnerable to this attack, achieving a maximum attack success rate of 93% on the AndroidWorld benchmark by combining two vulnerabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As artificial intelligence surpasses human capabilities in text generation, the necessity to authenticate the origins of AI-generated content has become paramount. Unbiased watermarks offer a powerful solution by embedding statistical signals into language model-generated text without distorting the quality. In this paper, we introduce MCmark, a family of unbiased, Multi-Channel-based watermarks. MCmark works by partitioning the model's vocabulary into segments and promoting token probabilities within a selected segment based on a watermark key. We demonstrate that MCmark not only preserves the original distribution of the language model but also offers significant improvements in detectability and robustness over existing unbiased watermarks. Our experiments with widely-used language models demonstrate an improvement in detectability of over 10% using MCmark, compared to existing state-of-the-art unbiased watermarks. This advancement underscores MCmark's potential in enhancing the practical application of watermarking in AI-generated texts.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Verifying and attributing factual claims is essential for the safe and effective use of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare. A core component of factuality evaluation is fact decomposition, the process of breaking down complex clinical statements into fine-grained atomic facts for verification. Recent work has proposed fact decomposition, which uses LLMs to rewrite source text into concise sentences conveying a single piece of information, to facilitate fine-grained fact verification. However, clinical documentation poses unique challenges for fact decomposition due to dense terminology and diverse note types and remains understudied. To address this gap and explore these challenges, we present FactEHR, an NLI dataset consisting of document fact decompositions for 2,168 clinical notes spanning four types from three hospital systems, resulting in 987,266 entailment pairs. We assess the generated facts on different axes, from entailment evaluation of LLMs to a qualitative analysis. Our evaluation, including review by the clinicians, reveals substantial variability in LLM performance for fact decomposition. For example, Gemini-1.5-Flash consistently generates relevant and accurate facts, while Llama-3 8B produces fewer and less consistent outputs. The results underscore the need for better LLM capabilities to support factual verification in clinical text.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) attempt to imitate human behavior by responding to humans in a way that pleases them, including by adhering to their values. However, humans come from diverse cultures with different values. It is critical to understand whether LLMs showcase different values to the user based on the stereotypical values of a user's known country. We prompt different LLMs with a series of advice requests based on 5 Hofstede Cultural Dimensions -- a quantifiable way of representing the values of a country. Throughout each prompt, we incorporate personas representing 36 different countries and, separately, languages predominantly tied to each country to analyze the consistency in the LLMs' cultural understanding. Through our analysis of the responses, we found that LLMs can differentiate between one side of a value and another, as well as understand that countries have differing values, but will not always uphold the values when giving advice, and fail to understand the need to answer differently based on different cultural values. Rooted in these findings, we present recommendations for training value-aligned and culturally sensitive LLMs. More importantly, the methodology and the framework developed here can help further understand and mitigate culture and language alignment issues with LLMs.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in visual reasoning, yet come with substantial computational cost, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained settings. Despite recent effort on improving the efficiency of MLLMs, prior solutions fall short in responding to varying runtime conditions, in particular changing resource availability (e.g., contention due to the execution of other programs on the device). To bridge this gap, we introduce AdaLLaVA, an adaptive inference framework that learns to dynamically reconfigure operations in an MLLM during inference, accounting for the input data and a latency budget. We conduct extensive experiments across benchmarks involving question-answering, reasoning, and hallucination. Our results show that AdaLLaVA effectively adheres to input latency budget, achieving varying accuracy and latency tradeoffs at runtime. Further, we demonstrate that AdaLLaVA adapts to both input latency and content, can be integrated with token selection for enhanced efficiency, and generalizes across MLLMs. Our project webpage with code release is atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1) state-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements up to 69.2\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR automatically synthesizes (i) an instruction prompt for an inductive reasoning task, (ii) a validation program, executable on model outputs to provide verifiable rewards, and (iii) the latent ground-truth rule. This process is fully automated, scalable, requires no human annotations, and offers precise control over task difficulty. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 19k prompts organized into 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs demonstrate improved performance but incur very high test-time computation, with costs exceeding $300 for just 1,000 prompts. Finally, curriculum learning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. Moreover, these reasoning capabilities generalize to a wide range of established benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of SLR for downstream reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

  The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g., Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic resource to foster further innovation in this field. We present a 9-page version of our work, accepted by ACL 2025, to provide a concise overview to the domain.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning is a critical capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for solving complex multimodal tasks, and judging the correctness of reasoning steps is crucial for improving this capability. Recently, MLLM-based process judges (MPJs) have been widely used to assess the correctness of reasoning steps in multimodal tasks. Therefore, evaluating MPJs is important for identifying their limitations and guiding future improvements. However, existing benchmarks for MPJs mainly focus on tasks such as step correctness classification and reasoning process search, while overlooking a key aspect: whether the confidence scores produced by MPJs at the step level are reliable. To address this gap, we propose ConfProBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of step-level confidence scores generated by MPJs. Our benchmark constructs three types of adversarially perturbed reasoning steps: Synonym Substitution, Syntactic Transformation, and Image Perturbation, to test the robustness of MPJ confidence under perturbations. In addition, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics: Confidence Robustness Score (CRS), Confidence Sensitivity Score (CSS), and Confidence Calibration Score (CCS), which evaluate robustness, sensitivity, and calibration, respectively. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models. Experiments reveal limitations in current MPJs' confidence performance and offer competitive baselines to support future research.

  Fostering students' abilities for knowledge integration and transfer in complex problem-solving scenarios is a core objective of modern education, and interdisciplinary STEM is a key pathway to achieve this, yet it requires expert guidance that is difficult to scale. While LLMs offer potential in this regard, their true capability for guided instruction remains unclear due to the lack of an effective evaluation benchmark. To address this, we introduce SID, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the higher-order guidance capabilities of LLMs in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. Our contributions include a large-scale dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48 complex STEM projects, a novel annotation schema for capturing deep pedagogical features, and a new suite of evaluation metrics (e.g., X-SRG). Baseline experiments confirm that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to execute effective guided dialogues that lead students to achieve knowledge integration and transfer. This highlights the critical value of our benchmark in driving the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs.

  _Rui Ha, Chaozhuo Li, Rui Pu, Sen Su_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated a latent capacity for complex reasoning by spontaneously exhibiting cognitive behaviors such as step-by-step reasoning, reflection, and backtracking, commonly referred to as "Aha Moments". However, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often resulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant reasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions. This leads to excessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical deployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory mechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their reasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To address this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA), which explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and control components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control strategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction mechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and delegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling the construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a structured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised fine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial meta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment Policy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control behavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content. Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained with MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-quality, multi-turn instructional dialogues between novices and experts are essential for developing AI systems that support teaching, learning, and decision-making. These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by which an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and step-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in recording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present SimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding dialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain, SimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching challenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn feedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the creation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real novice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as extroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage. Compared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate comparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the process as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own professional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model using the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional quality. Our analysis highlights GPT-4o's limitations in weak reflective questioning, overuse of generic praise, a condescending tone, and a tendency to overwhelm novices with excessive suggestions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG), a core capability for GUI agents, has primarily relied on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which demands extensive data curation and significant training costs. However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even cover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT post-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient alternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for GUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a reinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical study and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of RFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we decompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of each. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically stabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further explore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT methods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on ScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on ScreenSpotV2.

  While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate impressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their intelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency, while interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically ignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm, we introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate, but to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the full sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence, OmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create scenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine cross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal models reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on high-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges requiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this fragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic performance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive "less is more" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically improve performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI requires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic fusion.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs. Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2 reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.

  BalancedBio is a theoretically grounded framework for parameter-efficient biomedical reasoning, addressing multi-capability integration in domain-specific AI alignment. It establishes the Biomedical Multi-Capability Convergence Theorem, proving orthogonal gradient spaces are essential to prevent capability interference for safe deployment. Key innovations include: (1) Medical Knowledge Grounded Synthetic Generation (MKGSG), extending Source2Synth with clinical workflow constraints and medical ontology validation for factual accuracy and safety; and (2) Capability Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization, deriving optimal hybrid reward weighting to maintain orthogonality in RL, using a reward model with rule-based and model-based scores adapted to biomedical tasks. Mathematical analysis proves Pareto-optimal convergence, preserving performance across capabilities. It achieves state-of-the-art results in its parameter class: domain expertise (80.95% BIOMED-MMLU, +15.32% over baseline), reasoning (61.94%, +7.75%), instruction following (67.95%, +6.44%), and integration (86.7%, +18.5%). Theoretical safety guarantees include bounds on capability preservation and clinical accuracy. Real-world deployment yields 78% cost reduction, 23% improved diagnostic accuracy, and 89% clinician acceptance.

  Automated grading systems can efficiently score short-answer responses, yet they often fail to indicate when a grading decision is uncertain or potentially contentious. We introduce semantic entropy, a measure of variability across multiple GPT-4-generated explanations for the same student response, as a proxy for human grader disagreement. By clustering rationales via entailment-based similarity and computing entropy over these clusters, we quantify the diversity of justifications without relying on final output scores. We address three research questions: (1) Does semantic entropy align with human grader disagreement? (2) Does it generalize across academic subjects? (3) Is it sensitive to structural task features such as source dependency? Experiments on the ASAP-SAS dataset show that semantic entropy correlates with rater disagreement, varies meaningfully across subjects, and increases in tasks requiring interpretive reasoning. Our findings position semantic entropy as an interpretable uncertainty signal that supports more transparent and trustworthy AI-assisted grading workflows.

  In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural language processing tasks but face significant challenges in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. To address these limitations, we propose KG-Augmented Executable Chain-of-Thought (KGA-ECoT), a novel framework that enhances code generation through knowledge graphs and improves mathematical reasoning via executable code. KGA-ECoT decomposes problems into a Structured Task Graph, leverages efficient GraphRAG for precise knowledge retrieval from mathematical libraries, and generates verifiable code to ensure computational accuracy. Evaluations on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KGA-ECoT significantly outperforms existing prompting methods, achieving absolute accuracy improvements ranging from several to over ten percentage points. Further analysis confirms the critical roles of GraphRAG in enhancing code quality and external code execution in ensuring precision. These findings collectively establish KGA-ECoT as a robust and highly generalizable framework for complex mathematical reasoning tasks.

  Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Siri and Google Assistant are designed to enhance human capabilities and perform tasks on behalf of users. The emergence of LLM agents brings new opportunities for the development of IPAs. While responsive capabilities have been widely studied, proactive behaviors remain underexplored. Designing an IPA that is proactive, privacy-preserving, and capable of self-evolution remains a significant challenge. Designing such IPAs relies on the cognitive architecture of LLM agents. This work proposes Cognition Forest, a semantic structure designed to align cognitive modeling with system-level design. We unify cognitive architecture and system design into a self-reinforcing loop instead of treating them separately. Based on this principle, we present Galaxy, a framework that supports multidimensional interactions and personalized capability generation. Two cooperative agents are implemented based on Galaxy: KoRa, a cognition-enhanced generative agent that supports both responsive and proactive skills; and Kernel, a meta-cognition-based meta-agent that enables Galaxy's self-evolution and privacy preservation. Experimental results show that Galaxy outperforms multiple state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies and real-world interaction cases validate the effectiveness of Galaxy.

  Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators. Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models, highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.

  Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully automated solver design.

  Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on multimodal large language models exhibit strong collaboration and performance. However, their growing openness and interaction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial attacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as dedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this paradigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection, and (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised, system-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents further raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to simultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats, ensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure. Furthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial training paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS performance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces attack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on reasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.

  Collaborative partnership matters in inquiry-oriented education. However, most study partners are selected either rely on experience-based assignments with little scientific planning or build on rule-based machine assistants, encountering difficulties in knowledge expansion and inadequate flexibility. This paper proposes an LLM-empowered agent model for simulating and selecting learning partners tailored to inquiry-oriented learning, named InqEduAgent. Generative agents are designed to capture cognitive and evaluative features of learners in real-world scenarios. Then, an adaptive matching algorithm with Gaussian process augmentation is formulated to identify patterns within prior knowledge. Optimal learning-partner matches are provided for learners facing different exercises. The experimental results show the optimal performance of InqEduAgent in most knowledge-learning scenarios and LLM environment with different levels of capabilities. This study promotes the intelligent allocation of human-based learning partners and the formulation of AI-based learning partners. The code, data, and appendix are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available atthis https URL.

  This study investigates the self-rationalization framework constructed with a cooperative game, where a generator initially extracts the most informative segment from raw input, and a subsequent predictor utilizes the selected subset for its input. The generator and predictor are trained collaboratively to maximize prediction accuracy. In this paper, we first uncover a potential caveat: such a cooperative game could unintentionally introduce a sampling bias during rationale extraction. Specifically, the generator might inadvertently create an incorrect correlation between the selected rationale candidate and the label, even when they are semantically unrelated in the original dataset. Subsequently, we elucidate the origins of this bias using both detailed theoretical analysis and empirical evidence. Our findings suggest a direction for inspecting these correlations through attacks, based on which we further introduce an instruction to prevent the predictor from learning the correlations. Through experiments on six text classification datasets and two graph classification datasets using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT, and GCN), we show that our method not only significantly outperforms recent rationalization methods, but also achieves comparable or even better results than a representative LLM (llama3.1-8b-instruct).

  Since the release of GPT2-1.5B in 2019, the large language models (LLMs) have evolved from specialized deep models to versatile foundation models. While demonstrating remarkable zero-shot ability, the LLMs still require fine-tuning on local datasets and substantial memory for deployment over the network edges. Traditional first-order fine-tuning techniques require significant GPU memory that exceeds the capacity of mainstream hardware. Besides, the LLMs have been expanded beyond text generation to create images, audio, video, and multi-modal content, necessitating careful investigation of efficient deployment strategies for large-scale foundation models. In response to these challenges, model fine-tuning and model-compression techniques have been developed to support the sustainable growth of LLMs by reducing both operational and capital expenditures. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of prevalent memory-efficient fine-tuning methods for deployment at the network edge. We also review state-of-the-art literature on model compression, offering insights into the deployment of LLMs at network edges.
