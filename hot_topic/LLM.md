- **[ASHiTA: Automatic Scene-grounded HIerarchical Task Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06553)**  `arXiv:2504.06553`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  While recent work in scene reconstruction and understanding has made strides in grounding natural language to physical 3D environments, it is still challenging to ground abstract, high-level instructions to a 3D scene. High-level instructions might not explicitly invoke semantic elements in the scene, and even the process of breaking a high-level task into a set of more concrete subtasks, a process called hierarchical task analysis, is environment-dependent. In this work, we propose ASHiTA, the first framework that generates a task hierarchy grounded to a 3D scene graph by breaking down high-level tasks into grounded subtasks. ASHiTA alternates LLM-assisted hierarchical task analysis, to generate the task breakdown, with task-driven 3D scene graph construction to generate a suitable representation of the environment. Our experiments show that ASHiTA performs significantly better than LLM baselines in breaking down high-level tasks into environment-dependent subtasks and is additionally able to achieve grounding performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Path planning is a fundamental scientific problem in robotics and autonomous navigation, requiring the derivation of efficient routes from starting to destination points while avoiding obstacles. Traditional algorithms like A* and its variants are capable of ensuring path validity but suffer from significant computational and memory inefficiencies as the state space grows. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) excel in broader environmental analysis through contextual understanding, providing global insights into environments. However, they fall short in detailed spatial and temporal reasoning, often leading to invalid or inefficient routes. In this work, we propose LLM-A*, an new LLM based route planning method that synergistically combines the precise pathfinding capabilities of A* with the global reasoning capability of LLMs. This hybrid approach aims to enhance pathfinding efficiency in terms of time and space complexity while maintaining the integrity of path validity, especially in large-scale scenarios. By integrating the strengths of both methodologies, LLM-A* addresses the computational and memory limitations of conventional algorithms without compromising on the validity required for effective pathfinding.

- **[Domain-Conditioned Scene Graphs for State-Grounded Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06661)**  `arXiv:2504.06661`  `cs.RO`  
  _Jonas Herzog, Jiangpin Liu, Yue Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent robotic task planning frameworks have integrated large multimodal models (LMMs) such as GPT-4V. To address grounding issues of such models, it has been suggested to split the pipeline into perceptional state grounding and subsequent state-based planning. As we show in this work, the state grounding ability of LMM-based approaches is still limited by weaknesses in granular, structured, domain-specific scene understanding. To address this shortcoming, we develop a more structured state grounding framework that features a domain-conditioned scene graph as its scene representation. We show that such representation is actionable in nature as it is directly mappable to a symbolic state in classical planning languages such as PDDL. We provide an instantiation of our state grounding framework where the domain-conditioned scene graph generation is implemented with a lightweight vision-language approach that classifies domain-specific predicates on top of domain-relevant object detections. Evaluated across three domains, our approach achieves significantly higher state estimation accuracy and task planning success rates compared to the previous LMM-based approaches.

- **[Hogwild! Inference: Parallel LLM Generation via Concurrent Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06261)**  `arXiv:2504.06261`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content generation, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long inference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to expedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks, exploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown that LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation frameworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks may not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their applicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM "workers" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated attention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our approach allows the instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy for the problem at hand, all the while "seeing" each other's partial progress in the concurrent cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in parallel with the same attention cache, with "instant" access to each other's generated tokens. Hogwild! inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization. We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning.

- **[A Survey on Mixture of Experts in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06204)**  `arXiv:2407.06204`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have garnered unprecedented advancements across diverse fields, ranging from natural language processing to computer vision and beyond. The prowess of LLMs is underpinned by their substantial model size, extensive and diverse datasets, and the vast computational power harnessed during training, all of which contribute to the emergent abilities of LLMs (e.g., in-context learning) that are not present in small models. Within this context, the mixture of experts (MoE) has emerged as an effective method for substantially scaling up model capacity with minimal computation overhead, gaining significant attention from academia and industry. Despite its growing prevalence, there lacks a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature on MoE. This survey seeks to bridge that gap, serving as an essential resource for researchers delving into the intricacies of MoE. We first briefly introduce the structure of the MoE layer, followed by proposing a new taxonomy of MoE. Next, we overview the core designs for various MoE models including both algorithmic and systemic aspects, alongside collections of available open-source implementations, hyperparameter configurations and empirical evaluations. Furthermore, we delineate the multifaceted applications of MoE in practice, and outline some potential directions for future research. To facilitate ongoing updates and the sharing of cutting-edge advances in MoE research, we have established a resource repository atthis https URL.

  Parameter generation has emerged as a novel paradigm for neural network development, offering an alternative to traditional neural network training by synthesizing high-quality model weights directly. In the context of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for evolving ($\textit{i.e.}$, constantly updated) large language models (LLMs), this approach promises efficient adaptation without costly retraining. However, existing methods face critical limitations in simultaneously achieving scalability and controllability. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{ORAL}$, a novel $\textbf{conditional recurrent diffusion}$ framework that addresses these challenges. $\texttt{ORAL}$ incorporates a novel conditioning mechanism that integrates model architecture and textual task specifications, enabling the generation of task-specific LoRA parameters that can seamlessly transfer across evolving foundation models. Our approach successfully scales to billions-of-parameter LLMs and maintains controllability. Through extensive experiments across seven language tasks, four vision tasks, and three multimodal tasks using five pre-trained LLMs, we demonstrate that $\texttt{ORAL}$ generates high-quality LoRA parameters that achieve comparable or superior performance to vanilla trained counterparts.

- **[Bridging the Gap Between Preference Alignment and Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06659)**  `arXiv:2504.06659`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Xiaohua Feng, Yuyuan Li, Huwei Ji, Jiaming Zhang, Li Zhang, Tianyu Du, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite advances in Preference Alignment (PA) for Large Language Models (LLMs), mainstream methods like Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) face notable challenges. These approaches require high-quality datasets of positive preference examples, which are costly to obtain and computationally intensive due to training instability, limiting their use in low-resource scenarios. LLM unlearning technique presents a promising alternative, by directly removing the influence of negative examples. However, current research has primarily focused on empirical validation, lacking systematic quantitative analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework to explore the relationship between PA and LLM unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a bi-level optimization-based method to quantify the impact of unlearning specific negative examples on PA performance. Our analysis reveals that not all negative examples contribute equally to alignment improvement when unlearned, and the effect varies significantly across examples. Building on this insight, we pose a crucial question: how can we optimally select and weight negative examples for unlearning to maximize PA performance? To answer this, we propose a framework called Unlearning to Align (U2A), which leverages bi-level optimization to efficiently select and unlearn examples for optimal PA performance. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, with results confirming its effectiveness.

- **[A Neuro-inspired Interpretation of Unlearning in Large Language Models through Sample-level Unlearning Difficulty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06658)**  `arXiv:2504.06658`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Xiaohua Feng, Yuyuan Li, Chengye Wang, Junlin Liu, Li Zhang, Chaochao Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Driven by privacy protection laws and regulations, unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is gaining increasing attention. However, current research often neglects the interpretability of the unlearning process, particularly concerning sample-level unlearning difficulty. Existing studies typically assume a uniform unlearning difficulty across samples. This simplification risks attributing the performance of unlearning algorithms to sample selection rather than the algorithm's design, potentially steering the development of LLM unlearning in the wrong direction. Thus, we investigate the relationship between LLM unlearning and sample characteristics, with a focus on unlearning difficulty. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience, we propose a Memory Removal Difficulty ($\mathrm{MRD}$) metric to quantify sample-level unlearning difficulty. Using $\mathrm{MRD}$, we analyze the characteristics of hard-to-unlearn versus easy-to-unlearn samples. Furthermore, we propose an $\mathrm{MRD}$-based weighted sampling method to optimize existing unlearning algorithms, which prioritizes easily forgettable samples, thereby improving unlearning efficiency and effectiveness. We validate the proposed metric and method using public benchmarks and datasets, with results confirming its effectiveness.

- **[GWQ: Gradient-Aware Weight Quantization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00850)**  `arXiv:2411.00850`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Yihua Shao, Yan Gu, Siyu Chen, Haiyang Liu, Zijian Ling, Minxi Yan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) show impressive performance in solving complex language tasks. However, its large number of parameters presents significant challenges for the deployment. So, compressing LLMs to low bits can enable to deploy on resource-constrained devices. To address this problem, we propose gradient-aware weight quantization (GWQ), the first quantization approach for low-bit weight quantization that leverages gradients to localize outliers, requiring only a minimal amount of calibration data for outlier detection. GWQ retains the top 1\% outliers preferentially at FP16 precision, while the remaining non-outlier weights are stored in a low-bit. We widely evaluate GWQ on different task include language modeling, grounding detection, massive multitask language understanding and vision-language question and answering. Results show that models quantified by GWQ performs better than other quantization method. During quantization process, GWQ only need one calibration set to realize effective quant. Also, GWQ achieves 1.2x inference speedup in comparison to the original model and effectively reduces the inference memory.

- **[Can you Finetune your Binoculars? Embedding Text Watermarks into the Weights of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06446)**  `arXiv:2504.06446`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Fay Elhassan, Niccol√≤ Ajroldi, Antonio Orvieto, Jonas Geiping_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The indistinguishability of AI-generated content from human text raises challenges in transparency and accountability. While several methods exist to watermark models behind APIs, embedding watermark strategies directly into model weights that are later reflected in the outputs of the model is challenging. In this study we propose a strategy to finetune a pair of low-rank adapters of a model, one serving as the text-generating model, and the other as the detector, so that a subtle watermark is embedded into the text generated by the first model and simultaneously optimized for detectability by the second. In this way, the watermarking strategy is fully learned end-to-end. This process imposes an optimization challenge, as balancing watermark robustness, naturalness, and task performance requires trade-offs. We discuss strategies on how to optimize this min-max objective and present results showing the effect of this modification to instruction finetuning.

- **[Mosaic: Composite Projection Pruning for Resource-efficient LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06323)**  `arXiv:2504.06323`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Bailey J. Eccles, Leon Wong, Blesson Varghese_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Extensive compute and memory requirements limit the deployment of large language models (LLMs) on any hardware. Compression methods, such as pruning, can reduce model size, which in turn reduces resource requirements. State-of-the-art pruning is based on coarse-grained methods. They are time-consuming and inherently remove critical model parameters, adversely impacting the quality of the pruned model. This paper introduces projection pruning, a novel fine-grained method for pruning LLMs. In addition, LLM projection pruning is enhanced by a new approach we refer to as composite projection pruning - the synergistic combination of unstructured pruning that retains accuracy and structured pruning that reduces model size. We develop Mosaic, a novel system to create and deploy pruned LLMs using composite projection pruning. Mosaic is evaluated using a range of performance and quality metrics on multiple hardware platforms, LLMs, and datasets. Mosaic is 7.19x faster in producing models than existing approaches. Mosaic models achieve up to 84.2% lower perplexity and 31.4% higher accuracy than models obtained from coarse-grained pruning. Up to 67% faster inference and 68% lower GPU memory use is noted for Mosaic models.

- **[Accelerating LLM Inference Throughput via Asynchronous KV Cache Prefetching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06319)**  `arXiv:2504.06319`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yanhao Dong, Yubo Miao, Weinan Li, Xiao Zheng, Chao Wang, Feng Lyu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit pronounced memory-bound characteristics during inference due to High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) bandwidth constraints. In this paper, we propose an L2 Cache-oriented asynchronous KV Cache prefetching method to break through the memory bandwidth bottleneck in LLM inference through computation-load overlap. By strategically scheduling idle memory bandwidth during active computation windows, our method proactively prefetches required KV Cache into GPU L2 cache, enabling high-speed L2 cache hits for subsequent accesses and effectively hiding HBM access latency within computational cycles. Extensive experiments on NVIDIA H20 GPUs demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 2.15x improvement in attention kernel efficiency and up to 1.97x end-to-end throughput enhancement, surpassing state-of-the-art baseline FlashAttention-3. Notably, our solution maintains orthogonality to existing optimization techniques and can be integrated with current inference frameworks, providing a scalable latency-hiding solution for next-generation LLM inference engines.

  _Tahniat Khan, Soroor Motie, Sedef Akinli Kocak, Shaina Raza_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant energy consumption and carbon emissions, posing a critical challenge to the sustainability of generative AI technologies. This paper explores the integration of energy-efficient optimization techniques in the deployment of LLMs to address these environmental concerns. We present a case study and framework that demonstrate how strategic quantization and local inference techniques can substantially lower the carbon footprints of LLMs without compromising their operational effectiveness. Experimental results reveal that these methods can reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by up to 45\% post quantization, making them particularly suitable for resource-constrained environments. The findings provide actionable insights for achieving sustainability in AI while maintaining high levels of accuracy and responsiveness.

- **[PiSSA: Principal Singular Values and Singular Vectors Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02948)**  `arXiv:2404.02948`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Fanxu Meng, Zhaohui Wang, Muhan Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To parameter-efficiently fine-tune (PEFT) large language models (LLMs), the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method approximates the model changes $\Delta W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ through the product of two matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$, where $r \ll \min(m, n)$, $A$ is initialized with Gaussian noise, and $B$ with zeros. LoRA freezes the original model $W$ and updates the "Noise & Zero" adapter, which may lead to slow convergence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Principal Singular values and Singular vectors Adaptation (PiSSA). PiSSA shares the same architecture as LoRA, but initializes the adaptor matrices $A$ and $B$ with the principal components of the original matrix $W$, and put the remaining components into a residual matrix $W^{res} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ which is frozen during fine-tuning. Compared to LoRA, PiSSA updates the principal components while freezing the "residual" parts, allowing faster convergence and enhanced performance. Comparative experiments of PiSSA and LoRA across 12 different models, ranging from 184M to 70B, encompassing 5 NLG and 8 NLU tasks, reveal that PiSSA consistently outperforms LoRA under identical experimental setups. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with PiSSA achieves an accuracy of 72.86%, surpassing LoRA's 67.7% by 5.16%. Due to the same architecture, PiSSA is also compatible with quantization to further reduce the memory requirement of fine-tuning. Compared to QLoRA, QPiSSA exhibits smaller quantization errors in the initial stages. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3-70B on GSM8K, QPiSSA attains an accuracy of 86.05%, exceeding the performances of QLoRA at 81.73%. Leveraging a fast SVD technique, PiSSA can be initialized in only a few seconds, presenting a negligible cost for transitioning from LoRA to PiSSA. Code is available atthis https URL.

- **[To Backtrack or Not to Backtrack: When Sequential Search Limits Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07052)**  `arXiv:2504.07052`  `cs.LG`  
  _Tian Qin, David Alvarez-Melis, Samy Jelassi, Eran Malach_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models have significantly improved their reasoning abilities, particularly through techniques involving search and backtracking. Backtracking naturally scales test-time compute by enabling sequential, linearized exploration via long chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, this is not the only strategy for scaling test-time compute: parallel sampling with best-of-n selection provides an alternative that generates diverse solutions simultaneously. Despite the growing adoption of sequential search, its advantages over parallel sampling--especially under a fixed compute budget remain poorly understood. In this paper, we systematically compare these two approaches on two challenging reasoning tasks: CountDown and Sudoku. Surprisingly, we find that sequential search underperforms parallel sampling on CountDown but outperforms it on Sudoku, suggesting that backtracking is not universally beneficial. We identify two factors that can cause backtracking to degrade performance: (1) training on fixed search traces can lock models into suboptimal strategies, and (2) explicit CoT supervision can discourage "implicit" (non-verbalized) reasoning. Extending our analysis to reinforcement learning (RL), we show that models with backtracking capabilities benefit significantly from RL fine-tuning, while models without backtracking see limited, mixed gains. Together, these findings challenge the assumption that backtracking universally enhances LLM reasoning, instead revealing a complex interaction between task structure, training data, model scale, and learning paradigm.

- **[GTS-LUM: Reshaping User Behavior Modeling with LLMs in Telecommunications Industry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06511)**  `arXiv:2504.06511`  `cs.LG`  
  _Liu Shi, Tianwu Zhou, Wei Xu, Li Liu, Zhexin Cui, Shaoyi Liang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As telecommunication service providers shifting their focus to analyzing user behavior for package design and marketing interventions, a critical challenge lies in developing a unified, end-to-end framework capable of modeling long-term and periodic user behavior sequences with diverse time granularities, multi-modal data inputs, and heterogeneous labels. This paper introduces GTS-LUM, a novel user behavior model that redefines modeling paradigms in telecommunication settings. GTS-LUM adopts a (multi-modal) encoder-adapter-LLM decoder architecture, enhanced with several telecom-specific innovations. Specifically, the model incorporates an advanced timestamp processing method to handle varying time granularities. It also supports multi-modal data inputs -- including structured tables and behavior co-occurrence graphs -- and aligns these with semantic information extracted by a tokenizer using a Q-former structure. Additionally, GTS-LUM integrates a front-placed target-aware mechanism to highlight historical behaviors most relevant to the target. Extensive experiments on industrial dataset validate the effectiveness of this end-to-end framework and also demonstrate that GTS-LUM outperforms LLM4Rec approaches which are popular in recommendation systems, offering an effective and generalizing solution for user behavior modeling in telecommunications.

- **[SPIRe: Boosting LLM Inference Throughput with Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06419)**  `arXiv:2504.06419`  `cs.LG`  
  _Sanjit Neelam, Daniel Heinlein, Vaclav Cvicek, Akshay Mishra, Reiner Pope_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative decoding (SD) has been shown to reduce the latency of autoregressive decoding (AD) by 2-3x for small batch sizes. However, increasing throughput and therefore reducing the cost per token requires decoding with large batch sizes. Recent work shows that SD can accelerate decoding with large batch sizes too if the context is sufficiently long and the draft model's KV cache is sparse. We introduce SPIRe, a draft model that combines static sparse attention, pruned initialization, and feedback memory to increase the modeled throughput of speculative decoding by over 100% compared to speculation with a much smaller draft model and by over 35% compared to the strong baseline of sparse self-speculation. Our approach is particularly effective when context lengths vary significantly across requests.

- **[Unifying Autoregressive and Diffusion-Based Sequence Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06416)**  `arXiv:2504.06416`  `cs.LG`  
  _Nima Fathi, Torsten Scholak, Pierre-Andr√© No√´l_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present significant extensions to diffusion-based sequence generation models, blurring the line with autoregressive language models. We introduce hyperschedules, which assign distinct noise schedules to individual token positions, generalizing both autoregressive models (e.g., GPT) and conventional diffusion models (e.g., SEDD, MDLM) as special cases. Second, we propose two hybrid token-wise noising processes that interpolate between absorbing and uniform processes, enabling the model to fix past mistakes, and we introduce a novel inference algorithm that leverages this new feature in a simplified context inspired from MDLM. To support efficient training and inference, we design attention masks compatible with KV-caching. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art perplexity and generate diverse, high-quality sequences across standard benchmarks, suggesting a promising path for autoregressive diffusion-based sequence generation.

- **[AdvBDGen: Adversarially Fortified Prompt-Specific Fuzzy Backdoor Generator Against LLM Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11283)**  `arXiv:2410.11283`  `cs.LG`  
  _Pankayaraj Pathmanathan, Udari Madhushani Sehwag, Michael-Andrei Panaitescu-Liess, Furong Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the growing adoption of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs), the risk of backdoor installation during alignment has increased, leading to unintended and harmful behaviors. Existing backdoor triggers are typically limited to fixed word patterns, making them detectable during data cleaning and easily removable post-poisoning. In this work, we explore the use of prompt-specific paraphrases as backdoor triggers, enhancing their stealth and resistance to removal during LLM alignment. We propose AdvBDGen, an adversarially fortified generative fine-tuning framework that automatically generates prompt-specific backdoors that are effective, stealthy, and transferable across models. AdvBDGen employs a generator-discriminator pair, fortified by an adversary, to ensure the installability and stealthiness of backdoors. It enables the crafting and successful installation of complex triggers using as little as 3% of the fine-tuning data. Once installed, these backdoors can jailbreak LLMs during inference, demonstrate improved stability against perturbations compared to traditional constant triggers, and are more challenging to remove. These findings underscore an urgent need for the research community to develop more robust defenses against adversarial backdoor threats in LLM alignment.

- **[OmniCaptioner: One Captioner to Rule Them All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07089)**  `arXiv:2504.07089`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Yiting Lu, Jiakang Yuan, Zhen Li, Shitian Zhao, Qi Qin, Xinyue Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose OmniCaptioner, a versatile visual captioning framework for generating fine-grained textual descriptions across a wide variety of visual domains. Unlike prior methods limited to specific image types (e.g., natural images or geometric visuals), our framework provides a unified solution for captioning natural images, visual text (e.g., posters, UIs, textbooks), and structured visuals (e.g., documents, tables, charts). By converting low-level pixel information into semantically rich textual representations, our framework bridges the gap between visual and textual modalities. Our results highlight three key advantages: (i) Enhanced Visual Reasoning with LLMs, where long-context captions of visual modalities empower LLMs, particularly the DeepSeek-R1 series, to reason effectively in multimodal scenarios; (ii) Improved Image Generation, where detailed captions improve tasks like text-to-image generation and image transformation; and (iii) Efficient Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which enables faster convergence with less data. We believe the versatility and adaptability of OmniCaptioner can offer a new perspective for bridging the gap between language and visual modalities.

- **[A Unified Agentic Framework for Evaluating Conditional Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07046)**  `arXiv:2504.07046`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Jifang Wang, Xue Yang, Longyue Wang, Zhenran Xu, Yiyu Wang, Yaowei Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conditional image generation has gained significant attention for its ability to personalize content. However, the field faces challenges in developing task-agnostic, reliable, and explainable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces CIGEval, a unified agentic framework for comprehensive evaluation of conditional image generation tasks. CIGEval utilizes large multimodal models (LMMs) as its core, integrating a multi-functional toolbox and establishing a fine-grained evaluation framework. Additionally, we synthesize evaluation trajectories for fine-tuning, empowering smaller LMMs to autonomously select appropriate tools and conduct nuanced analyses based on tool outputs. Experiments across seven prominent conditional image generation tasks demonstrate that CIGEval (GPT-4o version) achieves a high correlation of 0.4625 with human assessments, closely matching the inter-annotator correlation of 0.47. Moreover, when implemented with 7B open-source LMMs using only 2.3K training trajectories, CIGEval surpasses the previous GPT-4o-based state-of-the-art method. Case studies on GPT-4o image generation highlight CIGEval's capability in identifying subtle issues related to subject consistency and adherence to control guidance, indicating its great potential for automating evaluation of image generation tasks with human-level reliability.

- **[Unsolvable Problem Detection: Robust Understanding Evaluation for Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20331)**  `arXiv:2403.20331`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Atsuyuki Miyai, Jingkang Yang, Jingyang Zhang, Yifei Ming, Qing Yu, Go Irie, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces a novel task to evaluate the robust understanding capability of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), termed $\textbf{Unsolvable Problem Detection (UPD)}$. Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is widely used to assess the understanding capability of LMMs, but it does not guarantee that LMMs truly comprehend the answer. UPD assesses the LMM's ability to withhold answers when encountering unsolvable problems of MCQA, verifying whether the model truly understands the answer. UPD encompasses three problems: Absent Answer Detection (AAD), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (IASD), and Incompatible Visual Question Detection (IVQD), covering unsolvable cases like answer-lacking or incompatible choices and image-question mismatches. For the evaluation, we introduce the MM-UPD Bench, a benchmark for assessing performance across various ability dimensions. Our experiments reveal that even most LMMs, which demonstrate adequate performance on existing benchmarks, struggle significantly with MM-UPD, underscoring a novel aspect of trustworthiness that current benchmarks have overlooked. A detailed analysis shows that LMMs have different bottlenecks and chain-of-thought and self-reflection improved performance for LMMs with the bottleneck in their LLM capability. We hope our insights will enhance the broader understanding and development of more reliable LMMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automatic dietary assessment based on food images remains a challenge, requiring precise food detection, segmentation, and classification. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer new possibilities by integrating visual and textual reasoning. In this study, we evaluate six state-of-the-art VLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Moondream, DeepSeek, and LLaVA), analyzing their capabilities in food recognition at different levels. For the experimental framework, we introduce the FoodNExTDB, a unique food image database that contains 9,263 expert-labeled images across 10 categories (e.g., "protein source"), 62 subcategories (e.g., "poultry"), and 9 cooking styles (e.g., "grilled"). In total, FoodNExTDB includes 50k nutritional labels generated by seven experts who manually annotated all images in the database. Also, we propose a novel evaluation metric, Expert-Weighted Recall (EWR), that accounts for the inter-annotator variability. Results show that closed-source models outperform open-source ones, achieving over 90% EWR in recognizing food products in images containing a single product. Despite their potential, current VLMs face challenges in fine-grained food recognition, particularly in distinguishing subtle differences in cooking styles and visually similar food items, which limits their reliability for automatic dietary assessment. The FoodNExTDB database is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-shot, training-free, image-based text-to-video generation is an emerging area that aims to generate videos using existing image-based diffusion models. Current methods in this space require specific architectural changes to image generation models, which limit their adaptability and scalability. In contrast to such methods, we provide a model-agnostic approach. We use intersections in diffusion trajectories, working only with the latent values. We could not obtain localized frame-wise coherence and diversity using only the intersection of trajectories. Thus, we instead use a grid-based approach. An in-context trained LLM is used to generate coherent frame-wise prompts; another is used to identify differences between frames. Based on these, we obtain a CLIP-based attention mask that controls the timing of switching the prompts for each grid cell. Earlier switching results in higher variance, while later switching results in more coherence. Therefore, our approach can ensure appropriate control between coherence and variance for the frames. Our approach results in state-of-the-art performance while being more flexible when working with diverse image-generation models. The empirical analysis using quantitative metrics and user studies confirms our model's superior temporal consistency, visual fidelity and user satisfaction, thus providing a novel way to obtain training-free, image-based text-to-video generation.

  Effective and rapid evaluation of pavement surface condition is critical for prioritizing maintenance, ensuring transportation safety, and minimizing vehicle wear and tear. While conventional manual inspections suffer from subjectivity, existing machine learning-based methods are constrained by their reliance on large and high-quality labeled datasets, which require significant resources and limit adaptability across varied road conditions. The revolutionary advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant potential for overcoming these challenges. In this study, we propose an innovative automated zero-shot learning approach that leverages the image recognition and natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs to assess road conditions effectively. Multiple LLM-based assessment models were developed, employing prompt engineering strategies aligned with the Pavement Surface Condition Index (PSCI) standards. These models' accuracy and reliability were evaluated against official PSCI results, with an optimized model ultimately selected. Extensive tests benchmarked the optimized model against evaluations from various levels experts using Google Street View road images. The results reveal that the LLM-based approach can effectively assess road conditions, with the optimized model -employing comprehensive and structured prompt engineering strategies -outperforming simpler configurations by achieving high accuracy and consistency, even surpassing expert evaluations. Moreover, successfully applying the optimized model to Google Street View images demonstrates its potential for future city-scale deployments. These findings highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in automating road damage evaluations and underscore the pivotal role of detailed prompt engineering in achieving reliable assessments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modality image fusion aims to synthesize a single, comprehensive image from multiple source inputs. Traditional approaches, such as CNNs and GANs, offer efficiency but struggle to handle low-quality or complex inputs. Recent advances in text-guided methods leverage large model priors to overcome these limitations, but at the cost of significant computational overhead, both in memory and inference time. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for distilling large model priors, eliminating the need for text guidance during inference while dramatically reducing model size. Our framework utilizes a teacher-student architecture, where the teacher network incorporates large model priors and transfers this knowledge to a smaller student network via a tailored distillation process. Additionally, we introduce spatial-channel cross-fusion module to enhance the model's ability to leverage textual priors across both spatial and channel dimensions. Our method achieves a favorable trade-off between computational efficiency and fusion quality. The distilled network, requiring only 10\% of the parameters and inference time of the teacher network, retains 90\% of its performance and outperforms existing SOTA methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The implementation will be made publicly available as an open-source resource.

  Recent advancements in reinforcement learning have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Moving object segmentation plays a vital role in understanding dynamic visual environments. While existing methods rely on multi-frame image sequences to identify moving objects, single-image MOS is critical for applications like motion intention prediction and handling camera frame drops. However, segmenting moving objects from a single image remains challenging for existing methods due to the absence of temporal cues. To address this gap, we propose MovSAM, the first framework for single-image moving object segmentation. MovSAM leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) enhanced with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to search the moving object and generate text prompts based on deep thinking for segmentation. These prompts are cross-fused with visual features from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and a Vision-Language Model (VLM), enabling logic-driven moving object segmentation. The segmentation results then undergo a deep thinking refinement loop, allowing MovSAM to iteratively improve its understanding of the scene context and inter-object relationships with logical reasoning. This innovative approach enables MovSAM to segment moving objects in single images by considering scene understanding. We implement MovSAM in the real world to validate its practical application and effectiveness for autonomous driving scenarios where the multi-frame methods fail. Furthermore, despite the inherent advantage of multi-frame methods in utilizing temporal information, MovSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across public MOS benchmarks, reaching 92.5\% on J\&F. Our implementation will be available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long video understanding is a complex task that requires both spatial detail and temporal awareness. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) obtain frame-level understanding capabilities through multi-frame input, they suffer from information loss due to the sparse sampling strategy. In contrast, Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) capture temporal relationships within visual features but are limited by the scarcity of high-quality video-text datasets. To transfer long video understanding capabilities to VLMs with minimal data and computational cost, we propose Lightweight Video Compression (LVC), a novel method featuring the Query-Attention Video Compression mechanism, which effectively tackles the sparse sampling problem in VLMs. By training only the alignment layer with 10k short video-text pairs, LVC significantly enhances the temporal reasoning abilities of VLMs. Extensive experiments show that LVC provides consistent performance improvements across various models, including the InternVL2 series and Phi-3.5-Vision. Notably, the InternVL2-40B-LVC achieves scores of 68.2 and 65.9 on the long video understanding benchmarks MLVU and Video-MME, respectively, with relative improvements of 14.6% and 7.7%. The enhanced models and code will be publicly available soon.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-quality image captions play a crucial role in improving the performance of cross-modal applications such as text-to-image generation, text-to-video generation, and text-image retrieval. To generate long-form, high-quality captions, many recent studies have employed multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, current MLLMs often produce captions that lack fine-grained details or suffer from hallucinations, a challenge that persists in both open-source and closed-source models. Inspired by Feature-Integration theory, which suggests that attention must focus on specific regions to integrate visual information effectively, we propose a \textbf{divide-then-aggregate} strategy. Our method first divides the image into semantic and spatial patches to extract fine-grained details, enhancing the model's local perception of the image. These local details are then hierarchically aggregated to generate a comprehensive global description. To address hallucinations and inconsistencies in the generated captions, we apply a semantic-level filtering process during hierarchical aggregation. This training-free pipeline can be applied to both open-source models (LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-1.6, Mini-Gemini) and closed-source models (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o, GLM-4V-Plus). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates more detailed, reliable captions, advancing multimodal description generation without requiring model retraining.

  Recent advancements in reward signal usage for Large Language Models (LLMs) are remarkable. However, significant challenges exist when transitioning reward signal to the multimodal domain, including labor-intensive annotations, over-reliance on one-step rewards, and inadequate evaluation. To address these issues, we propose SVIP, a novel approach to train a step-level multi-dimensional Chain-of-Thought~(CoT) reward model automatically. It generates code for solving visual tasks and transforms the analysis of code blocks into the evaluation of CoT step as training samples. Then, we train SVIP-Reward model using a multi-head attention mechanism called TriAtt-CoT. The advantages of SVIP-Reward are evident throughout the entire process of MLLM. We also introduce a benchmark for CoT reward model training and testing. Experimental results demonstrate that SVIP-Reward improves MLLM performance across training and inference-time scaling, yielding better results on benchmarks while reducing hallucinations and enhancing reasoning ability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The practical application of AI tools for specific computer vision tasks relies on the "small-data regime" of hundreds to thousands of labeled samples. This small-data regime is vital for applications requiring expensive expert annotations, such as ecological monitoring, medical diagnostics or industrial quality control. We find, however, that computer vision research has ignored the small data regime as evaluations increasingly focus on zero- and few-shot learning. We use the Natural World Tasks (NeWT) benchmark to compare multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and vision-only methods across varying training set sizes. MLLMs exhibit early performance plateaus, while vision-only methods improve throughout the small-data regime, with performance gaps widening beyond 10 training examples. We provide the first comprehensive comparison between these approaches in small-data contexts and advocate for explicit small-data evaluations in AI research to better bridge theoretical advances with practical deployments.

  Active perception, a crucial human capability, involves setting a goal based on the current understanding of the environment and performing actions to achieve that goal. Despite significant efforts in evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), active perception has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we propose a novel benchmark named ActiView to evaluate active perception in MLLMs. We focus on a specialized form of Visual Question Answering (VQA) that eases and quantifies the evaluation yet challenging for existing MLLMs. Meanwhile, intermediate reasoning behaviors of models are also discussed. Given an image, we restrict the perceptual field of a model, requiring it to actively zoom or shift its perceptual field based on reasoning to answer the question successfully. We conduct extensive evaluation over 30 models, including proprietary and open-source models, and observe that restricted perceptual fields play a significant role in enabling active perception. Results reveal a significant gap in the active perception capability of MLLMs, indicating that this area deserves more attention. We hope that ActiView could help develop methods for MLLMs to understand multimodal inputs in more natural and holistic ways.

  Video detailed captioning is a key task which aims to generate comprehensive and coherent textual descriptions of video content, benefiting both video understanding and generation. In this paper, we propose AuroraCap, a video captioner based on a large multimodal model. We follow the simplest architecture design without additional parameters for temporal modeling. To address the overhead caused by lengthy video sequences, we implement the token merging strategy, reducing the number of input visual tokens. Surprisingly, we found that this strategy results in little performance loss. AuroraCap shows superior performance on various video and image captioning benchmarks, for example, obtaining a CIDEr of 88.9 on Flickr30k, beating GPT-4V (55.3) and Gemini-1.5 Pro (82.2). However, existing video caption benchmarks only include simple descriptions, consisting of a few dozen words, which limits research in this field. Therefore, we develop VDC, a video detailed captioning benchmark with over one thousand carefully annotated structured captions. In addition, we propose a new LLM-assisted metric VDCscore for bettering evaluation, which adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy to transform long caption evaluation into multiple short question-answer pairs. With the help of human Elo ranking, our experiments show that this benchmark better correlates with human judgments of video detailed captioning quality.

  Image captioning systems are unable to generate fine-grained captions as they are trained on data that is either noisy (alt-text) or generic (human annotations). This is further exacerbated by maximum likelihood training that encourages generation of frequently occurring phrases. Previous works have tried to address this limitation by fine-tuning captioners with a self-retrieval (SR) reward. However, we find that SR fine-tuning has a tendency to reduce caption faithfulness and even hallucinate. In this work, we circumvent this bottleneck by improving the MLE initialization of the captioning system and designing a curriculum for the SR fine-tuning process. To this extent, we present (1) Visual Caption Boosting, a novel framework to instill fine-grainedness in generic image captioning datasets while remaining anchored in human annotations; and (2) BagCurri, a carefully designed training curriculum that more optimally leverages the contrastive nature of the self-retrieval reward. Jointly, they enable the captioner to describe fine-grained aspects in the image while preserving faithfulness to ground-truth captions. Our approach outperforms previous work by +8.9% on SR against 99 random distractors (RD100) (Dessi et al., 2023); and +7.6% on ImageCoDe. Additionally, existing metrics to evaluate captioning systems fail to reward diversity or evaluate a model's fine-grained understanding ability. Our third contribution addresses this by proposing self-retrieval from the lens of evaluation. We introduce TrueMatch, a benchmark comprising bags of highly similar images that uses SR to assess the captioner's ability to capture subtle visual distinctions. We evaluate and compare several state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs on TrueMatch, and find that our SR approach outperforms them all by a significant margin (e.g. +4.8% - 7.1% over Cambrian) while having 1-2 orders of magnitude fewer parameters.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Rehearsal-based methods mitigate this problem by retaining a small set of old data. Nevertheless, they still suffer inevitable performance loss. Although training separate experts for each task can help prevent forgetting, effectively assembling them remains a challenge. Some approaches use routers to assign tasks to experts, but in continual learning, they often require retraining for optimal performance. To address these challenges, we introduce the Sequential Ensemble of Experts (SEE) framework. SEE removes the need for an additional router, allowing each expert to independently decide whether a query should be handled. The framework employs distributed routing, and during continual fine-tuning, SEE only requires the training of new experts for incoming tasks rather than retraining the entire system. Experiments reveal that the SEE outperforms prior approaches, including multi-task learning, in continual fine-tuning. It also demonstrates remarkable generalization ability, as the expert can effectively identify out-of-distribution queries, which can then be directed to a more generalized model for resolution. This work highlights the promising potential of integrating routing and response mechanisms within each expert, paving the way for the future of distributed model ensembling.

  In this paper, we show it is possible to bypass the safety guardrails of large language models (LLMs) through a humorous prompt including the unsafe request. In particular, our method does not edit the unsafe request and follows a fixed template -- it is simple to implement and does not need additional LLMs to craft prompts. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method across different LLMs. We also show that both removing and adding more humor to our method can reduce its effectiveness -- excessive humor possibly distracts the LLM from fulfilling its unsafe request. Thus, we argue that LLM jailbreaking occurs when there is a proper balance between focus on the unsafe request and presence of humor.

  Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) presents a dual challenge of balancing parameter efficiency and model capacity. Existing methods like low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are efficient but lack flexibility, while Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures enhance model capacity at the cost of more & under-utilized parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Structural Mixture of Residual Experts (S'MoRE), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the efficiency of LoRA with the flexibility of MoE. Specifically, S'MoRE employs hierarchical low-rank decomposition of expert weights, yielding residuals of varying orders interconnected in a multi-layer structure. By routing input tokens through sub-trees of residuals, S'MoRE emulates the capacity of many experts by instantiating and assembling just a few low-rank matrices. We craft the inter-layer propagation of S'MoRE's residuals as a special type of Graph Neural Network (GNN), and prove that under similar parameter budget, S'MoRE improves "structural flexibility" of traditional MoE (or Mixture-of-LoRA) by exponential order. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that S'MoRE achieves superior fine-tuning performance, offering a transformative approach for efficient LLM adaptation.

  Sensory language expresses embodied experiences ranging from taste and sound to excitement and stomachache. This language is of interest to scholars from a wide range of domains including robotics, narratology, linguistics, and cognitive science. In this work, we explore whether language models, which are not embodied, can approximate human use of embodied language. We extend an existing corpus of parallel human and model responses to short story prompts with an additional 18,000 stories generated by 18 popular models. We find that all models generate stories that differ significantly from human usage of sensory language, but the direction of these differences varies considerably between model families. Namely, Gemini models use significantly more sensory language than humans along most axes whereas most models from the remaining five families use significantly less. Linear probes run on five models suggest that they are capable of identifying sensory language. However, we find preliminary evidence suggesting that instruction tuning may discourage usage of sensory language. Finally, to support further work, we release our expanded story dataset.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to off-topic misuse, where users may prompt these models to perform tasks beyond their intended scope. Current guardrails, which often rely on curated examples or custom classifiers, suffer from high false-positive rates, limited adaptability, and the impracticality of requiring real-world data that is not available in pre-production. In this paper, we introduce a flexible, data-free guardrail development methodology that addresses these challenges. By thoroughly defining the problem space qualitatively and passing this to an LLM to generate diverse prompts, we construct a synthetic dataset to benchmark and train off-topic guardrails that outperform heuristic approaches. Additionally, by framing the task as classifying whether the user prompt is relevant with respect to the system prompt, our guardrails effectively generalize to other misuse categories, including jailbreak and harmful prompts. Lastly, we further contribute to the field by open-sourcing both the synthetic dataset and the off-topic guardrail models, providing valuable resources for developing guardrails in pre-production environments and supporting future research and development in LLM safety.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents CLaSP, a novel model for retrieving time-series signals using natural language queries that describe signal characteristics. The ability to search time-series signals based on descriptive queries is essential in domains such as industrial diagnostics, where data scientists often need to find signals with specific characteristics. However, existing methods rely on sketch-based inputs, predefined synonym dictionaries, or domain-specific manual designs, limiting their scalability and adaptability. CLaSP addresses these challenges by employing contrastive learning to map time-series signals to natural language descriptions. Unlike prior approaches, it eliminates the need for predefined synonym dictionaries and leverages the rich contextual knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Using the TRUCE and SUSHI datasets, which pair time-series signals with natural language descriptions, we demonstrate that CLaSP achieves high accuracy in retrieving a variety of time series patterns based on natural language queries.

  We introduce CroissantLLM, a 1.3B language model pretrained on a set of 3T English and French tokens, to bring to the research and industrial community a high-performance, fully open-sourced bilingual model that runs swiftly on consumer-grade local hardware. To that end, we pioneer the approach of training an intrinsically bilingual model with a 1:1 English-to-French pretraining data ratio, a custom tokenizer, and bilingual finetuning datasets. We release the training dataset, notably containing a French split with manually curated, high-quality, and varied data sources. To assess performance outside of English, we craft a novel benchmark, FrenchBench, consisting of an array of classification and generation tasks, covering various orthogonal aspects of model performance in the French Language. Additionally, rooted in transparency and to foster further Large Language Model research, we release codebases, and dozens of checkpoints across various model sizes, training data distributions, and training steps, as well as fine-tuned Chat models, and strong translation models. We evaluate our model through the FMTI framework, and validate 81 % of the transparency criteria, far beyond the scores of even most open initiatives. This work enriches the NLP landscape, breaking away from previous English-centric work in order to strengthen our understanding of multilinguality in language models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite great performance on Olympiad-level reasoning problems, frontier large language models can still struggle on high school math when presented with novel problems outside standard benchmarks. Going beyond final accuracy, we propose a deductive consistency metric to analyze chain-of-thought output from language models (LMs).Formally, deductive reasoning involves two subtasks: understanding a set of input premises and inferring the conclusions that follow from them. The proposed metric studies LMs' performance on these subtasks, with the goal of explaining LMs' reasoning errors on novel problems: how well do LMs understand input premises with increasing context lengths, and how well can they infer conclusions over multiple reasoning hops? Since existing benchmarks may be memorized, we develop a pipeline to evaluate LMs' deductive consistency on novel, perturbed versions of benchmark problems. On novel grade school math problems (GSM-8k), we find that LMs are fairly robust to increasing number of input premises, but suffer significant accuracy decay as the number of reasoning hops is increased. Interestingly, these errors are masked in the original benchmark as all models achieve near 100% accuracy. As we increase the number of solution steps using a synthetic dataset, prediction over multiple hops still remains the major source of error compared to understanding input premises. Other factors, such as shifts in language style or natural propagation of early errors do not explain the trends. Our analysis provides a new view to characterize LM reasoning -- as computations over a window of input premises and reasoning hops -- that can provide unified evaluation across problem domains.

  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in a wide range of natural language applications. However, they often struggle to recognize low-resource languages, in particular African languages, which are not well represented in large training corpora. In this paper, we consider how to adapt LLMs to low-resource African languages. We find that combining curated data from African languages with high-quality English educational texts results in a training mix that substantially improves the model's performance on these languages. On the challenging IrokoBench dataset, our models consistently achieve the best performance amongst similarly sized baselines, particularly on knowledge-intensive multiple-choice questions (AfriMMLU). Additionally, on the cross-lingual question answering benchmark AfriQA, our models outperform the base model by over 10%. To better understand the role of English data during training, we translate a subset of 200M tokens into Swahili language and perform an analysis which reveals that the content of these data is primarily responsible for the strong performance. We release our models and data to encourage future research on African languages.

  Recent advances in large-scale generative language models have shown that reasoning capabilities can significantly improve model performance across a variety of tasks. However, the impact of reasoning on a model's ability to mitigate stereotypical responses remains largely underexplored. In this work, we investigate the crucial relationship between a model's reasoning ability and fairness, and ask whether improved reasoning capabilities can mitigate harmful stereotypical responses, especially those arising due to shallow or flawed reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multiple open-source LLMs, and find that larger models with stronger reasoning abilities exhibit substantially lower stereotypical bias on existing fairness benchmarks. Building on this insight, we introduce ReGiFT -- Reasoning Guided Fine-Tuning, a novel approach that extracts structured reasoning traces from advanced reasoning models and infuses them into models that lack such capabilities. We use only general-purpose reasoning and do not require any fairness-specific supervision for bias mitigation. Notably, we see that models fine-tuned using ReGiFT not only improve fairness relative to their non-reasoning counterparts but also outperform advanced reasoning models on fairness benchmarks. We also analyze how variations in the correctness of the reasoning traces and their length influence model fairness and their overall performance. Our findings highlight that enhancing reasoning capabilities is an effective, fairness-agnostic strategy for mitigating stereotypical bias caused by reasoning flaws.

  While test-time reasoning enables language models to tackle complex tasks, searching or planning in natural language can be slow, costly, and error-prone. But even when LMs struggle to emulate the precise reasoning steps needed to solve a problem, they often excel at describing its abstract structure--both how to verify solutions and how to search for them. This paper introduces DisCIPL, a method for "self-steering" LMs where a Planner model generates a task-specific inference program that is executed by a population of Follower models. Our approach equips LMs with the ability to write recursive search procedures that guide LM inference, enabling new forms of verifiable and efficient reasoning. When instantiated with a small Follower (e.g., Llama-3.2-1B), DisCIPL matches (and sometimes outperforms) much larger models, including GPT-4o and o1, on challenging constrained generation tasks. In decoupling planning from execution, our work opens up a design space of highly-parallelized Monte Carlo inference strategies that outperform standard best-of-N sampling, require no finetuning, and can be implemented automatically by existing LMs.

  This paper introduces a comprehensive system for detecting hallucinations in large language model (LLM) outputs in enterprise settings. We present a novel taxonomy of LLM responses specific to hallucination in enterprise applications, categorizing them into context-based, common knowledge, enterprise-specific, and innocuous statements. Our hallucination detection model HDM-2 validates LLM responses with respect to both context and generally known facts (common knowledge). It provides both hallucination scores and word-level annotations, enabling precise identification of problematic content. To evaluate it on context-based and common-knowledge hallucinations, we introduce a new dataset HDMBench. Experimental results demonstrate that HDM-2 out-performs existing approaches across RagTruth, TruthfulQA, and HDMBench datasets. This work addresses the specific challenges of enterprise deployment, including computational efficiency, domain specialization, and fine-grained error identification. Our evaluation dataset, model weights, and inference code are publicly available.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown substantial capacity for generating fluent, contextually appropriate responses. However, they can produce hallucinated outputs, especially when a user query includes one or more false premises-claims that contradict established facts. Such premises can mislead LLMs into offering fabricated or misleading details. Existing approaches include pretraining, fine-tuning, and inference-time techniques that often rely on access to logits or address hallucinations after they occur. These methods tend to be computationally expensive, require extensive training data, or lack proactive mechanisms to prevent hallucination before generation, limiting their efficiency in real-time applications. We propose a retrieval-based framework that identifies and addresses false premises before generation. Our method first transforms a user's query into a logical representation, then applies retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to assess the validity of each premise using factual sources. Finally, we incorporate the verification results into the LLM's prompt to maintain factual consistency in the final output. Experiments show that this approach effectively reduces hallucinations, improves factual accuracy, and does not require access to model logits or large-scale fine-tuning.

  Despite the recent success of large language models (LLMs), LLMs are particularly challenging in long-sequence inference scenarios due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism. Inspired by the interpretability theory of feature attribution in neural network models, we observe that not all tokens have the same contribution. Based on this observation, we propose a novel token pruning framework, namely Saliency-driven Dynamic Token Pruning (SDTP), to gradually and dynamically prune redundant tokens based on the input context. Specifically, a lightweight saliency-driven prediction module is designed to estimate the importance score of each token with its hidden state, which is added to different layers of the LLM to hierarchically prune redundant tokens. Furthermore, a ranking-based optimization strategy is proposed to minimize the ranking divergence of the saliency score and the predicted importance score. Extensive experiments have shown that our framework is generalizable to various models and datasets. By hierarchically pruning 65\% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 33\% $\sim$ 47\% FLOPs and achieves speedup up to 1.75$\times$ during inference, while maintaining comparable performance. We further demonstrate that SDTP can be combined with KV cache compression method for further compression.

  Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a fundamental psychological capability that allows humans to understand and interpret the mental states of others. Humans infer others' thoughts by integrating causal cues and indirect clues from broad contextual information, often derived from past interactions. In other words, human ToM heavily relies on the understanding about the backgrounds and life stories of others. Unfortunately, this aspect is largely overlooked in existing benchmarks for evaluating machines' ToM capabilities, due to their usage of short narratives without global context, especially personal background of characters. In this paper, we verify the importance of comprehensive contextual understanding about personal backgrounds in ToM and assess the performance of LLMs in such complex scenarios. To achieve this, we introduce CharToM benchmark, comprising 1,035 ToM questions based on characters from classic novels. Our human study reveals a significant disparity in performance: the same group of educated participants performs dramatically better when they have read the novels compared to when they have not. In parallel, our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs, including the very recent o1 and DeepSeek-R1 models, show that LLMs still perform notably worse than humans, despite that they have seen these stories during pre-training. This highlights the limitations of current LLMs in capturing the nuanced contextual information required for ToM reasoning.

  Processing long contexts presents a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs). While recent advancements allow LLMs to handle much longer contexts than before (e.g., 32K or 128K tokens), it is computationally expensive and can still be insufficient for many applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is considered a promising strategy to address this problem. However, conventional RAG methods face inherent limitations because of two underlying requirements: 1) explicitly stated queries, and 2) well-structured knowledge. These conditions, however, do not hold in general long-context processing tasks.In this work, we propose MemoRAG, a novel RAG framework empowered by global memory-augmented retrieval. MemoRAG features a dual-system architecture. First, it employs a light but long-range system to create a global memory of the long context. Once a task is presented, it generates draft answers, providing useful clues for the retrieval tools to locate relevant information within the long context. Second, it leverages an expensive but expressive system, which generates the final answer based on the retrieved information. Building upon this fundamental framework, we realize the memory module in the form of KV compression, and reinforce its memorization and cluing capacity from the Generation quality's Feedback (a.k.a. RLGF). In our experiments, MemoRAG achieves superior performances across a variety of long-context evaluation tasks, not only complex scenarios where traditional RAG methods struggle, but also simpler ones where RAG is typically applied.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study explores the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate causality in causal graphs generated by conventional statistical causal discovery methods-a task traditionally reliant on manual assessment by human subject matter experts. To bridge this gap in causality assessment, LLMs are employed to evaluate the causal relationships by determining whether a causal connection between variable pairs can be inferred from textual context. Our study compares two approaches: (1) prompting-based method for zero-shot and few-shot causal inference and, (2) fine-tuning language models for the causal relation prediction task. While prompt-based LLMs have demonstrated versatility across various NLP tasks, our experiments on biomedical and general-domain datasets show that fine-tuned models consistently outperform them, achieving up to a 20.5-point improvement in F1 score-even when using smaller-parameter language models. These findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of both approaches for causal graph evaluation.

  This paper examines the role of cognitive biases in the decision-making processes of large language models (LLMs), challenging the conventional goal of eliminating all biases. When properly balanced, we show that certain cognitive biases can enhance decision-making efficiency through rational deviations and heuristic shortcuts. By introducing heuristic moderation and an abstention option, which allows LLMs to withhold responses when uncertain, we reduce error rates, improve decision accuracy, and optimize decision rates. Using the Balance Rigor and Utility (BRU) dataset, developed through expert collaboration, our findings demonstrate that targeted inspection of cognitive biases aligns LLM decisions more closely with human reasoning, enhancing reliability and suggesting strategies for future improvements. This approach offers a novel way to leverage cognitive biases to improve the practical utility of LLMs across various applications.

  Applications of generative Large Language Models LLMs are rapidly expanding across various domains, promising significant improvements in workflow efficiency and information retrieval. However, their implementation in specialized, high-stakes domains such as hazardous materials transportation is challenging due to accuracy and reliability concerns. This study evaluates the performance of three fine-tuned generative models, ChatGPT, Google's Vertex AI, and ORNL Retrieval Augmented Generation augmented LLaMA 2 and LLaMA in retrieving regulatory information essential for hazardous material transportation compliance in the United States. Utilizing approximately 40 publicly available federal and state regulatory documents, we developed 100 realistic queries relevant to route planning and permitting requirements. Responses were qualitatively rated based on accuracy, detail, and relevance, complemented by quantitative assessments of semantic similarity between model outputs. Results demonstrated that the RAG-augmented LLaMA models significantly outperformed Vertex AI and ChatGPT, providing more detailed and generally accurate information, despite occasional inconsistencies. This research introduces the first known application of RAG in transportation safety, emphasizing the need for domain-specific fine-tuning and rigorous evaluation methodologies to ensure reliability and minimize the risk of inaccuracies in high-stakes environments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity in recent years for their utility in various applications. However, they are sensitive to non-semantic changes in prompt formats, where small changes in the prompt format can lead to significant performance fluctuations. In the literature, this problem is commonly referred to as prompt brittleness. Previous research on prompt engineering has focused mainly on developing techniques for identifying the optimal prompt for specific tasks. Some studies have also explored the issue of prompt brittleness and proposed methods to quantify performance variations; however, no simple solution has been found to address this challenge. We propose Mixture of Formats (MOF), a simple and efficient technique for addressing prompt brittleness in LLMs by diversifying the styles used in the prompt few-shot examples. MOF was inspired by computer vision techniques that utilize diverse style datasets to prevent models from associating specific styles with the target variable. Empirical results show that our proposed technique reduces style-induced prompt brittleness in various LLMs while also enhancing overall performance across prompt variations and different datasets.

  Peer review is central to academic publishing, but the growing volume of submissions is straining the process. This motivates the development of computational approaches to support peer review. While each review is tailored to a specific paper, reviewers often make assessments according to certain aspects such as Novelty, which reflect the values of the research community. This alignment creates opportunities for standardizing the reviewing process, improving quality control, and enabling computational support. While prior work has demonstrated the potential of aspect analysis for peer review assistance, the notion of aspect remains poorly formalized. Existing approaches often derive aspect sets from review forms and guidelines of major NLP venues, yet data-driven methods for aspect identification are largely underexplored. To address this gap, our work takes a bottom-up approach: we propose an operational definition of aspect and develop a data-driven schema for deriving fine-grained aspects from a corpus of peer reviews. We introduce a dataset of peer reviews augmented with aspects and show how it can be used for community-level review analysis. We further show how the choice of aspects can impact downstream applications, such as LLM-generated review detection. Our results lay a foundation for a principled and data-driven investigation of review aspects, and pave the path for new applications of NLP to support peer review.

  Knowledge is fundamental to the overall capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The knowledge paradigm of a model, which dictates how it encodes and utilizes knowledge, significantly affects its performance. Despite the continuous development of LLMs under existing knowledge paradigms, issues within these frameworks continue to constrain model potential.This blog post highlight three critical open problems limiting model capabilities: (1) challenges in knowledge updating for LLMs, (2) the failure of reverse knowledge generalization (the reversal curse), and (3) conflicts in internal knowledge. We review recent progress made in addressing these issues and discuss potential general solutions. Based on observations in these areas, we propose a hypothetical paradigm based on Contextual Knowledge Scaling, and further outline implementation pathways that remain feasible within contemporary techniques. Evidence suggests this approach holds potential to address current shortcomings, serving as our vision for future model paradigms.This blog post aims to provide researchers with a brief overview of progress in LLM knowledge systems, while provide inspiration for the development of next-generation model architectures.

  Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have been demonstrated to possess intrinsic reasoning capabilities that can emerge naturally when expanding the response space. However, the neural representation mechanisms underlying these intrinsic capabilities and approaches for their optimal utilization remain inadequately understood. In this work, we make the key discovery that a simple linear classifier can effectively detect intrinsic reasoning capabilities in LLMs' activation space, particularly within specific representation types and network layers. Based on this finding, we propose a classifier-guided search framework that strategically explore a tree-structured response space. In each node expansion, the classifier serves as a scoring and ranking mechanism that efficiently allocates computational resources by identifying and prioritizing more thoughtful reasoning directions for continuation. After completing the tree expansion, we collect answers from all branches to form a candidate answer pool. We propose a branch-aggregation selection method that marginalizes over all supporting branches by aggregating their thoughtfulness scores, thereby identifying the optimal answer from the pool. Experimental results show that our framework's comprehensive exploration not only covers valid reasoning chains but also effectively identifies them, achieving significant improvements across multiple arithmetic reasoning benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning by leveraging increased test-time computation and exhibiting behaviors akin to human-like deliberation. Despite these advances, it remains an open question whether LRMs are better calibrated - particularly in their verbalized confidence - compared to instruction-tuned counterparts. In this paper, we investigate the calibration properties of LRMs trained via supervised fine-tuning distillation on long reasoning traces (henceforth SFT reasoning models) and outcome-based reinforcement learning for reasoning (henceforth RL reasoning models) across diverse domains. Our findings reveal that LRMs significantly outperform instruction-tuned models on complex reasoning tasks in both accuracy and confidence calibration. In contrast, we find surprising trends in the domain of factuality in particular. On factuality tasks, while Deepseek-R1 shows strong calibration behavior, smaller QwQ-32B shows no improvement over instruct models; moreover, SFT reasoning models display worse calibration (greater overconfidence) compared to instruct models. Our results provide evidence for a potentially critical role of reasoning-oriented RL training in improving LLMs' capacity for generating trustworthy, self-aware outputs.

  Heterogeneous model fusion enhances the performance of LLMs by integrating the knowledge and capabilities of multiple structurally diverse models. However, existing approaches often rely solely on selecting the best output for each prompt from source models, which underutilizes their full potential due to limited source knowledge and results in sparse optimization signals. To address this limitation, we propose FuseRL, a novel two-stage framework comprising FuseSFT and FusePO to maximize the utilization of source LLMs. FuseSFT establishes a robust initialization by integrating the strengths of heterogeneous source models through weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on diverse outputs for each prompt. FusePO optimizes weighted preferences based on the outputs of multiple source models to enable superior alignment performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework across various preference alignment methods, including RLOO, DPO, and SimPO. Using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as the target model, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among 8B LLMs on the AlpacaEval-2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks. Further analysis suggests that FuseSFT regularizes the training process to reduce overfitting, while FusePO introduces dense and diverse signals for preference optimization.

  Processing structured tabular data, particularly lengthy tables, constitutes a fundamental yet challenging task for large language models (LLMs). However, existing long-context benchmarks primarily focus on unstructured text, neglecting the challenges of long and complex structured tables. To address this gap, we introduce NeedleInATable (NIAT), a novel task that treats each table cell as a "needle" and requires the model to extract the target cell under different queries. Evaluation results of mainstream LLMs on this benchmark show they lack robust long-table comprehension, often relying on superficial correlations or shortcuts for complex table understanding tasks, revealing significant limitations in processing intricate tabular data. To this end, we propose a data synthesis method to enhance models' long-table comprehension capabilities. Experimental results show that our synthesized training data significantly enhances LLMs' performance on the NIAT task, outperforming both long-context LLMs and long-table agent methods. This work advances the evaluation of LLMs' genuine long-structured table comprehension capabilities and paves the way for progress in long-context and table understanding applications.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are now increasingly widely used to simulate personas in virtual environments, leveraging their instruction-following capability. However, we discovered that even state-of-the-art LLMs cannot simulate personas with reversed performance (e.g., student personas with low proficiency in educational settings), which impairs the simulation diversity and limits the practical applications of the simulated environments. In this work, using mathematical reasoning as a representative scenario, we propose the first benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs on simulating personas with reversed performance, a capability that we dub "counterfactual instruction following". We evaluate both open-weight and closed-source LLMs on this task and find that LLMs, including the OpenAI o1 reasoning model, all struggle to follow counterfactual instructions for simulating reversedly performing personas. Intersectionally simulating both the performance level and the race population of a persona worsens the effect even further. These results highlight the challenges of counterfactual instruction following and the need for further research.

  Query understanding in Conversational Information Seeking (CIS) involves accurately interpreting user intent through context-aware interactions. This includes resolving ambiguities, refining queries, and adapting to evolving information needs. Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance this process by interpreting nuanced language and adapting dynamically, improving the relevance and precision of search results in real-time. In this tutorial, we explore advanced techniques to enhance query understanding in LLM-based CIS systems. We delve into LLM-driven methods for developing robust evaluation metrics to assess query understanding quality in multi-turn interactions, strategies for building more interactive systems, and applications like proactive query management and query reformulation. We also discuss key challenges in integrating LLMs for query understanding in conversational search systems and outline future research directions. Our goal is to deepen the audience's understanding of LLM-based conversational query understanding and inspire discussions to drive ongoing advancements in this field.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential as tools for scientific discovery. This has engendered growing interest in their use in humanistic disciplines, such as historical linguistics and literary studies. These fields often construct arguments on the basis of delineations like genre, or more inflexibly, time period. Although efforts have been made to restrict inference to specific domains via fine-tuning or model editing, we posit that the only true guarantee is domain-restricted pretraining -- typically, a data- and compute-expensive proposition.We show that efficient pretraining techniques can produce useful models over corpora too large for easy manual inspection but too small for "typical" LLM approaches. We employ a novel date-attribution pipeline in order to obtain a temporally-segmented dataset of five 10-million-word slices. We train two corresponding five-model batteries over these corpus segments, efficient pretraining and Llama3-8B parameter efficiently finetuned.We find that the pretrained models are faster to train than the finetuned baselines and that they better respect the historical divisions of our corpus. Emphasizing speed and precision over a-historical comprehensiveness enables a number of novel approaches to hypothesis discovery and testing in our target fields. Taking up diachronic linguistics as a testbed, we show that our method enables the detection of a diverse set of phenomena, including en masse lexical change, non-lexical (grammatical and morphological) change, and word sense introduction/obsolescence. We provide a ready-to-use pipeline that allows extension of our approach to other target fields with only minimal adaptation.

  This study explores the generation and evaluation of synthetic fake news through fact based manipulations using large language models (LLMs). We introduce a novel methodology that extracts key facts from real articles, modifies them, and regenerates content to simulate fake news while maintaining coherence. To assess the quality of the generated content, we propose a set of evaluation metrics coherence, dissimilarity, and correctness. The research also investigates the application of synthetic data in fake news classification, comparing traditional machine learning models with transformer based models such as BERT. Our experiments demonstrate that transformer models, especially BERT, effectively leverage synthetic data for fake news detection, showing improvements with smaller proportions of synthetic data. Additionally, we find that fact verification features, which focus on identifying factual inconsistencies, provide the most promising results in distinguishing synthetic fake news. The study highlights the potential of synthetic data to enhance fake news detection systems, offering valuable insights for future research and suggesting that targeted improvements in synthetic data generation can further strengthen detection models.

  Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for their safe and reliable deployment, particularly in critical applications where incorrect outputs can have serious consequences. Current UQ methods typically rely on querying the model multiple times using non-zero temperature sampling to generate diverse outputs for uncertainty estimation. However, the impact of selecting a given temperature parameter is understudied, and our analysis reveals that temperature plays a fundamental role in the quality of uncertainty estimates. The conventional approach of identifying optimal temperature values requires expensive hyperparameter optimization (HPO) that must be repeated for each new model-dataset combination. We propose Monte Carlo Temperature (MCT), a robust sampling strategy that eliminates the need for temperature calibration. Our analysis reveals that: 1) MCT provides more robust uncertainty estimates across a wide range of temperatures, 2) MCT improves the performance of UQ methods by replacing fixed-temperature strategies that do not rely on HPO, and 3) MCT achieves statistical parity with oracle temperatures, which represent the ideal outcome of a well-tuned but computationally expensive HPO process. These findings demonstrate that effective UQ can be achieved without the computational burden of temperature parameter calibration.

  Modern large language models (LLMs) employ various forms of logical inference, both implicitly and explicitly, when addressing reasoning tasks. Understanding how to optimally leverage these inference paradigms is critical for advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper adopts an exploratory approach by introducing a controlled evaluation environment for analogical reasoning -- a fundamental cognitive task -- that is systematically parameterized across three dimensions: modality (textual, visual, symbolic), difficulty (easy, medium, hard), and task format (multiple-choice or free-text generation). We analyze the comparative dynamics of inductive, abductive, and deductive inference pipelines across these dimensions, and demonstrate that our findings generalize to broader in-context learning tasks. Additionally, we investigate advanced paradigms such as hypothesis selection, verification, and refinement, revealing their potential to scale up logical inference in LLM reasoning. This exploratory study provides a foundation for future research in enhancing LLM reasoning through systematic logical inference strategies. Resources are available atthis https URL.

  Recent work has developed optimization procedures to find token sequences, called adversarial triggers, which can elicit unsafe responses from aligned language models. These triggers are believed to be highly transferable, i.e., a trigger optimized on one model can jailbreak other models. In this paper, we concretely show that such adversarial triggers are not consistently transferable. We extensively investigate trigger transfer amongst 13 open models and observe poor and inconsistent transfer. Our experiments further reveal a significant difference in robustness to adversarial triggers between models Aligned by Preference Optimization (APO) and models Aligned by Fine-Tuning (AFT). We find that APO models are extremely hard to jailbreak even when the trigger is optimized directly on the model. On the other hand, while AFT models may appear safe on the surface, exhibiting refusals to a range of unsafe instructions, we show that they are highly susceptible to adversarial triggers. Lastly, we observe that most triggers optimized on AFT models also generalize to new unsafe instructions from five diverse domains, further emphasizing their vulnerability. Overall, our work highlights the need for more comprehensive safety evaluations for aligned language models.

  Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks. Still, they face limitations in tasks requiring specific, structured knowledge, flexibility, or accountable decision-making. While agents are capable of perceiving their environments, forming inferences, planning, and executing actions towards goals, they often face issues such as hallucinations and lack of contextual memory across interactions. This paper explores how Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), a strategy that solves new problems by referencing past experiences, can be integrated into LLM agent frameworks. This integration allows LLMs to leverage explicit knowledge, enhancing their effectiveness. We systematically review the theoretical foundations of these enhanced agents, identify critical framework components, and formulate a mathematical model for the CBR processes of case retrieval, adaptation, and learning. We also evaluate CBR-enhanced agents against other methods like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation, analyzing their relative strengths. Moreover, we explore how leveraging CBR's cognitive dimensions (including self-reflection, introspection, and curiosity) via goal-driven autonomy mechanisms can further enhance the LLM agent capabilities. Contributing to the ongoing research on neuro-symbolic hybrid systems, this work posits CBR as a viable technique for enhancing the reasoning skills and cognitive aspects of autonomous LLM agents.

  We find that the response length of reasoning LLMs, whether trained by reinforcement learning or supervised learning, drastically increases for ill-posed questions with missing premises (MiP), ending up with redundant and ineffective thinking. This newly introduced scenario exacerbates the general overthinking issue to a large extent, which we name as the MiP-Overthinking. Such failures are against the ``test-time scaling law'' but have been widely observed on multiple datasets we curated with MiP, indicating the harm of cheap overthinking and a lack of critical thinking. Surprisingly, LLMs not specifically trained for reasoning exhibit much better performance on the MiP scenario, producing much shorter responses that quickly identify ill-posed queries. This implies a critical flaw of the current training recipe for reasoning LLMs, which does not encourage efficient thinking adequately, leading to the abuse of thinking patterns. To further investigate the reasons behind such failures, we conduct fine-grained analyses of the reasoning length, overthinking patterns, and location of critical thinking on different types of LLMs. Moreover, our extended ablation study reveals that the overthinking is contagious through the distillation of reasoning models' responses. These results improve the understanding of overthinking and shed novel insights into mitigating the problem.

  The scientific research paradigm is undergoing a profound transformation owing to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent works demonstrate that various AI-assisted research methods can largely improve research efficiency by improving data analysis, accelerating computation, and fostering novel idea generation. To further move towards the ultimate goal (i.e., automatic scientific research), in this paper, we introduce Dolphin, a closed-loop LLM-driven framework to enhance the automation level of scientific research. Dolphin first generates novel ideas based on feedback from previous experiments and relevant papers ranked by the topic and task attributes. Then, the generated ideas can be implemented using a code template refined and debugged with the designed exception-traceback-guided local code structure. Finally, Dolphin automatically analyzes the results of each idea and feeds the results back to the next round of idea generation. Experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets of different topics and a subset of MLE-bench. Results show that Dolphin can continuously improve the performance of the input topic in a loop. We highlight that Dolphin can automatically propose methods that are comparable to the state-of-the-art in some tasks such as 3D point classification.

  The integration of tool learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) has expanded their capabilities in handling complex tasks by leveraging external tools. However, existing benchmarks for tool learning inadequately address critical real-world personalized scenarios, particularly those requiring multi-hop reasoning and inductive knowledge adaptation in dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce FamilyTool, a novel benchmark grounded in a family-based knowledge graph (KG) that simulates personalized, multi-hop tool use scenarios. FamilyTool challenges LLMs with queries spanning 1 to 3 relational hops (e.g., inferring familial connections and preferences) and incorporates an inductive KG setting where models must adapt to unseen user preferences and relationships without re-training, a common limitation in prior approaches that compromises generalization. We further propose KGETool: a simple KG-augmented evaluation pipeline to systematically assess LLMs' tool use ability in these settings. Experiments reveal significant performance gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, with accuracy dropping sharply as hop complexity increases and inductive scenarios exposing severe generalization deficits. These findings underscore the limitations of current LLMs in handling personalized, evolving real-world contexts and highlight the urgent need for advancements in tool-learning frameworks. FamilyTool serves as a critical resource for evaluating and advancing LLM agents' reasoning, adaptability, and scalability in complex, dynamic environments. Code and dataset are available at Github.

  Recent advancements in reasoning with large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated their impressive capabilities in complex domains like mathematics and coding. A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "test-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT. (3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and test-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks. By providing a structured overview, this survey aims to inspire future research and further the development of logical reasoning in artificial intelligence.

  Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising pre-screening tool, improving early disease detection and providing enhanced healthcare access for underprivileged communities. The early diagnosis of various diseases continues to be a significant challenge in healthcare, primarily due to the nonspecific nature of early symptoms, the shortage of expert medical practitioners, and the need for prolonged clinical evaluations, all of which can delay treatment and adversely affect patient outcomes. With impressive accuracy in prediction across a range of diseases, LLMs have the potential to revolutionize clinical pre-screening and decision-making for various medical conditions. In this work, we study the diagnostic capability of LLMs for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) with real world patients data. Patient data was collected alongside diagnoses from medical experts, and the performance of LLMs was evaluated in comparison to expert diagnoses for RA disease prediction. We notice an interesting pattern in disease diagnosis and find an unexpected \textit{misalignment between prediction and explanation}. We conduct a series of multi-round analyses using different LLM agents. The best-performing model accurately predicts rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diseases approximately 95\% of the time. However, when medical experts evaluated the reasoning generated by the model, they found that nearly 68\% of the reasoning was incorrect. This study highlights a clear misalignment between LLMs high prediction accuracy and its flawed reasoning, raising important questions about relying on LLM explanations in clinical settings. \textbf{LLMs provide incorrect reasoning to arrive at the correct answer for RA disease diagnosis.}

  Recent advances in automated theorem proving (ATP) through LLMs have highlighted the potential of formal reasoning with Lean 4 codes. However, ATP has not yet be revolutionized by the recent posttraining scaling as demonstrated by Open AI O1/O3 and Deepseek R1. In this work, we investigate the entire posttraining of ATP, aiming to align it with breakthroughs in reasoning models in natural languages. To begin, we continual train current ATP models with a hybrid dataset, which consists of numerous statement-proof pairs, and additional data aimed at incorporating cognitive behaviors that emulate human reasoning and hypothesis refinement. Next, we explore reinforcement learning with the use of outcome reward returned by Lean 4 compiler. Through our designed continual training and reinforcement learning processes, we have successfully improved existing formal provers, including both DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5 and Goedel-Prover, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of whole-proof generation. For example, we achieve a 59.8% pass rate (pass@32) on MiniF2F. This is an on-going project and we will progressively update our findings, release our data and training details.

  Scaling up deliberative and voting participation is a longstanding endeavor -- a cornerstone for direct democracy and legitimate collective choice. Recent breakthroughs in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) unravel new capabilities for AI personal assistants to overcome cognitive bandwidth limitations of humans, providing decision support or even direct representation of human voters at large scale. However, the quality of this representation and what underlying biases manifest when delegating collective decision-making to LLMs is an alarming and timely challenge to tackle. By rigorously emulating with high realism more than >50K LLM voting personas in 306 real-world voting elections, we disentangle the nature of different biases in LLMS (GPT 3, GPT 3.5, and Llama2). Complex preferential ballot formats exhibit significant inconsistencies compared to simpler majoritarian elections that show higher consistency. Strikingly though, by demonstrating for the first time in real-world a proportional representation of voters in direct democracy, we are also able to show that fair ballot aggregation methods, such as equal shares, prove to be a win-win: fairer voting outcomes for humans with fairer AI representation, especially for voters who are likely to abstain. This novel underlying relationship proves paramount for democratic resilience in progressives scenarios with low voters turnout and voter fatigue supported by AI representatives: abstained voters are mitigated by recovering highly representative voting outcomes that are fairer. These interdisciplinary insights provide remarkable foundations for science, policymakers, and citizens to develop safeguards and resilience for AI risks in democratic innovations.
