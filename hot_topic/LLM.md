- **[HCRMP: A LLM-Hinted Contextual Reinforcement Learning Framework for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15793)**  `arXiv:2505.15793`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance autonomous driving (AD) performance in complex scenarios. However, current LLM-Dominated RL methods over-rely on LLM outputs, which are prone to hallucinations. Evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM indicates a non-hallucination rate of only approximately 57.95% when assessed on essential driving-related tasks. Thus, in these methods, hallucinations from the LLM can directly jeopardize the performance of driving policies. This paper argues that maintaining relative independence between the LLM and the RL is vital for solving the hallucinations problem. Consequently, this paper is devoted to propose a novel LLM-Hinted RL paradigm. The LLM is used to generate semantic hints for state augmentation and policy optimization to assist RL agent in motion planning, while the RL agent counteracts potential erroneous semantic indications through policy learning to achieve excellent driving performance. Based on this paradigm, we propose the HCRMP (LLM-Hinted Contextual Reinforcement Learning Motion Planner) architecture, which is designed that includes Augmented Semantic Representation Module to extend state space. Contextual Stability Anchor Module enhances the reliability of multi-critic weight hints by utilizing information from the knowledge base. Semantic Cache Module is employed to seamlessly integrate LLM low-frequency guidance with RL high-frequency control. Extensive experiments in CARLA validate HCRMP's strong overall driving performance. HCRMP achieves a task success rate of up to 80.3% under diverse driving conditions with different traffic densities. Under safety-critical driving conditions, HCRMP significantly reduces the collision rate by 11.4%, which effectively improves the driving performance in complex scenarios.

- **[Human-like Semantic Navigation for Autonomous Driving using Knowledge Representation and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16498)**  `arXiv:2505.16498`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Achieving full automation in self-driving vehicles remains a challenge, especially in dynamic urban environments where navigation requires real-time adaptability. Existing systems struggle to handle navigation plans when faced with unpredictable changes in road layouts, spontaneous detours, or missing map data, due to their heavy reliance on predefined cartographic information. In this work, we explore the use of Large Language Models to generate Answer Set Programming rules by translating informal navigation instructions into structured, logic-based reasoning. ASP provides non-monotonic reasoning, allowing autonomous vehicles to adapt to evolving scenarios without relying on predefined maps. We present an experimental evaluation in which LLMs generate ASP constraints that encode real-world urban driving logic into a formal knowledge representation. By automating the translation of informal navigation instructions into logical rules, our method improves adaptability and explainability in autonomous navigation. Results show that LLM-driven ASP rule generation supports semantic-based decision-making, offering an explainable framework for dynamic navigation planning that aligns closely with how humans communicate navigational intent.

  Agents powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse complex applications. Recently, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), wherein multiple agents collaborate and communicate with each other, have exhibited enhanced capabilities in complex tasks, such as high-quality code generation and arithmetic reasoning. However, the development of such systems often relies on handcrafted methods, and the literature on systematic design and optimization of LLM-based MAS remains limited.In this work, we introduce OMAC, a general framework designed for holistic optimization of LLM-based MAS. Specifically, we identify five key optimization dimensions for MAS, encompassing both agent functionality and collaboration structure. Building upon these dimensions, we first propose a general algorithm, utilizing two actors termed the Semantic Initializer and the Contrastive Comparator, to optimize any single dimension. Then, we present an algorithm for joint optimization across multiple dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of OMAC on code generation, arithmetic reasoning, and general reasoning tasks against state-of-the-art approaches.

- **[QLLM: Do We Really Need a Mixing Network for Credit Assignment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12961)**  `arXiv:2504.12961`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhouyang Jiang, Bin Zhang, Airong Wei, Zhiwei Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Credit assignment has remained a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Previous studies have primarily addressed this issue through value decomposition methods under the centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm, where neural networks are utilized to approximate the nonlinear relationship between individual Q-values and the global Q-value. Although these approaches have achieved considerable success in various benchmark tasks, they still suffer from several limitations, including imprecise attribution of contributions, limited interpretability, and poor scalability in high-dimensional state spaces. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm, \textbf{QLLM}, which facilitates the automatic construction of credit assignment functions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the concept of \textbf{TFCAF} is introduced, wherein the credit allocation process is represented as a direct and expressive nonlinear functional formulation. A custom-designed \textit{coder-evaluator} framework is further employed to guide the generation, verification, and refinement of executable code by LLMs, significantly mitigating issues such as hallucination and shallow reasoning during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on several standard MARL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, QLLM exhibits strong generalization capability and maintains compatibility with a wide range of MARL algorithms that utilize mixing networks, positioning it as a promising and versatile solution for complex multi-agent scenarios.

- **[Is Your LLM-Based Multi-Agent a Reliable Real-World Planner? Exploring Fraud Detection in Travel Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16557)**  `arXiv:2505.16557`  `cs.MA`  
  _Junchi Yao, Jianhua Xu, Tianyu Xin, Ziyi Wang, Shenzhe Zhu, Shu Yang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rise of Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Planning has leveraged advanced frameworks to enable autonomous and collaborative task execution. Some systems rely on platforms like review sites and social media, which are prone to fraudulent information, such as fake reviews or misleading descriptions. This reliance poses risks, potentially causing financial losses and harming user experiences. To evaluate the risk of planning systems in real-world applications, we introduce \textbf{WandaPlan}, an evaluation environment mirroring real-world data and injected with deceptive content. We assess system performance across three fraud cases: Misinformation Fraud, Team-Coordinated Multi-Person Fraud, and Level-Escalating Multi-Round Fraud. We reveal significant weaknesses in existing frameworks that prioritize task efficiency over data authenticity. At the same time, we validate WandaPlan's generalizability, capable of assessing the risks of real-world open-source planning frameworks. To mitigate the risk of fraud, we propose integrating an anti-fraud agent, providing a solution for reliable planning.

- **[LLaDA-V: Large Language Diffusion Models with Visual Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16933)**  `arXiv:2505.16933`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL` `cs.CV`  
  _Zebin You, Shen Nie, Xiaolu Zhang, Jun Hu, Jun Zhou, Zhiwu Lu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we introduce LLaDA-V, a purely diffusion-based Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates visual instruction tuning with masked diffusion models, representing a departure from the autoregressive paradigms dominant in current multimodal approaches. Built upon LLaDA, a representative large language diffusion model, LLaDA-V incorporates a vision encoder and MLP connector that projects visual features into the language embedding space, enabling effective multimodal alignment. Our empirical investigation reveals several intriguing results: First, LLaDA-V demonstrates promising multimodal performance despite its language model being weaker on purely textual tasks than counterparts like LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B. When trained on the same instruction data, LLaDA-V is highly competitive to LLaMA3-V across multimodal tasks with better data scalability. It also narrows the performance gap to Qwen2-VL, suggesting the effectiveness of its architecture for multimodal tasks. Second, LLaDA-V achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal understanding compared to existing hybrid autoregressive-diffusion and purely diffusion-based MLLMs. Our findings suggest that large language diffusion models show promise in multimodal contexts and warrant further investigation in future research.

- **[UFT: Unifying Supervised and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16984)**  `arXiv:2505.16984`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Mingyang Liu, Gabriele Farina, Asuman Ozdaglar_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Post-training has demonstrated its importance in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The primary post-training methods can be categorized into supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). SFT is efficient and well-suited for small language models, but it may lead to overfitting and limit the reasoning abilities of larger models. In contrast, RFT generally yields better generalization but depends heavily on the strength of the base model. To address the limitations of SFT and RFT, we propose Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), a novel post-training paradigm that unifies SFT and RFT into a single, integrated process. UFT enables the model to effectively explore solutions while incorporating informative supervision signals, bridging the gap between memorizing and thinking underlying existing methods. Notably, UFT outperforms both SFT and RFT in general, regardless of model sizes. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that UFT breaks RFT's inherent exponential sample complexity bottleneck, showing for the first time that unified training can exponentially accelerate convergence on long-horizon reasoning tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are introducing a paradigm shift in molecular discovery by enabling text-guided interaction with chemical spaces through natural language, symbolic notations, with emerging extensions to incorporate multi-modal inputs. To advance the new field of LLM for molecular discovery, this survey provides an up-to-date and forward-looking review of the emerging use of LLMs for two central tasks: molecule generation and molecule optimization. Based on our proposed taxonomy for both problems, we analyze representative techniques in each category, highlighting how LLM capabilities are leveraged across different learning settings. In addition, we include the commonly used datasets and evaluation protocols. We conclude by discussing key challenges and future directions, positioning this survey as a resource for researchers working at the intersection of LLMs and molecular science.

- **[Similarity-Distance-Magnitude Universal Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20167)**  `arXiv:2502.20167`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Allen Schmaltz_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We address the neural network robustness problem by adding Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training)-awareness and Distance-to-training-distribution-awareness to the existing output Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary)-awareness of the softmax function. The resulting SDM activation function provides strong signals of the relative epistemic (reducible) predictive uncertainty. We use this novel behavior to further address the complementary HCI problem of mapping the output to human-interpretable summary statistics over relevant partitions of a held-out calibration set. Estimates of prediction-conditional uncertainty are obtained via a parsimonious learned transform over the class-conditional empirical CDFs of the output of a final-layer SDM activation function. For decision-making and as an intrinsic model check, estimates of class-conditional accuracy are obtained by further partitioning the high-probability regions of this calibrated output into class-conditional, region-specific CDFs. The uncertainty estimates from SDM calibration are remarkably robust to test-time distribution shifts and out-of-distribution inputs; incorporate awareness of the effective sample size; provide estimates of uncertainty from the learning and data splitting processes; and are well-suited for selective classification and conditional branching for additional test-time compute based on the predictive uncertainty, as for selective LLM generation, routing, and composition over multiple models and retrieval. Finally, we construct SDM networks, LLMs with uncertainty-aware verification and interpretability-by-exemplar as intrinsic properties. We provide open-source software implementing these results.

- **[NQKV: A KV Cache Quantization Scheme Based on Normal Distribution Characteristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16210)**  `arXiv:2505.16210`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Zhihang Cai, Xingjun Zhang, Zhendong Tan, Zheng Wei_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across a wide range of tasks. However, LLMs often require larger batch sizes to enhance throughput or longer context lengths to meet task demands, which significantly increases the memory resource consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache during inference, becoming a major bottleneck in LLM deployment. To address this issue, quantization is a common and straightforward approach. Currently, quantization methods for activations are limited to 8-bit, and quantization to even lower bits can lead to substantial accuracy drops. To further save space by quantizing the KV cache to even lower bits, we analyzed the element distribution of the KV cache and designed the NQKV algorithm. Since the elements within each block of the KV cache follow a normal distribution, NQKV employs per-block quantile quantization to achieve information-theoretically optimal quantization error. Without significantly compromising model output quality, NQKV enables the OPT model to perform inference with an 2x larger batch size or a 4x longer context length, and it improves throughput by 9.3x compared to when the KV cache is not used.

- **[Interpretability Illusions with Sparse Autoencoders: Evaluating Robustness of Concept Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16004)**  `arXiv:2505.16004`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Aaron J. Li, Suraj Srinivas, Usha Bhalla, Himabindu Lakkaraju_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are commonly used to interpret the internal activations of large language models (LLMs) by mapping them to human-interpretable concept representations. While existing evaluations of SAEs focus on metrics such as the reconstruction-sparsity tradeoff, human (auto-)interpretability, and feature disentanglement, they overlook a critical aspect: the robustness of concept representations to input perturbations. We argue that robustness must be a fundamental consideration for concept representations, reflecting the fidelity of concept labeling. To this end, we formulate robustness quantification as input-space optimization problems and develop a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring realistic scenarios in which adversarial perturbations are crafted to manipulate SAE representations. Empirically, we find that tiny adversarial input perturbations can effectively manipulate concept-based interpretations in most scenarios without notably affecting the outputs of the base LLMs themselves. Overall, our results suggest that SAE concept representations are fragile and may be ill-suited for applications in model monitoring and oversight.

  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by optimizing their policies with reward signals. Yet, RL's success relies on the reliability of rewards, which are provided by verifiers. In this paper, we expose and analyze a widespread problem--false negatives--where verifiers wrongly reject correct model outputs. Our in-depth study of the Big-Math-RL-Verified dataset reveals that over 38% of model-generated responses suffer from false negatives, where the verifier fails to recognize correct answers. We show, both empirically and theoretically, that these false negatives severely impair RL training by depriving the model of informative gradient signals and slowing convergence. To mitigate this, we propose tinyV, a lightweight LLM-based verifier that augments existing rule-based methods, which dynamically identifies potential false negatives and recovers valid responses to produce more accurate reward estimates. Across multiple math-reasoning benchmarks, integrating TinyV boosts pass rates by up to 10% and accelerates convergence relative to the baseline. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing verifier false negatives and offer a practical approach to improve RL-based fine-tuning of LLMs. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Capacity-Aware Inference: Mitigating the Straggler Effect in Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05066)**  `arXiv:2503.05066`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Shwai He, Weilin Cai, Jiayi Huang, Ang Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Mixture of Experts (MoE) is an effective architecture for scaling large language models by leveraging sparse expert activation, optimizing the trade-off between performance and efficiency. However, under expert parallelism, MoE suffers from inference inefficiencies due to imbalanced token-to-expert assignment, where some experts are overloaded while others remain underutilized. This imbalance leads to poor resource utilization and increased latency, as the most burdened expert dictates the overall delay, a phenomenon we define as the \textbf{\textit{Straggler Effect}}. To mitigate this, we propose Capacity-Aware Inference, including two key techniques: (1) \textbf{\textit{Capacity-Aware Token Drop}}, which discards overloaded tokens to regulate the maximum latency of MoE, and (2) \textbf{\textit{Capacity-Aware Token Reroute}}, which reallocates overflowed tokens to underutilized experts, balancing the token distribution. These techniques collectively optimize both high-load and low-load expert utilization, leading to a more efficient MoE inference pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, showing significant improvements in inference efficiency, e.g., 0.2\% average performance increase and a 1.94$\times$ inference speedup on Mixtral-8$\times$7B-Instruct.

- **[Steer LLM Latents for Hallucination Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01917)**  `arXiv:2503.01917`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Seongheon Park, Xuefeng Du, Min-Hsuan Yeh, Haobo Wang, Yixuan Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucinations in LLMs pose a significant concern to their safe deployment in real-world applications. Recent approaches have leveraged the latent space of LLMs for hallucination detection, but their embeddings, optimized for linguistic coherence rather than factual accuracy, often fail to clearly separate truthful and hallucinated content. To this end, we propose the Truthfulness Separator Vector (TSV), a lightweight and flexible steering vector that reshapes the LLM's representation space during inference to enhance the separation between truthful and hallucinated outputs, without altering model parameters. Our two-stage framework first trains TSV on a small set of labeled exemplars to form compact and well-separated clusters. It then augments the exemplar set with unlabeled LLM generations, employing an optimal transport-based algorithm for pseudo-labeling combined with a confidence-based filtering process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSV achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled data, exhibiting strong generalization across datasets and providing a practical solution for real-world LLM applications.

- **[How Well Can a Long Sequence Model Model Long Sequences? Comparing Architechtural Inductive Biases on Long-Context Abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08112)**  `arXiv:2407.08112`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Jerry Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long sequences occur in abundance within real-world scenarios, hence properly modelling them opens numerous down-stream use-cases. Deep neural networks, however, have often struggled with these for a variety of reasons. Recent advances, both in system engineering as well as model design, have enabled the scaling up of model that are purported to support extended context length. In particular, the state-space and linear recurrent neural network families of models hypothetically can entend to infinite sequence lenth. However, is this too good to be true? We conduct an evaluation to show that while such claims may be sound theoretically, there remain large practical gaps that are empirically observed. In particular, recurrent models still suffer in the same settings as long-context LLMs with attention. We further show that different inductive biases have inconsistent extrapolation capabilities, highlighting the need to further study such paradigms and investigate why long-context models seemingly fail to behave as one might expect.

- **[MixAT: Combining Continuous and Discrete Adversarial Training for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16947)**  `arXiv:2505.16947`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite recent efforts in Large Language Models (LLMs) safety and alignment, current adversarial attacks on frontier LLMs are still able to force harmful generations consistently. Although adversarial training has been widely studied and shown to significantly improve the robustness of traditional machine learning models, its strengths and weaknesses in the context of LLMs are less understood. Specifically, while existing discrete adversarial attacks are effective at producing harmful content, training LLMs with concrete adversarial prompts is often computationally expensive, leading to reliance on continuous relaxations. As these relaxations do not correspond to discrete input tokens, such latent training methods often leave models vulnerable to a diverse set of discrete attacks. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing MixAT, a novel method that combines stronger discrete and faster continuous attacks during training. We rigorously evaluate MixAT across a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art attacks, proposing the At Least One Attack Success Rate (ALO-ASR) metric to capture the worst-case vulnerability of models. We show MixAT achieves substantially better robustness (ALO-ASR < 20%) compared to prior defenses (ALO-ASR > 50%), while maintaining a runtime comparable to methods based on continuous relaxations. We further analyze MixAT in realistic deployment settings, exploring how chat templates, quantization, low-rank adapters, and temperature affect both adversarial training and evaluation, revealing additional blind spots in current methodologies. Our results demonstrate that MixAT's discrete-continuous defense offers a principled and superior robustness-accuracy tradeoff with minimal computational overhead, highlighting its promise for building safer LLMs. We provide our code and models atthis https URL.

- **[Training Long-Context LLMs Efficiently via Chunk-wise Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16710)**  `arXiv:2505.16710`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Wenhao Li, Yuxin Zhang, Gen Luo, Daohai Yu, Rongrong Ji_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While long-context large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable document processing capabilities, their prohibitively high training costs often hinder customized applications. To mitigate this issue, we propose \textit{Sequential Chunk-wise Optimization} (SeCO), a memory-efficient training paradigm that partitions lengthy inputs into manageable chunks. Each chunk independently constructs its computational graph and performs localized backpropagation, ensuring that only one chunk's forward activations are stored in memory. Building on SeCO, we further introduce \textit{Sparse Chunk-wise Optimization} (SpaCO), which reduces computational overhead by selectively propagating gradients to specific chunks and incorporates a carefully designed compensation factor to ensure unbiased gradient estimation. SpaCO decouples the computational cost of backpropagation from the context length, enabling training time to gradually converge to inference time as sequences become longer. Implemented as lightweight training wrappers, both SeCO and SpaCO offer substantial practical benefits. For example, when fine-tuning an 8B model with LoRA on a single RTX 3090 GPU, SeCO expands maximum sequence length from 1K to 16K tokens, while SpaCO demonstrates accelerated training speed -- achieving up to 3x faster than SeCO under the same experimental setup. These innovations provide new insights into optimizing long-context models, making them more accessible for practical applications. We have open-sourced the code at \href{this https URL}{here}.

- **[Your Pre-trained LLM is Secretly an Unsupervised Confidence Calibrator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16690)**  `arXiv:2505.16690`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Beier Luo, Shuoyuan Wang, Yixuan Li, Hongxin Wei_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks. While PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language models (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to both correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical applications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled data for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Disagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to optimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\tau$) in post-hoc confidence calibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by prediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their confidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence underestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a larger $\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by selectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively decoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an overly large $\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples, improving calibration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, improving the average ECE of open-sourced and API-based LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o) by up to 15.08$\%$ on common benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  How to design reinforcement learning (RL) tasks that effectively unleash the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) remains an open question. Existing RL tasks (e.g., math, programming, and constructing reasoning tasks) suffer from three key limitations: (1) Scalability. They rely heavily on human annotation or expensive LLM synthesis to generate sufficient training data. (2) Verifiability. LLMs' outputs are hard to verify automatically and reliably. (3) Controllable Difficulty. Most tasks lack fine-grained difficulty control, making it hard to train LLMs to develop reasoning ability from easy to hard.To address these limitations, we propose Saturn, a SAT-based RL framework that uses Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems to train and evaluate LLM reasoning. Saturn enables scalable task construction, rule-based verification, and precise difficulty control. Saturn designs a curriculum learning pipeline that continuously improves LLMs' reasoning capability by constructing SAT tasks of increasing difficulty and training LLMs from easy to hard. To ensure stable training, we design a principled mechanism to control difficulty transitions.We introduce Saturn-2.6k, a dataset of 2,660 SAT problems with varying difficulty. It supports the evaluation of how LLM reasoning changes with problem difficulty. We apply Saturn to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen and obtain Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B. We achieve several notable results: (1) On SAT problems, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B achieve average pass@3 improvements of +14.0 and +28.1, respectively. (2) On math and programming tasks, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B improve average scores by +4.9 and +1.8 on benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench). (3) Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach in constructing RL tasks, Saturn achieves further improvements of +8.8%. We release the source code, data, and models to support future research.

- **[Not All Models Suit Expert Offloading: On Local Routing Consistency of Mixture-of-Expert Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16056)**  `arXiv:2505.16056`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Jingcong Liang, Siyuan Wang, Miren Tian, Yitong Li, Duyu Tang, Zhongyu Wei_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enables efficient scaling of large language models (LLMs) with sparsely activated experts during inference. To effectively deploy large MoE models on memory-constrained devices, many systems introduce *expert offloading* that caches a subset of experts in fast memory, leaving others on slow memory to run on CPU or load on demand. While some research has exploited the locality of expert activations, where consecutive tokens activate similar experts, the degree of this **local routing consistency** varies across models and remains understudied. In this paper, we propose two metrics to measure local routing consistency of MoE models: (1) **Segment Routing Best Performance (SRP)**, which evaluates how well a fixed group of experts can cover the needs of a segment of tokens, and (2) **Segment Cache Best Hit Rate (SCH)**, which measures the optimal segment-level cache hit rate under a given cache size limit. We analyzed 20 MoE LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures and found that models that apply MoE on every layer and do not use shared experts exhibit the highest local routing consistency. We further showed that domain-specialized experts contribute more to routing consistency than vocabulary-specialized ones, and that most models can balance between cache effectiveness and efficiency with cache sizes approximately 2x the active experts. These findings pave the way for memory-efficient MoE design and deployment without compromising inference speed. We publish the code for replicating experiments atthis https URL.

- **[Multi-modal Integration Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15747)**  `arXiv:2505.15747`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel framework for integrating fragmented multi-modal data in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research using large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs. While traditional multimodal analysis requires matched patient IDs across datasets, our approach demonstrates population-level integration of MRI, gene expression, biomarkers, EEG, and clinical indicators from independent cohorts. Statistical analysis identified significant features in each modality, which were connected as nodes in a knowledge graph. LLMs then analyzed the graph to extract potential correlations and generate hypotheses in natural language. This approach revealed several novel relationships, including a potential pathway linking metabolic risk factors to tau protein abnormalities via neuroinflammation (r>0.6, p<0.001), and unexpected correlations between frontal EEG channels and specific gene expression profiles (r=0.42-0.58, p<0.01). Cross-validation with independent datasets confirmed the robustness of major findings, with consistent effect sizes across cohorts (variance <15%). The reproducibility of these findings was further supported by expert review (Cohen's k=0.82) and computational validation. Our framework enables cross modal integration at a conceptual level without requiring patient ID matching, offering new possibilities for understanding AD pathology through fragmented data reuse and generating testable hypotheses for future research.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are essential for building general-purpose AI assistants; however, they pose increasing safety risks. How can we ensure safety alignment of MLLMs to prevent undesired behaviors? Going further, it is critical to explore how to fine-tune MLLMs to preserve capabilities while meeting safety constraints. Fundamentally, this challenge can be formulated as a min-max optimization problem. However, existing datasets have not yet disentangled single preference signals into explicit safety constraints, hindering systematic investigation in this direction. Moreover, it remains an open question whether such constraints can be effectively incorporated into the optimization process for multi-modal models. In this work, we present the first exploration of the Safe RLHF-V -- the first multimodal safety alignment framework. The framework consists of: $\mathbf{(I)}$ BeaverTails-V, the first open-source dataset featuring dual preference annotations for helpfulness and safety, supplemented with multi-level safety labels (minor, moderate, severe); $\mathbf{(II)}$ Beaver-Guard-V, a multi-level guardrail system to proactively defend against unsafe queries and adversarial attacks. Applying the guard model over five rounds of filtering and regeneration significantly enhances the precursor model's overall safety by an average of 40.9%. $\mathbf{(III)}$ Based on dual preference, we initiate the first exploration of multi-modal safety alignment within a constrained optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that Safe RLHF effectively improves both model helpfulness and safety. Specifically, Safe RLHF-V enhances model safety by 34.2% and helpfulness by 34.3%.

  The predominant approach for training web navigation agents is to gather human demonstrations for a set of popular websites and hand-written tasks, but it is becoming clear that human data is an inefficient resource. We develop a pipeline to facilitate internet-scale training for agents without laborious human annotations. In the first stage, an LLM annotates 150k sites with agentic tasks. In the next stage, LLM agents complete tasks and produce trajectories. In the final stage, an LLM filters trajectories by judging their success. Language models are powerful data curation tools, identifying harmful content with an accuracy of 97%, judging successful trajectories with an accuracy of 82.6%, and producing effective data. We train agents based on Qwen 3 1.7B that are competitive with frontier LLMs as web agents, while being smaller and faster. Our top agent reaches a success rate of 56.9%, outperforming the data collection policy Qwen 3 235B, a 235 times larger Llama 4 Maverick, and reaching 94.7% of the performance of Gemini 2.5 Flash.

  Real-world time series inference requires more than point forecasting. It demands multi-step reasoning, constraint handling, domain knowledge incorporation, and domain-specific workflow assembly. Existing time series foundation models are limited to narrow tasks and lack flexibility to generalize across diverse scenarios. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) struggle with numerical precision. To address these limitations, we introduce TS-Reasoner, a Domain-Oriented Time Series Agent that integrates natural language reasoning with precise numerical execution. TS-Reasoner decomposes natural language instructions into structured workflows composed of statistical, logical, and domain-specific operators, and incorporates a self-refinement mechanism for adaptive execution. We evaluate its capabilities through two axes: basic time series understanding and complex multi-step inference, using the TimeSeriesExam benchmark and a newly constructed dataset. Experimental results show that TS-Reasoner significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs, highlighting the promise of domain-specialized agents for robust and interpretable time series reasoning.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming commodity components of larger software systems. This poses natural security and privacy problems: poisoned data retrieved from one component can change the model's behavior and compromise the entire system, including coercing the model to spread confidential data to untrusted components. One promising approach is to tackle this problem at the system level via dynamic information flow (aka taint) tracking. Unfortunately, this approach of propagating the most restrictive input label to the output is too conservative for applications where LLMs operate on inputs retrieved from diverse sources. In this paper, we propose a novel, more permissive approach to propagate information flow labels through LLM queries. The key idea behind our approach is to propagate only the labels of the samples that were influential in generating the model output and to eliminate the labels of unnecessary inputs. We implement and investigate the effectiveness of two variations of this approach, based on (i) prompt-based retrieval augmentation, and (ii) a $k$-nearest-neighbors language model. We compare these with a baseline that uses introspection to predict the output label. Our experimental results in an LLM agent setting show that the permissive label propagator improves over the baseline in more than 85% of the cases, which underscores the practicality of our approach.

  Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated considerable potential in supporting model design and optimization for combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. However, much of the progress to date has been evaluated on small-scale, synthetic datasets, raising concerns about the practical effectiveness of ML-based solvers in real-world, large-scale CO scenarios. Additionally, many existing CO benchmarks lack sufficient training data, limiting their utility for evaluating data-driven approaches. To address these limitations, we introduce FrontierCO, a comprehensive benchmark that covers eight canonical CO problem types and evaluates 16 representative ML-based solvers--including graph neural networks and large language model (LLM) agents. FrontierCO features challenging instances drawn from industrial applications and frontier CO research, offering both realistic problem difficulty and abundant training data. Our empirical results provide critical insights into the strengths and limitations of current ML methods, helping to guide more robust and practically relevant advances at the intersection of machine learning and combinatorial optimization.

  Risk-averse reinforcement learning finds application in various high-stakes fields. Unlike classical reinforcement learning, which aims to maximize expected returns, risk-averse agents choose policies that minimize risk, occasionally sacrificing expected value. These preferences can be framed through utility theory. We focus on the specific case of the exponential utility function, where we can derive the Bellman equations and employ various reinforcement learning algorithms with few modifications. However, these methods suffer from numerical instability due to the need for exponent computation throughout the process. To address this, we introduce a numerically stable and mathematically sound loss function based on the Itakura-Saito divergence for learning state-value and action-value functions. We evaluate our proposed loss function against established alternatives, both theoretically and empirically. In the experimental section, we explore multiple financial scenarios, some with known analytical solutions, and show that our loss function outperforms the alternatives.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a concise review of Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) methods and introduces an experimental framework for scalable, interpretable offer selection, addressing the challenge of fast-changing offers. The approach models context at the product category level, allowing offers to span multiple categories and enabling knowledge transfer across similar offers. This improves learning efficiency and generalization in dynamic environments. The framework extends standard CMAB methodology to support multi-category contexts, and achieves scalability through efficient feature engineering and modular design. Advanced features such as MPG (Member Purchase Gap) and MF (Matrix Factorization) capture nuanced user-offer interactions, with implementation in Python for practical deployment.A key contribution is interpretability at scale: logistic regression models yield transparent weight vectors, accessible via a large language model (LLM) interface for real-time, user-level tracking and explanation of evolving preferences. This enables the generation of detailed member profiles and identification of behavioral patterns, supporting personalized offer optimization and enhancing trust in automated decisions. By situating our prototype alongside established paradigms like Generalized Linear Models and Thompson Sampling, we demonstrate its value for both research and real-world CMAB applications.

  Prompt tuning methods for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular to address the semantic gap between pre-training and fine-tuning steps. However, existing GNN prompting methods rely on labeled data and involve lightweight fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Meanwhile, in-context learning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance with no parameter updating and no or minimal labeled data. Inspired by these approaches, in this work, we first introduce a challenging problem setup to evaluate GNN prompting methods. This setup encourages a prompting function to enhance a pre-trained GNN's generalization to a target dataset under covariate shift without updating the GNN's parameters and with no labeled data. Next, we propose a fully unsupervised prompting method based on consistency regularization through pseudo-labeling. We use two regularization techniques to align the prompted graphs' distribution with the original data and reduce biased predictions. Through extensive experiments under our problem setting, we demonstrate that our unsupervised approach outperforms the state-of-the-art prompting methods that have access to labels.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing complexity of power systems has made accurate load forecasting more important than ever. An increasing number of advanced load forecasting methods have been developed. However, the static design of current methods offers no mechanism for human-model interaction. As the primary users of forecasting models, system operators often find it difficult to understand and apply these advanced models, which typically requires expertise in artificial intelligence (AI). This also prevents them from incorporating their experience and real-world contextual understanding into the forecasting process. Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) offer a new opportunity to address this issue. By leveraging their natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent collaboration framework to bridge the gap between human operators and forecasting models. A set of specialized agents is designed to perform different tasks in the forecasting workflow and collaborate via a dedicated communication mechanism. This framework embeds interactive mechanisms throughout the load forecasting pipeline, reducing the technical threshold for non-expert users and enabling the integration of human experience. Our experiments demonstrate that the interactive load forecasting accuracy can be significantly improved when users provide proper insight in key stages. Our cost analysis shows that the framework remains affordable, making it practical for real-world deployment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable powerful cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, the expanded input space introduces new attack surfaces. Previous jailbreak attacks often inject malicious instructions from text into less aligned modalities, such as vision. As MLLMs increasingly incorporate cross-modal consistency and alignment mechanisms, such explicit attacks become easier to detect and block. In this work, we propose a novel implicit jailbreak framework termed IJA that stealthily embeds malicious instructions into images via least significant bit steganography and couples them with seemingly benign, image-related textual prompts. To further enhance attack effectiveness across diverse MLLMs, we incorporate adversarial suffixes generated by a surrogate model and introduce a template optimization module that iteratively refines both the prompt and embedding based on model feedback. On commercial models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Pro, our method achieves attack success rates of over 90% using an average of only 3 queries.

  Large language models (LLMs) have been observed to suddenly exhibit advanced reasoning abilities during reinforcement learning (RL), resembling an ``aha moment'' triggered by simple outcome-based rewards. While RL has proven effective in eliciting such breakthroughs in tasks involving mathematics, coding, and vision, it faces significant challenges in multi-scenario games. The diversity of game rules, interaction modes, and environmental complexities often leads to policies that perform well in one scenario but fail to generalize to others. Simply combining multiple scenarios during training introduces additional challenges, such as training instability and poor performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Divide-Fuse-Conquer, a framework designed to enhance generalization in multi-scenario RL. This approach starts by heuristically grouping games based on characteristics such as rules and difficulties. Specialized models are then trained for each group to excel at games in the group is what we refer to as the divide step. Next, we fuse model parameters from different groups as a new model, and continue training it for multiple groups, until the scenarios in all groups are conquered. Experiments across 18 TextArena games show that Qwen2.5-32B-Align trained with the Divide-Fuse-Conquer strategy reaches a performance level comparable to Claude3.5, achieving 7 wins and 4 draws. We hope our approach can inspire future research on using reinforcement learning to improve the generalization of LLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly recognized as powerful tools for scientific discovery, particularly in molecular science. A fundamental requirement for these models is the ability to accurately understand molecular structures, commonly encoded in the SMILES representation. However, current LLMs struggle to interpret SMILES, even failing to carry out basic tasks such as counting molecular rings. To address this limitation, we introduce CLEANMOL, a novel framework that formulates SMILES parsing into a suite of clean and deterministic tasks explicitly designed to promote graph-level molecular comprehension. These tasks span from subgraph matching to global graph matching, providing structured supervision aligned with molecular structural properties. We construct a molecular pretraining dataset with adaptive difficulty scoring and pre-train open-source LLMs on these tasks. Our results show that CLEANMOL not only enhances structural comprehension but also achieves the best or competes with the baseline on the Mol-Instructions benchmark.

  Differential Transformer has recently gained significant attention for its impressive empirical performance, often attributed to its ability to perform noise canceled attention. However, precisely how differential attention achieves its empirical benefits remains poorly understood. Moreover, Differential Transformer architecture demands large-scale training from scratch, hindering utilization of open pretrained weights. In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation of Differential Transformer, uncovering three key factors behind its success: (1) enhanced expressivity via negative attention, (2) reduced redundancy among attention heads, and (3) improved learning dynamics. Based on these findings, we propose DEX, a novel method to efficiently integrate the advantages of differential attention into pretrained language models. By reusing the softmax attention scores and adding a lightweight differential operation on the output value matrix, DEX effectively incorporates the key advantages of differential attention while remaining lightweight in both training and inference. Evaluations confirm that DEX substantially improves the pretrained LLMs across diverse benchmarks, achieving significant performance gains with minimal adaptation data (< 0.01\%).

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made impressive progress in many applications in recent years. However, chemical MLLMs that can handle cross-modal understanding and generation remain underexplored. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose ChemMLLM, a unified chemical multimodal large language model for molecule understanding and generation. Also, we design five multimodal tasks across text, molecular SMILES strings, and image, and curate the datasets. We benchmark ChemMLLM against a range of general leading MLLMs and Chemical LLMs on these tasks. Experimental results show that ChemMLLM achieves superior performance across all evaluated tasks. For example, in molecule image optimization task, ChemMLLM outperforms the best baseline (GPT-4o) by 118.9\% (4.27 vs 1.95 property improvement). The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  Attention mechanisms lie at the heart of modern large language models (LLMs). Straightforward algorithms for forward and backward (gradient) computation take quadratic time, and a line of work initiated by [Alman and Song NeurIPS 2023] and [Alman and Song NeurIPS 2024] has shown that quadratic time is necessary unless the model weights are small, in which case almost linear time algorithms are possible. In this paper, we show that large weights are necessary to avoid a strong preclusion to representational strength we call layer collapse, which means that the entire network can be approximated well by a network with only a single layer. Thus, the quadratic running time of attention is unavoidable for expressive transformers.The notion of layer collapse that we introduce is a variant on the notion of rank collapse from the work of [Dong, Cordonnier, and Loukas ICML 2021]. They showed that in Self Attention Networks with small weights and with skip connections, rank collapse must occur. This is typically interpreted as justifying the necessity of skip connections in expressive networks. However, our result shows that even with skip connections, if the weights are small, then layer collapse still occurs. Thus, only large weights, and not skip connections, can prevent these representational weaknesses.

  Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a powerful post-training paradigm for aligning large language models with human preferences. A core challenge in RLHF is constructing accurate reward signals, where the conventional Bradley-Terry reward models (BT RMs) often suffer from sensitivity to data size and coverage, as well as vulnerability to reward hacking. Generative reward models (GenRMs) offer a more robust alternative by generating chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales followed by a final reward. However, existing GenRMs rely on shallow, vertically scaled reasoning, limiting their capacity to handle nuanced or complex (e.g., reasoning-intensive) tasks. Moreover, their pairwise preference outputs are incompatible with standard RLHF algorithms that require pointwise reward signals. In this work, we introduce Think-RM, a training framework that enables long-horizon reasoning in GenRMs by modeling an internal thinking process. Rather than producing structured, externally provided rationales, Think-RM generates flexible, self-guided reasoning traces that support advanced capabilities such as self-reflection, hypothetical reasoning, and divergent reasoning. To elicit these reasoning abilities, we first warm-up the models by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over long CoT data. We then further improve the model's long-horizon abilities by rule-based reinforcement learning (RL). In addition, we propose a novel pairwise RLHF pipeline that directly optimizes policies using pairwise preference rewards, eliminating the need for pointwise reward conversion and enabling more effective use of Think-RM outputs. Experiments show that Think-RM achieves state-of-the-art results on RM-Bench, outperforming both BT RM and vertically scaled GenRM by 8%. When combined with our pairwise RLHF pipeline, it demonstrates superior end-policy performance compared to traditional approaches.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in complex reasoning tasks, but their inference remains computationally inefficient. We observe a common failure mode in many prevalent LLMs, overthinking, where models generate verbose and tangential reasoning traces even for simple queries. Recent works have tried to mitigate this by enforcing fixed token budgets, however, this can lead to underthinking, especially on harder problems. Through empirical analysis, we identify that this inefficiency often stems from unclear problem-solving strategies. To formalize this, we develop a theoretical model, BBAM (Bayesian Budget Allocation Model), which models reasoning as a sequence of sub-questions with varying uncertainty, and introduce the $E^3$ metric to capture the trade-off between correctness and computation efficiency. Building on theoretical results from BBAM, we propose Plan-and-Budget, a model-agnostic, test-time framework that decomposes complex queries into sub-questions and allocates token budgets based on estimated complexity using adaptive scheduling. Plan-and-Budget improves reasoning efficiency across a range of tasks and models, achieving up to +70% accuracy gains, -39% token reduction, and +187.5% improvement in $E^3$. Notably, it elevates a smaller model (DS-Qwen-32B) to match the efficiency of a larger model (DS-LLaMA-70B)-demonstrating Plan-and-Budget's ability to close performance gaps without retraining.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) often require external tools, such as machine learning classifiers or knowledge retrieval systems, to provide accurate answers in domains where their pre-trained knowledge is insufficient. This integration of LLMs with external tools expands their utility but also introduces a critical challenge: determining the trustworthiness of responses generated by the combined system. In high-stakes applications, such as medical decision-making, it is essential to assess the uncertainty of both the LLM's generated text and the tool's output to ensure the reliability of the final response. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods do not account for the tool-calling scenario, where both the LLM and external tool contribute to the overall system's uncertainty. In this work, we present a novel framework for modeling tool-calling LLMs that quantifies uncertainty by jointly considering the predictive uncertainty of the LLM and the external tool. We extend previous methods for uncertainty quantification over token sequences to this setting and propose efficient approximations that make uncertainty computation practical for real-world applications. We evaluate our framework on two new synthetic QA datasets, derived from well-known machine learning datasets, which require tool-calling for accurate answers. Additionally, we apply our method to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and conduct a proof-of-concept experiment demonstrating the effectiveness of our uncertainty metrics in scenarios where external information retrieval is needed. Our results show that the framework is effective in enhancing trust in LLM-based systems, especially in cases where the LLM's internal knowledge is insufficient and external tools are required.

  Machine learning (ML) models rely heavily on consistent and accurate performance metrics to evaluate and compare their effectiveness. However, existing libraries often suffer from fragmentation, inconsistent implementations, and insufficient data validation protocols, leading to unreliable results. Existing libraries have often been developed independently and without adherence to a unified standard, particularly concerning the specific tasks they aim to support. As a result, each library tends to adopt its conventions for metric computation, input/output formatting, error handling, and data validation protocols. This lack of standardization leads to both implementation differences (ID) and reporting differences (RD), making it difficult to compare results across frameworks or ensure reliable evaluations. To address these issues, we introduce AllMetrics, an open-source unified Python library designed to standardize metric evaluation across diverse ML tasks, including regression, classification, clustering, segmentation, and image-to-image translation. The library implements class-specific reporting for multi-class tasks through configurable parameters to cover all use cases, while incorporating task-specific parameters to resolve metric computation discrepancies across implementations. Various datasets from domains like healthcare, finance, and real estate were applied to our library and compared with Python, Matlab, and R components to identify which yield similar results. AllMetrics combines a modular Application Programming Interface (API) with robust input validation mechanisms to ensure reproducibility and reliability in model evaluation. This paper presents the design principles, architectural components, and empirical analyses demonstrating the ability to mitigate evaluation errors and to enhance the trustworthiness of ML workflows.

  Quantization became a necessary tool for serving ever-increasing Large Language Models (LLMs). RTN (Round-to-Nearest) is perhaps the simplest quantization technique that has been around well before LLMs surged to the forefront of machine learning (ML) research. Yet, it has been largely dismissed by recent and more advanced quantization methods that claim superiority over RTN in nearly every aspect of performance. This work aims to dispel this established point of view, showing that RTN is not only much cheaper to apply, but also its token generation throughput can be better than and accuracy can be similar to more advanced alternatives. In particular, we discuss our implementation of RTN based on the recent Marlin kernels and demonstrate how the accuracy of RTN can be gradually improved by selectively increasing the data precision format of certain model layers and modules. Based on our results, we argue that RTN presents a viable and practical choice for quantizing LLMs.

  Graph Transformers, leveraging the global attention to capture long-range dependencies in graph structures, have significantly advanced graph machine learning, but face prohibitive computational complexity. Tokenized Graph Learning Models (TGLMs) address this issue by converting graphs into ordered token lists for scalable processing. Besides, TGLMs also empower Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle text-attributed graphs more effectively and thus are also employed in Graph LLMs. However, existing TGLMs rely on hand-designed token lists and their adaptability to diverse graph learning scenarios remains unexplored. In this paper, we first conduct extensive empirical and theoretical preliminary studies for hand-designed token lists. Surprisingly, we identify an unexplored hop-overpriority problem: the common pre-defined token lists overemphasize nearby nodes and overwhelm the ability of TGLMs to balance local and global signals. This phenomenon is especially harmful for heterophilic graphs. To address this problem, we propose the Learnable Graph Token List (LGTL), a plug-and-play module to replace hand-designed token lists in TGLMs. Specifically, LGTL adaptively adjusts the weights across hops and prioritizes informative nodes within hops through a graph attention gate module and a selection module, respectively. In this way, contextually informative nodes can be adaptively emphasized for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Besides, we theoretically show that LGTL can address the hop-overpriority problem. Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the efficacy of LGTL across both Graph Transformers and Graph LLM backbones.

  For continuous systems modeled by dynamical equations such as ODEs and SDEs, Bellman's principle of optimality takes the form of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which provides the theoretical target of reinforcement learning (RL). Although recent advances in RL successfully leverage this formulation, the existing methods typically assume the underlying dynamics are known a priori because they need explicit access to the coefficient functions of dynamical equations to update the value function following the HJB equation. We address this inherent limitation of HJB-based RL; we propose a model-free approach still targeting the HJB equation and propose the corresponding temporal difference method. We demonstrate its potential advantages over transition kernel-based formulations, both qualitatively and empirically. The proposed formulation paves the way toward bridging stochastic optimal control and model-free reinforcement learning.

  The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices, driven by model advancements and hardware improvements, offers significant privacy benefits. However, these on-device LLMs inherently face performance limitations due to reduced model capacity and necessary compression techniques. To address this, we introduce a systematic methodology -- encompassing model capability, development efficiency, and system resources -- for evaluating on-device LLMs. Our comprehensive evaluation, encompassing models from 0.5B to 14B parameters and seven post-training quantization (PTQ) methods on commodity laptops, yields several critical insights: 1) System-level metrics exhibit near-linear scaling with effective bits-per-weight (BPW). 2) A practical threshold exists around $\sim$3.5 effective BPW, larger models subjected to low-bit quantization consistently outperform smaller models utilizing higher bit-precision. 3) Quantization with low BPW incurs marginal accuracy loss but significant memory savings. 4) Determined by low-level implementation specifics power consumption on CPU, where computation-intensive operations spend more power than memory-intensive ones. These findings offer crucial insights and practical guidelines for the efficient deployment and optimized configuration of LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices.

  Understanding and predicting urban dynamics is crucial for managing transportation systems, optimizing urban planning, and enhancing public services. While neural network-based approaches have achieved success, they often rely on task-specific architectures and large volumes of data, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse urban scenarios. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, yet their application to spatial-temporal urban dynamics remains underexplored. Existing LLM-based methods struggle to effectively integrate multifaceted spatial-temporal data and fail to address distributional shifts between training and testing data, limiting their predictive reliability in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose UrbanMind, a novel spatial-temporal LLM framework for multifaceted urban dynamics prediction that ensures both accurate forecasting and robust generalization. At its core, UrbanMind introduces Muffin-MAE, a multifaceted fusion masked autoencoder with specialized masking strategies that capture intricate spatial-temporal dependencies and intercorrelations among multifaceted urban dynamics. Additionally, we design a semantic-aware prompting and fine-tuning strategy that encodes spatial-temporal contextual details into prompts, enhancing LLMs' ability to reason over spatial-temporal patterns. To further improve generalization, we introduce a test time adaptation mechanism with a test data reconstructor, enabling UrbanMind to dynamically adjust to unseen test data by reconstructing LLM-generated embeddings. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets across multiple cities demonstrate that UrbanMind consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high accuracy and robust generalization, even in zero-shot settings.

  Despite advancements in grounded content generation, production Large Language Models (LLMs) based applications still suffer from hallucinated answers. We present "Grounded in Context" - a member of Deepchecks' ORION (Output Reasoning-based InspectiON) family of lightweight evaluation models. It is our framework for hallucination detection, designed for production-scale long-context data and tailored to diverse use cases, including summarization, data extraction, and RAG. Inspired by RAG architecture, our method integrates retrieval and Natural Language Inference (NLI) models to predict factual consistency between premises and hypotheses using an encoder-based model with only a 512-token context window. Our framework identifies unsupported claims with an F1 score of 0.83 in RAGTruth's response-level classification task, matching methods that trained on the dataset, and outperforming all comparable frameworks using similar-sized models.

  MLLM agents demonstrate potential for complex embodied tasks by retrieving multimodal task-relevant trajectory data. However, current retrieval methods primarily focus on surface-level similarities of textual or visual cues in trajectories, neglecting their effectiveness for the specific task at hand. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, MLLM As ReTriever (MART), which enhances the performance of embodied agents by utilizing interaction data to fine-tune an MLLM retriever based on preference learning, such that the retriever fully considers the effectiveness of trajectories and prioritizes them for unseen tasks. We also introduce Trajectory Abstraction, a mechanism that leverages MLLMs' summarization capabilities to represent trajectories with fewer tokens while preserving key information, enabling agents to better comprehend milestones in the trajectory. Experimental results across various environments demonstrate our method significantly improves task success rates in unseen scenes compared to baseline methods. This work presents a new paradigm for multimodal retrieval in embodied agents, by fine-tuning a general-purpose MLLM as the retriever to assess trajectory effectiveness. All the code for benchmark tasks, simulator modifications, and the MLLM retriever is available atthis https URL.

  Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance in visual question answering. However, they often suffer from hallucinations. In this work, hallucinations are categorized into two main types: initial hallucinations and snowball hallucinations. We argue that adequate contextual information can be extracted directly from the token interaction process. Inspired by causal inference in the decoding strategy, we propose to leverage causal masks to establish information propagation between multimodal tokens. The hypothesis is that insufficient interaction between those tokens may lead the model to rely on outlier tokens, overlooking dense and rich contextual cues. Therefore, we propose to intervene in the propagation process by tackling outlier tokens to enhance in-context inference. With this goal, we present FarSight, a versatile plug-and-play decoding strategy to reduce attention interference from outlier tokens merely by optimizing the causal mask. The heart of our method is effective token propagation. We design an attention register structure within the upper triangular matrix of the causal mask, dynamically allocating attention to capture attention diverted to outlier tokens. Moreover, a positional awareness encoding method with a diminishing masking rate is proposed, allowing the model to attend to further preceding tokens, especially for video sequence tasks. With extensive experiments, FarSight demonstrates significant hallucination-mitigating performance across different MLLMs on both image and video benchmarks, proving its effectiveness.

  The ImageNet hierarchy provides a structured taxonomy of object categories, offering a valuable lens through which to analyze the representations learned by deep vision models. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how vision models encode the ImageNet hierarchy, leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to probe their internal representations. SAEs have been widely used as an explanation tool for large language models (LLMs), where they enable the discovery of semantically meaningful features. Here, we extend their use to vision models to investigate whether learned representations align with the ontological structure defined by the ImageNet taxonomy. Our results show that SAEs uncover hierarchical relationships in model activations, revealing an implicit encoding of taxonomic structure. We analyze the consistency of these representations across different layers of the popular vision foundation model DINOv2 and provide insights into how deep vision models internalize hierarchical category information by increasing information in the class token through each layer. Our study establishes a framework for systematic hierarchical analysis of vision model representations and highlights the potential of SAEs as a tool for probing semantic structure in deep networks.

  While an image is worth more than a thousand words, only a few provide crucial information for a given task and thus should be focused on. In light of this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with 9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers, which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5 when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when prompts are only available during inference.

  Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced in visual tasks, yet their spatial understanding remains limited to single images, leaving them ill-suited for robotics and other real-world applications that require multi-frame reasoning. In this paper, we propose a framework to equip MLLMs with robust multi-frame spatial understanding by integrating depth perception, visual correspondence, and dynamic perception. Central to our approach is the MultiSPA dataset, a novel, large-scale collection of more than 27 million samples spanning diverse 3D and 4D scenes. Alongside MultiSPA, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark that tests a wide spectrum of spatial tasks under uniform metrics. Our resulting model, Multi-SpatialMLLM, achieves significant gains over baselines and proprietary systems, demonstrating scalable, generalizable multi-frame reasoning. We further observe multi-task benefits and early indications of emergent capabilities in challenging scenarios, and showcase how our model can serve as a multi-frame reward annotator for robotics.

  Existing medical VQA benchmarks mostly focus on single-image analysis, yet clinicians almost always compare a series of images before reaching a diagnosis. To better approximate this workflow, we introduce MedFrameQA -- the first benchmark that explicitly evaluates multi-image reasoning in medical VQA. To build MedFrameQA both at scale and in high-quality, we develop 1) an automated pipeline that extracts temporally coherent frames from medical videos and constructs VQA items whose content evolves logically across images, and 2) a multiple-stage filtering strategy, including model-based and manual review, to preserve data clarity, difficulty, and medical relevance. The resulting dataset comprises 2,851 VQA pairs (gathered from 9,237 high-quality frames in 3,420 videos), covering nine human body systems and 43 organs; every question is accompanied by two to five images. We comprehensively benchmark ten advanced Multimodal LLMs -- both proprietary and open source, with and without explicit reasoning modules -- on MedFrameQA. The evaluation challengingly reveals that all models perform poorly, with most accuracies below 50%, and accuracy fluctuates as the number of images per question increases. Error analysis further shows that models frequently ignore salient findings, mis-aggregate evidence across images, and propagate early mistakes through their reasoning chains; results also vary substantially across body systems, organs, and modalities. We hope this work can catalyze research on clinically grounded, multi-image reasoning and accelerate progress toward more capable diagnostic AI systems.

  Recent advancements in Video Question Answering (VideoQA) have introduced LLM-based agents, modular frameworks, and procedural solutions, yielding promising results. These systems use dynamic agents and memory-based mechanisms to break down complex tasks and refine answers. However, significant improvements remain in tracking objects for grounding over time and decision-making based on reasoning to better align object references with language model outputs, as newer models get better at both tasks. This work presents an LLM-brained agent for zero-shot Video Question Answering (VideoQA) that combines a Chain-of-Thought framework with grounding reasoning alongside YOLO-World to enhance object tracking and alignment. This approach establishes a new state-of-the-art in VideoQA and Video Understanding, showing enhanced performance on NExT-QA, iVQA, and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. Our framework also enables cross-checking of grounding timeframes, improving accuracy and providing valuable support for verification and increased output reliability across multiple video domains.

  High-resolution (HR) image perception remains a key challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper shifts away from prior dedicated heuristic approaches and revisits the most fundamental idea to HR perception by enhancing the long-context capability of MLLMs, driven by recent advances in long-context techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general LLMs. Towards this end, this paper presents the first study exploring the use of RAG to address HR perception challenges. Specifically, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Perception (RAP), a training-free framework that retrieves and fuses relevant image crops while preserving spatial context using the proposed Spatial-Awareness Layout. To accommodate different tasks, the proposed Retrieved-Exploration Search (RE-Search) dynamically selects the optimal number of crops based on model confidence and retrieval scores. Experimental results on HR benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of RAP, with LLaVA-v1.5-13B achieving a 43% improvement on $V^*$ Bench and 19% on HR-Bench.

  End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) demands effective processing of multi-view sensory data and robust handling of diverse and complex driving scenarios, particularly rare maneuvers such as aggressive turns. Recent success of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates that specialization of parameters enables strong scalability. In this work, we propose DriveMoE, a novel MoE-based E2E-AD framework, with a Scene-Specialized Vision MoE and a Skill-Specialized Action MoE. DriveMoE is built upon our $\pi_0$ Vision-Language-Action (VLA) baseline (originally from the embodied AI field), called Drive-$\pi_0$. Specifically, we add Vision MoE to Drive-$\pi_0$ by training a router to select relevant cameras according to the driving context dynamically. This design mirrors human driving cognition, where drivers selectively attend to crucial visual cues rather than exhaustively processing all visual information. In addition, we add Action MoE by training another router to activate specialized expert modules for different driving behaviors. Through explicit behavioral specialization, DriveMoE is able to handle diverse scenarios without suffering from modes averaging like existing models. In Bench2Drive closed-loop evaluation experiments, DriveMoE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining vision and action MoE in autonomous driving tasks. We will release our code and models of DriveMoE and Drive-$\pi_0$.

  Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central to these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image generation, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents unique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass ensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and designing sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler rule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these explorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific challenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO algorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain performance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of different reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal that GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward models possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially enhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore, we systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both their in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into efficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a new path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms to achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image generation.

To this end, we propose Share-GRPO, a novel RL approach that tackle these issues by exploring and sharing diverse reasoning trajectories over expanded question space. Specifically, Share-GRPO first expands the question space for a given question via data transformation techniques, and then encourages MLLM to effectively explore diverse reasoning trajectories over the expanded question space and shares the discovered reasoning trajectories across the expanded questions during RL. In addition, Share-GRPO also shares reward information during advantage computation, which estimates solution advantages hierarchically across and within question variants, allowing more accurate estimation of relative advantages and improving the stability of policy training. Extensive evaluations over six widely-used reasoning benchmarks showcase the superior performance of our method. Code will be available atthis https URL.

  Chain-of-thought reasoning has significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. However, this reasoning process has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its effectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel framework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual reasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable VLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby enhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks. Our 7B model, \model, achieves 84\% on V* bench, 74\% on TallyQA-Complex, and 84\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy achieved by any open-source model to date. These results highlight the importance of pixel-space reasoning and the effectiveness of our framework.

  Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in building reasoning models that articulate chains of thoughts prior to producing final answers. However, despite ongoing advances that aim at enabling reasoning for vision-language tasks, existing open-source visual reasoning models typically generate reasoning content with pure natural language, lacking explicit integration of visual information. This limits their ability to produce clearly articulated and visually grounded reasoning chains. To this end, we propose Grounded Reasoning with Images and Texts (GRIT), a novel method for training MLLMs to think with images. GRIT introduces a grounded reasoning paradigm, in which models generate reasoning chains that interleave natural language and explicit bounding box coordinates. These coordinates point to regions of the input image that the model consults during its reasoning process. Additionally, GRIT is equipped with a reinforcement learning approach, GRPO-GR, built upon the GRPO algorithm. GRPO-GR employs robust rewards focused on the final answer accuracy and format of the grounded reasoning output, which eliminates the need for data with reasoning chain annotations or explicit bounding box labels. As a result, GRIT achieves exceptional data efficiency, requiring as few as 20 image-question-answer triplets from existing datasets. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that GRIT effectively trains MLLMs to produce coherent and visually grounded reasoning chains, showing a successful unification of reasoning and grounding abilities.

  Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend the 3D physical world remains a significant challenge. Due to the lack of large-scale 3D-text pair datasets, the success of LLMs has yet to be replicated in 3D understanding. In this paper, we rethink this issue and propose a new task: 3D Data-Efficient Point-Language Understanding. The goal is to enable LLMs to achieve robust 3D object understanding with minimal 3D point cloud and text data pairs. To address this task, we introduce GreenPLM, which leverages more text data to compensate for the lack of 3D data. First, inspired by using CLIP to align images and text, we utilize a pre-trained point cloud-text encoder to map the 3D point cloud space to the text space. This mapping leaves us to seamlessly connect the text space with LLMs. Once the point-text-LLM connection is established, we further enhance text-LLM alignment by expanding the intermediate text space, thereby reducing the reliance on 3D point cloud data. Specifically, we generate 6M free-text descriptions of 3D objects, and design a three-stage training strategy to help LLMs better explore the intrinsic connections between different modalities. To achieve efficient modality alignment, we design a zero-parameter cross-attention module for token pooling. Extensive experimental results show that GreenPLM requires only 12% of the 3D training data used by existing state-of-the-art models to achieve superior 3D understanding. Remarkably, GreenPLM also achieves competitive performance using text-only data. The code and weights are available at:this https URL.

This work investigates a critical question: do existing MLLMs possess 3D spatial perception and understanding abilities? Concretely, we make the following contributions in this paper: (i) we introduce VGBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess MLLMs for visual geometry perception, e.g., camera pose and motion estimation; (ii) we propose SpatialScore, the most comprehensive and diverse multimodal spatial understanding benchmark to date, integrating VGBench with relevant data from the other 11 existing datasets. This benchmark comprises 28K samples across various spatial understanding tasks, modalities, and QA formats, along with a carefully curated challenging subset, SpatialScore-Hard; (iii) we develop SpatialAgent, a novel multi-agent system incorporating 9 specialized tools for spatial understanding, supporting both Plan-Execute and ReAct reasoning paradigms; (iv) we conduct extensive evaluations to reveal persistent challenges in spatial reasoning while demonstrating the effectiveness of SpatialAgent. We believe SpatialScore will offer valuable insights and serve as a rigorous benchmark for the next evolution of MLLMs.

  While the safety risks of image-based large language models have been extensively studied, their video-based counterparts (Video LLMs) remain critically under-examined. To systematically study this problem, we introduce \textbf{VideoSafetyBench (VSB-77k) - the first large-scale, culturally diverse benchmark for Video LLM safety}, which compromises 77,646 video-query pairs and spans 19 principal risk categories across 10 language communities. \textit{We reveal that integrating video modality degrades safety performance by an average of 42.3\%, exposing systemic risks in multimodal attack exploitation.} To address this vulnerability, we propose \textbf{VideoSafety-R1}, a dual-stage framework achieving unprecedented safety gains through two innovations: (1) Alarm Token-Guided Safety Fine-Tuning (AT-SFT) injects learnable alarm tokens into visual and textual sequences, enabling explicit harm perception across modalities via multitask objectives. (2) Then, Safety-Guided GRPO enhances defensive reasoning through dynamic policy optimization with rule-based rewards derived from dual-modality verification. These components synergize to shift safety alignment from passive harm recognition to active reasoning. The resulting framework achieves a 65.1\% improvement on VSB-Eval-HH, and improves by 59.1\%, 44.3\%, and 15.0\% on the image safety datasets MMBench, VLGuard, and FigStep, respectively. \textit{Our codes are available in the supplementary materials.} \textcolor{red}{Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and videos, and reader discretion is recommended.}

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is a widely adopted technique for encoding relative positional information in large language models (LLMs). However, when extended to large vision-language models (LVLMs), its variants introduce unintended cross-modal positional biases. Specifically, they enforce relative positional dependencies between text token indices and image tokens, causing spurious alignments. This issue arises because image tokens representing the same content but located at different spatial positions are assigned distinct positional biases, leading to inconsistent cross-modal associations. To address this, we propose Per-Token Distance (PTD) - a simple yet effective metric for quantifying the independence of positional encodings across modalities. Informed by this analysis, we introduce Circle-RoPE, a novel encoding scheme that maps image token indices onto a circular trajectory orthogonal to the linear path of text token indices, forming a cone-like structure. This configuration ensures that each text token maintains an equal distance to all image tokens, reducing artificial cross-modal biases while preserving intra-image spatial information. To further enhance performance, we propose a staggered layer strategy that applies different RoPE variants across layers. This design leverages the complementary strengths of each RoPE variant, thereby enhancing the model's overall performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively preserves spatial information from images while reducing relative positional bias, offering a more robust and flexible positional encoding framework for LVLMs. The code is available at [this https URL](this https URL).

  Recently, reasoning-based MLLMs have achieved a degree of success in generating long-form textual reasoning chains. However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on and revisiting of visual regions to achieve precise grounding of textual reasoning in visual evidence. We introduce \textbf{VLM-R$^3$} (\textbf{V}isual \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel with \textbf{R}egion \textbf{R}ecognition and \textbf{R}easoning), a framework that equips an MLLM with the ability to (i) decide \emph{when} additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine \emph{where} to ground within the image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved chain-of-thought. The core of our method is \textbf{Region-Conditioned Reinforcement Policy Optimization (R-GRPO)}, a training paradigm that rewards the model for selecting informative regions, formulating appropriate transformations (e.g.\ crop, zoom), and integrating the resulting visual context into subsequent reasoning steps. To bootstrap this policy, we compile a modest but carefully curated Visuo-Lingual Interleaved Rationale (VLIR) corpus that provides step-level supervision on region selection and textual justification. Extensive experiments on MathVista, ScienceQA, and other benchmarks show that VLM-R$^3$ sets a new state of the art in zero-shot and few-shot settings, with the largest gains appearing on questions demanding subtle spatial reasoning or fine-grained visual cue extraction.

  Generative AI (GenAI) holds significant promise for automating everyday image editing tasks, especially following the recent release of GPT-4o on March 25, 2025. However, what subjects do people most often want edited? What kinds of editing actions do they want to perform (e.g., removing or stylizing the subject)? Do people prefer precise edits with predictable outcomes or highly creative ones? By understanding the characteristics of real-world requests and the corresponding edits made by freelance photo-editing wizards, can we draw lessons for improving AI-based editors and determine which types of requests can currently be handled successfully by AI editors? In this paper, we present a unique study addressing these questions by analyzing 83k requests from the past 12 years (2013-2025) on the Reddit community, which collected 305k PSR-wizard edits. According to human ratings, approximately only 33% of requests can be fulfilled by the best AI editors (including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, SeedEdit). Interestingly, AI editors perform worse on low-creativity requests that require precise editing than on more open-ended tasks. They often struggle to preserve the identity of people and animals, and frequently make non-requested touch-ups. On the other side of the table, VLM judges (e.g., o1) perform differently from human judges and may prefer AI edits more than human edits.

  Long-video understanding has emerged as a crucial capability in real-world applications such as video surveillance, meeting summarization, educational lecture analysis, and sports broadcasting. However, it remains computationally prohibitive for VideoLLMs, primarily due to two bottlenecks: 1) sequential video decoding, the process of converting the raw bit stream to RGB frames can take up to a minute for hour-long video inputs, and 2) costly prefilling of up to several million tokens for LLM inference, resulting in high latency and memory use. To address these challenges, we propose QuickVideo, a system-algorithm co-design that substantially accelerates long-video understanding to support real-time downstream applications. It comprises three key innovations: QuickDecoder, a parallelized CPU-based video decoder that achieves 2-3 times speedup by splitting videos into keyframe-aligned intervals processed concurrently; QuickPrefill, a memory-efficient prefilling method using KV-cache pruning to support more frames with less GPU memory; and an overlapping scheme that overlaps CPU video decoding with GPU inference. Together, these components infernece time reduce by a minute on long video inputs, enabling scalable, high-quality video understanding even on limited hardware. Experiments show that QuickVideo generalizes across durations and sampling rates, making long video processing feasible in practice.

  Achieving deep alignment between vision and language remains a central challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). These models often fail to fully leverage visual input, defaulting to strong language priors. Our approach first provides insights into how MLLMs internally build visual understanding of image regions and then introduces techniques to amplify this capability. Specifically, we explore techniques designed both to deepen the model's understanding of visual content and to ensure that these visual insights actively guide language generation. We demonstrate the superior multimodal understanding of our resultant model through a detailed upstream analysis quantifying its ability to predict visually-dependent tokens as well as 10 pt boost on visually challenging tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We provide a dataset for enabling Deep Generative Models (DGMs) in engineering design and propose methods to automate data labeling by utilizing large-scale foundation models. GeoBiked is curated to contain 4 355 bicycle images, annotated with structural and technical features and is used to investigate two automated labeling techniques: The utilization of consolidated latent features (Hyperfeatures) from image-generation models to detect geometric correspondences (e.g. the position of the wheel center) in structural images and the generation of diverse text descriptions for structural images. GPT-4o, a vision-language-model (VLM), is instructed to analyze images and produce diverse descriptions aligned with the system-prompt. By representing technical images as Diffusion-Hyperfeatures, drawing geometric correspondences between them is possible. The detection accuracy of geometric points in unseen samples is improved by presenting multiple annotated source images. GPT-4o has sufficient capabilities to generate accurate descriptions of technical images. Grounding the generation only on images leads to diverse descriptions but causes hallucinations, while grounding it on categorical labels restricts the diversity. Using both as input balances creativity and accuracy. Successfully using Hyperfeatures for geometric correspondence suggests that this approach can be used for general point-detection and annotation tasks in technical images. Labeling such images with text descriptions using VLMs is possible, but dependent on the models detection capabilities, careful prompt-engineering and the selection of input information. Applying foundation models in engineering design is largely unexplored. We aim to bridge this gap with a dataset to explore training, finetuning and conditioning DGMs in this field and suggesting approaches to bootstrap foundation models to process technical images.

  The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has significantly enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and interpret diverse data modalities (e.g., image and video). However, as input complexity increases, particularly with long video sequences, the number of required tokens has grown significantly, leading to quadratically computational costs. This has made the efficient compression of video tokens in LMMs, while maintaining performance integrity, a pressing research challenge. In this paper, we introduce CrossLMM, decoupling long video sequences from LMMs via a dual cross-attention mechanism, which substantially reduces visual token quantity with minimal performance degradation. Specifically, we first implement a significant token reduction from pretrained visual encoders through a pooling methodology. Then, within LLM layers, we employ a visual-to-visual cross-attention mechanism, wherein the pooled visual tokens function as queries against the original visual token set. This module enables more efficient token utilization while retaining fine-grained informational fidelity. In addition, we introduce a text-to-visual cross-attention mechanism, for which the text tokens are enhanced through interaction with the original visual tokens, enriching the visual comprehension of the text tokens. Comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance across diverse video-based LMM benchmarks, despite utilizing substantially fewer computational resources.

  Recent advances have shown success in eliciting strong reasoning abilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome rewards. However, this paradigm typically lacks supervision over the thinking process leading to the finalthis http URLa result, the model may learn sub-optimal reasoning strategies, which can hinder its generalization ability. In light of this, we propose SophiaVL-R1, as an attempt to add reward signals for the thinking process in this paradigm. To achieve this, we first train a thinking reward model that evaluates the quality of the entire thinking process. Given that the thinking reward may be unreliable for certain samples due to reward hacking, we propose the Trust-GRPO method, which assigns a trustworthiness weight to the thinking reward during training. This weight is computed based on the thinking reward comparison of responses leading to correct answers versus incorrect answers, helping to mitigate the impact of potentially unreliable thinking rewards. Moreover, we design an annealing training strategy that gradually reduces the thinking reward over time, allowing the model to rely more on the accurate rule-based outcome reward in later training stages. Experiments show that our SophiaVL-R1 surpasses a series of reasoning MLLMs on various benchmarks (e.g., MathVisita, MMMU), demonstrating strong reasoning and generalization capabilities. Notably, our SophiaVL-R1-7B even outperforms LLaVA-OneVision-72B on most benchmarks, despite the latter having 10 times more parameters.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we propose Dimple, the first Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Large Language Model (DMLLM). We observe that training with a purely discrete diffusion approach leads to significant training instability, suboptimal performance, and severe length bias issues. To address these challenges, we design a novel training paradigm that combines an initial autoregressive phase with a subsequent diffusion phase. This approach yields the Dimple-7B model, trained on the same dataset and using a similar training pipeline as LLaVA-NEXT. Dimple-7B ultimately surpasses LLaVA-NEXT in performance by 3.9%, demonstrating that DMLLM can achieve performance comparable to that of autoregressive models. To improve inference efficiency, we propose a decoding strategy termed confident decoding, which dynamically adjusts the number of tokens generated at each step, significantly reducing the number of generation iterations. In autoregressive models, the number of forward iterations during generation equals the response length. With confident decoding, however, the number of iterations needed by Dimple is even only $\frac{\text{response length}}{3}$. We also re-implement the prefilling technique in autoregressive models and demonstrate that it does not significantly impact performance on most benchmark evaluations, while offering a speedup of 1.5x to 7x. Additionally, we explore Dimple's capability to precisely control its response using structure priors. These priors enable structured responses in a manner distinct from instruction-based or chain-of-thought prompting, and allow fine-grained control over response format and length, which is difficult to achieve in autoregressive models. Overall, this work validates the feasibility and advantages of DMLLM and enhances its inference efficiency and controllability. Code and models are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in scene-based video generation have enabled systems to synthesize coherent visual narratives from structured prompts. However, a crucial dimension of storytelling -- character-driven dialogue and speech -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a modular pipeline that transforms action-level prompts into visually and auditorily grounded narrative dialogue, enriching visual storytelling with natural voice and character expression. Our method takes as input a pair of prompts per scene, where the first defines the setting and the second specifies a character's behavior. While a story generation model such as Text2Story generates the corresponding visual scene, we focus on generating expressive character utterances from these prompts and the scene image. We apply a pretrained vision-language encoder to extract a high-level semantic feature from the representative frame, capturing salient visual context. This feature is then combined with the structured prompts and used to guide a large language model in synthesizing natural, character-consistent dialogue. To ensure contextual consistency across scenes, we introduce a Recursive Narrative Bank that conditions each dialogue generation on the accumulated dialogue history from prior scenes. This approach enables characters to speak in ways that reflect their evolving goals and interactions throughout a story. Finally, we render each utterance as expressive, character-consistent speech, resulting in fully-voiced video narratives. Our framework requires no additional training and demonstrates applicability across a variety of story settings, from fantasy adventures to slice-of-life episodes.

  The rapid advancement of native multi-modal models and omni-models, exemplified by GPT-4o, Gemini, and o3, with their capability to process and generate content across modalities such as text and images, marks a significant milestone in the evolution of intelligence. Systematic evaluation of their multi-modal output capabilities in visual thinking processes (also known as multi-modal chain of thought, M-CoT) becomes critically important. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating multi-modal models primarily focus on assessing multi-modal inputs and text-only reasoning while neglecting the importance of reasoning through multi-modal outputs. In this paper, we present a benchmark, dubbed RBench-V, designed to assess models' vision-indispensable reasoning abilities. To construct RBench-V, we carefully hand-pick 803 questions covering math, physics, counting, and games. Unlike previous benchmarks that typically specify certain input modalities, RBench-V presents problems centered on multi-modal outputs, which require image manipulation such as generating novel images and constructing auxiliary lines to support the reasoning process. We evaluate numerous open- and closed-source models on RBench-V, including o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, etc. Even the best-performing model, o3, achieves only 25.8% accuracy on RBench-V, far below the human score of 82.3%, highlighting that current models struggle to leverage multi-modal reasoning.

  Batteries are essential for various applications, including electric vehicles and renewable energy storage, making safety and efficiency critical concerns. Anomaly detection in battery thermal images helps identify failures early, but traditional deep learning methods require extensive labeled data, which is difficult to obtain, especially for anomalies due to safety risks and high data collection costs. To overcome this, we explore zero-shot anomaly detection using Visual Question Answering (VQA) models, which leverage pretrained knowledge and textbased prompts to generalize across vision tasks. By incorporating prior knowledge of normal battery thermal behavior, we design prompts to detect anomalies without battery-specific training data. We evaluate three VQA models (ChatGPT-4o, LLaVa-13b, and BLIP-2) analyzing their robustness to prompt variations, repeated trials, and qualitative outputs. Despite the lack of finetuning on battery data, our approach demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models that are trained with the battery data. Our findings highlight the potential of VQA-based zero-shot learning for battery anomaly detection and suggest future directions for improving its effectiveness.

  While humans effortlessly draw visual objects and shapes by adaptively allocating attention based on their complexity, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain constrained by rigid token representations. Bridging this gap, we propose ALTo, an adaptive length tokenizer for autoregressive mask generation. To achieve this, a novel token length predictor is designed, along with a length regularization term and a differentiable token chunking strategy. We further build ALToLLM that seamlessly integrates ALTo into MLLM. Preferences on the trade-offs between mask quality and efficiency is implemented by group relative policy optimization (GRPO).

  Recent advances in static 3D generation have intensified the demand for physically consistent dynamic 3D content. However, existing video generation models, including diffusion-based methods, often prioritize visual realism while neglecting physical plausibility, resulting in implausible object dynamics. Prior approaches for physics-aware dynamic generation typically rely on large-scale annotated datasets or extensive model fine-tuning, which imposes significant computational and data collection burdens and limits scalability across scenarios. To address these challenges, we present MAGIC, a training-free framework for single-image physical property inference and dynamic generation, integrating pretrained image-to-video diffusion models with iterative LLM-based reasoning. Our framework generates motion-rich videos from a static image and closes the visual-to-physical gap through a confidence-driven LLM feedback loop that adaptively steers the diffusion model toward physics-relevant motion. To translate visual dynamics into controllable physical behavior, we further introduce a differentiable MPM simulator operating directly on 3D Gaussians reconstructed from the single image, enabling physically grounded, simulation-ready outputs without any supervision or model tuning. Experiments show that MAGIC outperforms existing physics-aware generative methods in inference accuracy and achieves greater temporal coherence than state-of-the-art video diffusion models.

  Training large language models (LLMs) as interactive agents for controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents a unique challenge to optimize long-horizon action sequences with multimodal feedback from complex environments. While recent works have advanced multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning and tool-using capabilities in LLMs, their application to GUI-based agents remains relatively underexplored due to the difficulty of sparse rewards, delayed feedback, and high rollout costs. In this paper, we investigate end-to-end policy optimization for vision-language-based GUI agents with the aim of improving performance on complex, long-horizon computer tasks. We propose Agentic Replay Policy Optimization (ARPO), an end-to-end RL approach that augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a replay buffer to reuse the successful experience across training iterations. To further stabilize the training process, we propose a task selection strategy that filters tasks based on baseline agent performance, allowing the agent to focus on learning from informative interactions. Additionally, we compare ARPO with offline preference optimization approaches, highlighting the advantages of policy-based methods in GUI environments. Experiments on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that ARPO achieves competitive results, establishing a new performance baseline for LLM-based GUI agents trained via reinforcement learning. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of reinforcement learning for training multi-turn, vision-language GUI agents capable of managing complex real-world UI interactions.

  Computed Tomography (CT) scan, which produces 3D volumetric medical data that can be viewed as hundreds of cross-sectional images (a.k.a. slices), provides detailed anatomical information for diagnosis. For radiologists, creating CT radiology reports is time-consuming and error-prone. A visual question answering (VQA) system that can answer radiologists' questions about some anatomical regions on the CT scan and even automatically generate a radiology report is urgently needed. However, existing VQA systems cannot adequately handle the CT radiology question answering (CTQA) task for: (1) anatomic complexity makes CT images difficult to understand; (2) spatial relationship across hundreds slices is difficult to capture. To address these issues, this paper proposes CT-Agent, a multimodal agentic framework for CTQA. CT-Agent adopts anatomically independent tools to break down the anatomic complexity; furthermore, it efficiently captures the across-slice spatial relationship with a global-local token compression strategy. Experimental results on two 3D chest CT datasets, CT-RATE and RadGenome-ChestCT, verify the superior performance of CT-Agent.

  Recent advances in Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o1) have showcased impressive reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning. However, extending these capabilities to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is hampered by the prohibitive costs of retraining and the scarcity of high-quality, verifiable multimodal reasoning datasets. This paper introduces FRANK Model, a training-FRee ANd r1-liKe MLLM that imbues off-the-shelf MLLMs with reasoning and reflection abilities, without any gradient updates or extra supervision. Our key insight is to decouple perception and reasoning across MLLM decoder layers. Specifically, we observe that compared to the deeper decoder layers, the shallow decoder layers allocate more attention to visual tokens, while the deeper decoder layers concentrate on textual semantics. This observation motivates a hierarchical weight merging approach that combines a visual-pretrained MLLM with a reasoning-specialized LLM. To this end, we propose a layer-wise, Taylor-derived closed-form fusion mechanism that integrates reasoning capacity into deep decoder layers while preserving visual grounding in shallow decoder layers. Extensive experiments on challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the MMMU benchmark, our model FRANK-38B achieves an accuracy of 69.2, outperforming the strongest baseline InternVL2.5-38B by +5.3, and even surpasses the proprietary GPT-4o model.

  Visual instruction tuning aims to enable large language models to comprehend the visual world, with a pivotal challenge lying in establishing an effective vision-to-language projection. However, existing methods often grapple with the intractable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we present LLaVA-Meteor, a novel approach designed to break this deadlock, equipped with a novel Top-Down Compression paradigm that strategically compresses visual tokens without compromising core information. Specifically, we construct a trainable Flash Global Fusion module based on efficient selective state space operators, which aligns the feature space while enabling each token to perceive holistic visual context and instruction preference at low cost. Furthermore, a local-to-single scanning manner is employed to effectively capture local dependencies, thereby enhancing the model's capability in vision modeling. To alleviate computational overhead, we explore a Visual-Native Selection mechanism that independently assesses token significance by both the visual and native experts, followed by aggregation to retain the most critical subset. Extensive experiments show that our approach reduces visual tokens by 75--95% while achieving comparable or superior performance across 12 benchmarks, significantly improving efficiency.

  Recent years have seen remarkable progress in both multimodal understanding models and image generation models. Despite their respective successes, these two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally, we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and data. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid advancements and will regularly update this survey. Our goal is to inspire further research and provide a valuable reference for the community. The references associated with this survey are available on GitHub (this https URL).

  Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly improved object-level grounding and region captioning. However, they remain limited in visual relation understanding, struggling even with binary relation detection, let alone \textit{N}-ary relations involving multiple semantic roles. The core reason is the lack of modeling for \textit{structural semantic dependencies} among multi-entities, leading to unreliable outputs, hallucinations, and over-reliance on language priors (\eg, defaulting to ``person drinks a milk'' if a person is merely holding it). To this end, we propose Relation-R1, the \textit{first unified} relation comprehension framework that explicitly integrates cognitive chain-of-thought (CoT)-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and group relative policy optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. Specifically, we first establish foundational reasoning capabilities via SFT, enforcing structured outputs with thinking processes. Then, GRPO is utilized to refine these outputs via multi-rewards optimization, prioritizing visual-semantic grounding over language-induced biases, thereby improving generalization capability. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of various CoT strategies within this framework, demonstrating that a specific-to-general progressive approach in CoT guidance further improves generalization, especially in capturing synonymous \textit{N}-ary relations. Extensive experiments on widely-used PSG and SWiG datasets demonstrate that Relation-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both binary and \textit{N}-ary relation understanding.

  In recent years, rapid advances in computer vision have significantly improved the processing and generation of raster images. However, vector graphics, which is essential in digital design, due to its scalability and ease of editing, have been relatively understudied. Traditional vectorization techniques, which are often used in vector generation, suffer from long processing times and excessive output complexity, limiting their usability in practical applications. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for the generation, editing, and analysis of vector graphics, particularly in the SVG format, which is inherently text-based and well-suited for integration with LLMs.This paper provides a systematic review of existing LLM-based approaches for SVG processing, categorizing them into three main tasks: generation, editing, and understanding. We observe notable models such as IconShop, StrokeNUWA, and StarVector, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we analyze benchmark datasets designed for assessing SVG-related tasks, including SVGEditBench, VGBench, and SGP-Bench, and conduct a series of experiments to evaluate various LLMs in these domains. Our results demonstrate that for vector graphics reasoning-enhanced models outperform standard LLMs, particularly in generation and understanding tasks. Furthermore, our findings underscore the need to develop more diverse and richly annotated datasets to further improve LLM capabilities in vector graphics tasks.

  Dongba pictographic is the only pictographic script still in use in the world. Its pictorial ideographic features carry rich cultural and contextual information. However, due to the lack of relevant datasets, research on semantic understanding of Dongba hieroglyphs has progressed slowly. To this end, we constructed \textbf{DongbaMIE} - the first dataset focusing on multimodal information extraction of Dongba pictographs. The dataset consists of images of Dongba hieroglyphic characters and their corresponding semantic annotations in Chinese. It contains 23,530 sentence-level and 2,539 paragraph-level high-quality text-image pairs. The annotations cover four semantic dimensions: object, action, relation and attribute. Systematic evaluation of mainstream multimodal large language models shows that the models are difficult to perform information extraction of Dongba hieroglyphs efficiently under zero-shot and few-shot learning. Although supervised fine-tuning can improve the performance, accurate extraction of complex semantics is still a great challenge at present.

  The interpretation of multi-temporal remote sensing imagery is critical for monitoring Earth's dynamic processes-yet previous change detection methods, which produce binary or semantic masks, fall short of providing human-readable insights into changes. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have opened a new frontier by fusing visual and linguistic modalities, enabling spatio-temporal vision-language understanding: models that not only capture spatial and temporal dependencies to recognize changes but also provide a richer interactive semantic analysis of temporal images (e.g., generate descriptive captions and answer natural-language queries). In this survey, we present the first comprehensive review of RS-STVLMs. The survey covers the evolution of models from early task-specific models to recent general foundation models that leverage powerful large language models. We discuss progress in representative tasks, such as change captioning, change question answering, and change grounding. Moreover, we systematically dissect the fundamental components and key technologies underlying these models, and review the datasets and evaluation metrics that have driven the field. By synthesizing task-level insights with a deep dive into shared architectural patterns, we aim to illuminate current achievements and chart promising directions for future research in spatio-temporal vision-language understanding for remote sensing.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled intelligent tutoring systems, yet the development of LLM-based Virtual Student Agents (LVSAs) remains underexplored. Such agents are essential for teacher-facing applications, where simulating diverse learner traits can support adaptive instruction and pedagogical skill development. However, current methods lack principled personality modeling, scalable evaluation of behavioral consistency, and empirical validation in interactive teaching settings. We propose the SOEI framework, a structured pipeline comprising Scene, Object, Evaluation, and Interaction, for constructing and evaluating personality-aligned LVSAs in classroom scenarios. Leveraging Chinese language instruction as a cognitively and emotionally rich testbed, we generate five LVSAs based on Big Five traits through LoRA fine-tuning and expert-informed prompt design. Their behavioral realism and personality coherence are assessed using a hybrid human & GPT-4 evaluation and a multi-dimensional annotation protocol. Through controlled experiments with real pre-service teachers, we demonstrate that LVSAs can elicit adaptive teaching strategies and maintain trait-consistent behavior across multi-turn dialogues. Our results provide: (1) an educationally and psychologically grounded generation pipeline for LLM-based student agents; (2) a hybrid, scalable evaluation framework for behavioral realism; and (3) empirical insights into the pedagogical utility of LVSAs in shaping instructional adaptation. By embedding LVSAs into both generative modeling and human-in-the-loop teaching, SOEI bridges AI for Education (AI4Edu) and Education for AI (Edu4AI), positioning classroom interaction as a rigorous testbed for controllability, personality alignment, and human-likeness in large language models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  During the finetuning stage of text generation tasks, standard cross-entropy loss treats all tokens equally. This can lead models to overemphasize high-frequency, low-information tokens, neglecting lower-frequency tokens crucial for specificity and informativeness in generated content. This paper introduces a novel loss function, Power-Law Decay Loss (PDL), specifically designed to optimize the finetuning process for text generation. The core motivation for PDL stems from observations in information theory and linguistics: the informativeness of a token is often inversely proportional to its frequency of occurrence. PDL re-weights the contribution of each token in the standard cross-entropy loss based on its frequency in the training corpus, following a power-law decay. Specifically, the weights for high-frequency tokens are reduced, while low-frequency, information-dense tokens are assigned higher weights. This mechanism guides the model during finetuning to focus more on learning and generating tokens that convey specific and unique information, thereby enhancing the quality, diversity, and informativeness of the generated text. We theoretically elaborate on the motivation and construction of PDL and discuss its potential applications and advantages across various text generation finetuning tasks, such as abstractive summarization, dialogue systems, and style transfer.

  While reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing large language models (LLMs), it has primarily focused on single-turn tasks such as solving math problems. Training effective web agents for multi-turn interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of long-horizon decision-making across dynamic web interfaces. In this work, we present WebAgent-R1, a simple yet effective end-to-end multi-turn RL framework for training web agents. It learns directly from online interactions with web environments by asynchronously generating diverse trajectories, entirely guided by binary rewards depending on task success. Experiments on the WebArena-Lite benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of WebAgent-R1, boosting the task success rate of Qwen-2.5-3B from 6.1% to 33.9% and Llama-3.1-8B from 8.5% to 44.8%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and strong proprietary models such as OpenAI o3. In-depth analyses reveal the effectiveness of the thinking-based prompting strategy and test-time scaling through increased interactions for web tasks. We further investigate different RL initialization policies by introducing two variants, namely WebAgent-R1-Zero and WebAgent-R1-CoT, which highlight the importance of the warm-up training stage (i.e., behavior cloning) and provide insights on incorporating long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in web agents.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The attention mechanism is a core primitive in modern large language models (LLMs) and AI more broadly. Since attention by itself is permutation-invariant, position encoding is essential for modeling structured domains such as language. Rotary position encoding (RoPE) has emerged as the de facto standard approach for position encoding and is part of many modern LLMs. However, in RoPE the key/query transformation between two elements in a sequence is only a function of their relative position and otherwise independent of the actual input. This limits the expressivity of RoPE-based transformers.This paper describes PaTH, a flexible data-dependent position encoding scheme based on accumulated products of Householder(like) transformations, where each transformation is data-dependent, i.e., a function of the input. We derive an efficient parallel algorithm for training through exploiting a compact representation of products of Householder matrices, and implement a FlashAttention-style blockwise algorithm that minimizes I/O cost. Across both targeted synthetic benchmarks and moderate-scale real-world language modeling experiments, we find that PaTH demonstrates superior performance compared to RoPE and other recent baselines.

  Large language models exhibit positional bias -- systematic neglect of information at specific context positions -- yet its interplay with linguistic diversity remains poorly understood. We present a cross-linguistic study across five typologically distinct languages (English, Russian, German, Hindi, Vietnamese), examining how positional bias interacts with model uncertainty, syntax, and prompting. Key findings: (1) Positional bias is model-driven, with language-specific variations -- Qwen2.5-7B favors late positions, challenging assumptions of early-token bias; (2) Explicit positional guidance (e.g., correct context is at position X) reduces accuracy across languages, undermining prompt-engineering practices; (3) Aligning context with positional bias increases entropy, yet minimal entropy does not predict accuracy. (4) We further uncover that LLMs differently impose dominant word order in free-word-order languages like Hindi.

  Model merging has emerged as a promising technique for enhancing large language models, though its application in large-scale pre-training remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of model merging techniques during the pre-training process. Through extensive experiments with both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures ranging from millions to over 100 billion parameters, we demonstrate that merging checkpoints trained with constant learning rates not only achieves significant performance improvements but also enables accurate prediction of annealing behavior. These improvements lead to both more efficient model development and significantly lower training costs. Our detailed ablation studies on merging strategies and hyperparameters provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms while uncovering novel applications. Through comprehensive experimental analysis, we offer the open-source community practical pre-training guidelines for effective model merging.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Demonstrations and instructions are two primary approaches for prompting language models to perform in-context learning (ICL) tasks. Do identical tasks elicited in different ways result in similar representations of the task? An improved understanding of task representation mechanisms would offer interpretability insights and may aid in steering models. We study this through \textit{function vectors} (FVs), recently proposed as a mechanism to extract few-shot ICL task representations. We generalize FVs to alternative task presentations, focusing on short textual instruction prompts, and successfully extract instruction function vectors that promote zero-shot task accuracy. We find evidence that demonstration- and instruction-based function vectors leverage different model components, and offer several controls to dissociate their contributions to task performance. Our results suggest that different task promptings forms do not induce a common task representation through FVs but elicit different, partly overlapping mechanisms. Our findings offer principled support to the practice of combining instructions and task demonstrations, imply challenges in universally monitoring task inference across presentation forms, and encourage further examinations of LLM task inference mechanisms.

  This paper investigates Reinforcement Learning (RL) on data without explicit labels for reasoning tasks in Large Language Models (LLMs). The core challenge of the problem is reward estimation during inference while not having access to ground-truth information. While this setting appears elusive, we find that common practices in Test-Time Scaling (TTS), such as majority voting, yield surprisingly effective rewards suitable for driving RL training. In this work, we introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), a novel method for training LLMs using RL on unlabeled data. TTRL enables self-evolution of LLMs by utilizing the priors in the pre-trained models. Our experiments demonstrate that TTRL consistently improves performance across a variety of tasks and models. Notably, TTRL boosts the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-Math-7B by approximately 211% on the AIME 2024 with only unlabeled test data. Furthermore, although TTRL is only supervised by the maj@n metric, TTRL has demonstrated performance to consistently surpass the upper limit of the initial model maj@n, and approach the performance of models trained directly on test data with ground-truth labels. Our experimental findings validate the general effectiveness of TTRL across various tasks and highlight TTRL's potential for broader tasks and domains. GitHub:this https URL

  Scaling test-time computation, or affording a generator large language model (LLM) extra compute during inference, typically employs the help of external non-generative evaluators (i.e., reward models). Concurrently, LLM-judges, models trained to generate evaluations and critiques (explanations) in natural language, are becoming increasingly popular in automatic evaluation. Despite judge empirical successes, their effectiveness as evaluators in test-time scaling settings is largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce the Judge Evaluation for Test-Time Scaling (JETTS) benchmark, which evaluates judge performance in three domains (math reasoning, code generation, and instruction following) under three task settings: response reranking, step-level beam search, and critique-based response refinement. We evaluate 10 different judge models (7B-70B parameters) for 8 different base generator models (6.7B-72B parameters). Our benchmark shows that while judges are competitive with outcome reward models in reranking, they are consistently worse than process reward models in beam search procedures. Furthermore, though unique to LLM-judges, their natural language critiques are currently ineffective in guiding the generator towards better responses.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for factual question-answering, it becomes more important for LLMs to have the capability to communicate the likelihood that their answer is correct. For these verbalized expressions of uncertainty to be meaningful, they should reflect the error rates at the expressed level of confidence. However, when prompted to express confidence, the error rates of current LLMs are inconsistent with their communicated confidences, highlighting the need for uncertainty quantification methods. Many prior methods calculate lexical uncertainty, estimating a model's confidence in the specific string it generated. In some cases, however, it may be more useful to estimate semantic uncertainty, or the model's confidence in the answer regardless of how it is verbalized. We propose a simple procedure, uncertainty distillation, to teach an LLM to verbalize calibrated semantic confidences. Using held-out data to map initial uncertainty estimates to meaningful probabilities, we create examples annotated with verbalized probabilities for supervised fine-tuning. We compare uncertainty distillation to several strong baselines, and find that our method yields verbalized confidences that correlate well with observed error rates.

  Ensuring the safe deployment of AI systems is critical in industry settings where biased outputs can lead to significant operational, reputational, and regulatory risks. Thorough evaluation before deployment is essential to prevent these hazards. Red-teaming addresses this need by employing adversarial attacks to develop guardrails that detect and reject biased or harmful queries, enabling models to be retrained or steered away from harmful outputs. However, most red-teaming efforts focus on harmful or unethical instructions rather than addressing social bias, leaving this critical area under-explored despite its significant real-world impact, especially in customer-facing systems. We propose two bias-specific red-teaming methods, Emotional Bias Probe (EBP) and BiasKG, to evaluate how standard safety measures for harmful content affect bias. For BiasKG, we refactor natural language stereotypes into a knowledge graph. We use these attacking strategies to induce biased responses from several open- and closed-source language models. Unlike prior work, these methods specifically target social bias. We find our method increases bias in all models, even those trained with safety guardrails. Our work emphasizes uncovering societal bias in LLMs through rigorous evaluation, and recommends measures ensure AI safety in high-stakes industry deployments.

  The advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled various multimodal tasks to be addressed under a zero-shot paradigm. This paradigm sidesteps the cost of model fine-tuning, emerging as a dominant trend in practical application. Nevertheless, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), a pivotal challenge in the quest for general artificial intelligence, fails to accommodate this convenience. The zero-shot paradigm exhibits undesirable performance on MSA, casting doubt on whether MLLMs can perceive sentiments as competent as supervised models. By extending the zero-shot paradigm to In-Context Learning (ICL) and conducting an in-depth study on configuring demonstrations, we validate that MLLMs indeed possess such capability. Specifically, three key factors that cover demonstrations' retrieval, presentation, and distribution are comprehensively investigated and optimized. A sentimental predictive bias inherent in MLLMs is also discovered and later effectively counteracted. By complementing each other, the devised strategies for three factors result in average accuracy improvements of 15.9% on six MSA datasets against the zero-shot paradigm and 11.2% against the random ICL baseline.

  The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has profoundly impacted the document domain, creating a wide array of application scenarios. This progress highlights the need for a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate these models' capabilities across various document-specific tasks. However, existing benchmarks often fail to locate specific model weaknesses or guide systematic improvements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a General Document Intelligence Benchmark (GDI-Bench), featuring 2.3k images across 9 key scenarios and 19 document-specific tasks. By decoupling visual complexity and reasoning complexity, the GDI-Bench structures graded tasks that allow performance assessment by difficulty, aiding in model weakness identification and optimization guidance. We evaluate various open-source and closed-source models on GDI-Bench, conducting decoupled analyses in the visual and reasoning domains, revealing their strengths and weaknesses. To address the diverse tasks and domains in the GDI-Bench, we propose a GDI-Model that mitigates catastrophic forgetting during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process through an intelligence-preserving training strategy, thereby reinforcing the inherent weaknesses of the base model. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on previous benchmarks and the GDI-Bench. Both our benchmark and models are or will be open-sourced onthis https URL.

  LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing single LLMs to address complex and diverse tasks in practical applications. Despite considerable advancements, the field lacks a unified codebase that consolidates existing methods, resulting in redundant re-implementation efforts, unfair comparisons, and high entry barriers for researchers. To address these challenges, we introduce MASLab, a unified, comprehensive, and research-friendly codebase for LLM-based MAS. (1) MASLab integrates over 20 established methods across multiple domains, each rigorously validated by comparing step-by-step outputs with its official implementation. (2) MASLab provides a unified environment with various benchmarks for fair comparisons among methods, ensuring consistent inputs and standardized evaluation protocols. (3) MASLab implements methods within a shared streamlined structure, lowering the barriers for understanding and extension. Building on MASLab, we conduct extensive experiments covering 10+ benchmarks and 8 models, offering researchers a clear and comprehensive view of the current landscape of MAS methods. MASLab will continue to evolve, tracking the latest developments in the field, and invite contributions from the broader open-source community.

  Large language models (LLMs) based agent systems have made great strides in real-world applications beyond traditional NLP tasks. This paper proposes a new LLM-powered Multi-Agent System (LLM-MAS) benchmark, Collab-Overcooked, built on the popular Overcooked-AI game with more applicable and challenging tasks in interactive environments. Collab-Overcooked extends existing benchmarks from two novel perspectives. First, it provides a multi-agent framework supporting diverse tasks and objectives and encourages collaboration through natural language communication. Second, it introduces a spectrum of process-oriented evaluation metrics to assess the fine-grained collaboration capabilities of different LLM agents, a dimension often overlooked in prior work. We conduct extensive experiments over 11 popular LLMs and show that, while the LLMs present a strong ability in goal interpretation, there is a significant discrepancy in active collaboration and continuous adaptation which are critical for efficiently fulfilling complicated tasks. Notably, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-MAS and provide insights for improving and evaluating LLM-MAS on a unified and open-sourced benchmark. The environments, 30 open-ended tasks, and the evaluation package are publicly available atthis https URL.

  As large language models gain popularity, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a primary concern. While fine-tuning models on domain-specific datasets is often employed to improve model performance, it can introduce vulnerabilities within the underlying model. In this work, we investigate Accidental Misalignment, unexpected vulnerabilities arising from characteristics of fine-tuning data. We begin by identifying potential correlation factors such as linguistic features, semantic similarity, and toxicity within our experimental datasets. We then evaluate the adversarial performance of these fine-tuned models and assess how dataset factors correlate with attack success rates. Lastly, we explore potential causal links, offering new insights into adversarial defense strategies and highlighting the crucial role of dataset design in preserving model alignment.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant computational and memory challenges due to their extensive size, making pruning essential for their efficient deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods often apply uniform sparsity constraints across layers or within each layer, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at high sparsity ratios. This work introduces TRIM (Targeted Row-wise Iterative Metric-driven pruning), a novel approach that applies varying sparsity ratios to individual output dimensions (rows) within each layer. TRIM employs an iterative adjustment process guided by quality metrics to optimize dimension-wise sparsity allocation, focusing on reducing variance in quality retention across outputs to preserve critical information. TRIM can be seamlessly integrated with existing layer-wise pruning strategies. Our evaluations on perplexity and zero-shot tasks across diverse LLM families (Qwen2.5, LLaMA-2, and OPT) and sparsity levels demonstrate that TRIM achieves new state-of-the-art results and enhances stability. For instance, at 80% sparsity, TRIM reduces perplexity by 48% for Qwen2.5-14B and over 90% for OPT-13B compared to baseline methods. We conclude that fine-grained, dimension-wise sparsity adaptation is crucial for pushing the limits of extreme LLM compression. Code available at:this https URL

  Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in machine translation (MT). However, most advanced MT-specific LLMs heavily rely on external supervision signals during training, such as human-annotated reference data or trained reward models (RMs), which are often expensive to obtain and challenging to scale. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for MT that is reference-free, fully online, and relies solely on self-judging rewards. Training with SSR using 13K monolingual examples and Qwen-2.5-7B as the backbone, our model SSR-Zero-7B outperforms existing MT-specific LLMs, e.g., TowerInstruct-13B and GemmaX-28-9B, as well as larger general LLMs like Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation tasks from WMT23, WMT24, and Flores200 benchmarks. Furthermore, by augmenting SSR with external supervision from COMET, our strongest model, SSR-X-Zero-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation, surpassing all existing open-source models under 72B parameters and even outperforming closed-source models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of the self-rewarding mechanism compared to the external LLM-as-a-judge approach in MT and demonstrates its complementary benefits when combined with trained RMs. Our findings provide valuable insight into the potential of self-improving RL methods. We have publicly released our code, data and models.

  High-quality machine translation systems based on large language models (LLMs) have simplified the production of personalized translations reflecting specific stylistic constraints. However, these systems still struggle in settings where stylistic requirements are less explicit and might be harder to convey via prompting. We explore various strategies for personalizing LLM-generated translations in low-resource settings, focusing on the challenging literary translation domain. We explore prompting strategies and inference-time interventions for steering model generations towards a personalized style, and propose a contrastive framework exploiting latent concepts extracted from sparse autoencoders to identify salient personalization properties. Our results show that steering achieves strong personalization while preserving translation quality. We further examine the impact of steering on LLM representations, finding model layers with a relevant impact for personalization are impacted similarly by multi-shot prompting and our steering method, suggesting similar mechanism at play.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs) combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context (ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context sentences without additional fine-tuning or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG models.

  Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL). However, leveraging the RL algorithm to empower effective multi-tool collaborative reasoning in LLMs remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Tool-Star, an RL-based framework designed to empower LLMs to autonomously invoke multiple external tools during stepwise reasoning. Tool-Star integrates six types of tools and incorporates systematic designs in both data synthesis and training. To address the scarcity of tool-use data, we propose a general tool-integrated reasoning data synthesis pipeline, which combines tool-integrated prompting with hint-based sampling to automatically and scalably generate tool-use trajectories. A subsequent quality normalization and difficulty-aware classification process filters out low-quality samples and organizes the dataset from easy to hard. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework to enhance multi-tool collaborative reasoning by: (1) cold-start fine-tuning, which guides LLMs to explore reasoning patterns via tool-invocation feedback; and (2) a multi-tool self-critic RL algorithm with hierarchical reward design, which reinforces reward understanding and promotes effective tool collaboration. Experimental analyses on over 10 challenging reasoning benchmarks highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of Tool-Star. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Prompt optimization offers a practical and broadly applicable alternative to fine-tuning for improving large language model (LLM) performance. However, existing methods often rely on costly output generation, self-critiquing abilities, or human-annotated preferences, which limit their scalability, especially for smaller or non-instruction-tuned models. We introduce PMPO (Probabilistic Metric Prompt Optimization), a unified framework that refines prompts using token-level cross-entropy loss as a direct, lightweight evaluation signal. PMPO identifies low-quality prompt segments by masking and measuring their impact on loss, then rewrites and selects improved variants by minimizing loss over positive and negative examples. Unlike prior methods, it requires no output sampling or human evaluation during optimization, relying only on forward passes and log-likelihoods. PMPO supports both supervised and preference-based tasks through a closely aligned loss-based evaluation strategy. Experiments show that PMPO consistently outperforms prior methods across model sizes and tasks: it achieves the highest average accuracy on BBH, performs strongly on GSM8K and AQUA-RAT, and improves AlpacaEval 2.0 win rates by over 19 points. These results highlight PMPO's effectiveness, efficiency, and broad applicability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models are typically adapted to downstream tasks through supervised fine-tuning on domain-specific data. While standard fine-tuning focuses on minimizing generation loss to optimize model parameters, we take a deeper step by retaining and leveraging the model's own learning signals, analogous to how human learners reflect on past mistakes to improve future performance. We first introduce the concept of Mistake Log to systematically track the model's learning behavior and recurring errors throughout fine-tuning. Treating the original transformer-based model as the Pilot, we correspondingly design a Copilot model to refine the Pilot's inference performance via logits rectification. We name the overall Pilot-Copilot framework the Transformer Copilot, which introduces (i) a novel Copilot model design, (ii) a joint training paradigm where the Copilot continuously learns from the evolving Mistake Log alongside the Pilot, and (iii) a fused inference paradigm where the Copilot rectifies the Pilot's logits for enhanced generation. We provide both theoretical and empirical analyses on our new learning framework. Experiments on 12 benchmarks spanning commonsense, arithmetic, and recommendation tasks demonstrate that Transformer Copilot consistently improves performance by up to 34.5%, while introducing marginal computational overhead to Pilot models and exhibiting strong scalability and transferability.

  Personalizing jargon detection and explanation is essential for making technical documents accessible to readers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. However, tailoring models to individual users typically requires substantial annotation efforts and computational resources due to user-specific finetuning. To address this, we present a systematic study of personalized jargon detection, focusing on methods that are both efficient and scalable for real-world deployment. We explore two personalization strategies: (1) lightweight fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on open-source models, and (2) personalized prompting, which tailors model behavior at inference time without retaining. To reflect realistic constraints, we also investigate hybrid approaches that combine limited annotated data with unsupervised user background signals. Our personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 by 21.4% in F1 score and exceeds the best performing oracle baseline by 8.3%. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only 10% of the annotated training data, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained settings. Our study offers the first work to systematically explore efficient, low-resource personalization of jargon detection using open-source language models, offering a practical path toward scalable, user-adaptive NLP system.

  Recent advances such as DeepSeek R1-Zero highlight the effectiveness of incentive training, a reinforcement learning paradigm that computes rewards solely based on the final answer part of a language model's output, thereby encouraging the generation of intermediate reasoning steps. However, these methods fundamentally rely on external verifiers, which limits their applicability to domains like mathematics and coding where such verifiers are readily available. Although reward models can serve as verifiers, they require high-quality annotated data and are costly to train. In this work, we propose NOVER, NO-VERifier Reinforcement Learning, a general reinforcement learning framework that requires only standard supervised fine-tuning data with no need for an external verifier. NOVER enables incentive training across a wide range of text-to-text tasks and outperforms the model of the same size distilled from large reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 671B by 7.7 percent. Moreover, the flexibility of NOVER enables new possibilities for optimizing large language models, such as inverse incentive training.

  Neural language models are black-boxes -- both linguistic patterns and factual knowledge are distributed across billions of opaque parameters. This entangled encoding makes it difficult to reliably inspect, verify, or update specific facts. We propose a new class of language models, Large Memory Language Models (LMLM) with a pre-training recipe that stores factual knowledge in both internal weights and an external database. Our approach strategically masks externally retrieved factual values from the training loss, thereby teaching the model to perform targeted lookups rather than relying on memorization in model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that LMLMs achieve competitive performance compared to significantly larger, knowledge-dense LLMs on standard benchmarks, while offering the advantages of explicit, editable, and verifiable knowledge bases. This work represents a fundamental shift in how language models interact with and manage factual knowledge.

  Effective social intelligence simulation requires language agents to dynamically adjust reasoning depth, a capability notably absent in current studies. Existing methods either lack this kind of reasoning capability or enforce Long Chain-of-Thought reasoning uniformly across all scenarios, resulting in excessive token usage and inflexible social simulation. To address this, we propose an $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{AML}$) framework in this paper, aiming to improve the adaptive thinking ability of language agents in dynamic social interactions. To this end, we first identify hierarchical thinking modes ranging from intuitive response to deep deliberation based on the cognitive control theory. We then develop the $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{AMPO}$) algorithm to optimize the context-aware mode switching and reasoning. Our framework advances existing research in three key aspects: (1) Multi-granular thinking mode design, (2) Context-aware mode switching across social interaction, and (3) Token-efficient reasoning via depth-adaptive processing. Extensive experiments on social intelligence benchmarks verify that AML achieves 15.6% higher task performance than GPT-4o. Notably, our AMPO outperforms GRPO by 7.0% with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains, demonstrating the advantage of adaptive thinking mode selection and optimization mechanism in AMPO over GRPO's fixed-depth solution.

  An ideal detection system for machine generated content is supposed to work well on any generator as many more advanced LLMs come into existence day by day. Existing systems often struggle with accurately identifying AI-generated content over shorter texts. Further, not all texts might be entirely authored by a human or LLM, hence we focused more over partial cases i.e human-LLM co-authored texts. Our paper introduces a set of models built for the task of token classification which are trained on an extensive collection of human-machine co-authored texts, which performed well over texts of unseen domains, unseen generators, texts by non-native speakers and those with adversarial inputs. We also introduce a new dataset of over 2.4M such texts mostly co-authored by several popular proprietary LLMs over 23 languages. We also present findings of our models' performance over each texts of each domain and generator. Additional findings include comparison of performance against each adversarial method, length of input texts and characteristics of generated texts compared to the original human authored texts.

  Transformers have become the de facto architecture for a wide range of machine learning tasks, particularly in large language models (LLMs). Despite their remarkable performance, challenges remain in training deep transformer networks, especially regarding the position of layer normalization. While Pre-Norm structures facilitate more stable training owing to their stronger identity path, they often lead to suboptimal performance compared to Post-Norm. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{HybridNorm}$, a simple yet effective hybrid normalization strategy that integrates the advantages of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm. Specifically, HybridNorm employs QKV normalization within the attention mechanism and Post-Norm in the feed-forward network (FFN) of each transformer block. We provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence demonstrating that HybridNorm improves gradient flow and model robustness. Extensive experiments on large-scale transformer models, including both dense and sparse variants, show that HybridNorm consistently outperforms both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches across multiple benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of HybridNorm as a more stable and effective technique for improving the training and performance of deep transformer models.

  We introduce SelfCite, a novel self-supervised approach that aligns LLMs to generate high-quality, fine-grained, sentence-level citations for the statements in their generated responses. Instead of only relying on costly and labor-intensive annotations, SelfCite leverages a reward signal provided by the LLM itself through context ablation: If a citation is necessary, removing the cited text from the context should prevent the same response; if sufficient, retaining the cited text alone should preserve the same response. This reward can guide the inference-time best-of-N sampling strategy to improve citation quality significantly, as well as be used in preference optimization to directly fine-tune the models for generating better citations. The effectiveness of SelfCite is demonstrated by increasing citation F1 up to 5.3 points on the LongBench-Cite benchmark across five long-form question answering tasks.

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face a fundamental challenge in aligning independently developed retrievers and large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically involve modifying either component or introducing simple intermediate modules, resulting in practical limitations and sub-optimal performance. Inspired by human search behavior -- typically involving a back-and-forth process of proposing search queries and reviewing documents, we propose C-3PO, a proxy-centric framework that facilitates communication between retrievers and LLMs through a lightweight multi-agent system. Our framework implements three specialized agents that collaboratively optimize the entire RAG pipeline without altering the retriever and LLMs. These agents work together to assess the need for retrieval, generate effective queries, and select information suitable for the LLMs. To enable effective multi-agent coordination, we develop a tree-structured rollout approach for reward credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments in both in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios demonstrate that C-3PO significantly enhances RAG performance while maintaining plug-and-play flexibility and superior generalization capabilities.

  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using diverse datasets is crucial for enhancing their overall performance across various domains. In practical scenarios, existing methods based on modeling the mixture proportions of data composition often struggle with data whose domain labels are missing, imprecise or non-normalized, while methods based on data selection usually encounter difficulties in balancing multi-domain performance. To address these challenges, in this work, we investigate the role of data diversity in enhancing the overall abilities of LLMs by empirically constructing contrastive data pools and theoretically deriving explanations. Building upon the insights gained, we propose a new method that gives the LLM a dual identity: an output model to cognitively probe and select data based on diversity reward, as well as an input model to be tuned with the selected data. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method notably boosts performance across domain-undetermined data and a series of foundational downstream tasks when applied to various advanced LLMs. We release our code and hope this study can shed light on the understanding of data diversity and advance feedback-driven data-model co-design for LLMs.

  The growth in prominence of large language models (LLMs) in everyday life can be largely attributed to their generative abilities, yet some of this is also owed to the risks and costs associated with their use. On one front is their tendency to hallucinate false or misleading information, limiting their reliability. On another is the increasing focus on the computational limitations associated with traditional self-attention based LLMs, which has brought about new alternatives, in particular recurrent models, meant to overcome them. Yet it remains uncommon to consider these two concerns simultaneously. Do changes in architecture exacerbate/alleviate existing concerns about hallucinations? Do they affect how and where they occur? Through an extensive evaluation, we study how these architecture-based inductive biases affect the propensity to hallucinate. While hallucination remains a general phenomenon not limited to specific architectures, the situations in which they occur and the ease with which specific types of hallucinations can be induced can significantly differ based on the model architecture. These findings highlight the need for better understanding both these problems in conjunction with each other, as well as consider how to design more universal techniques for handling hallucinations.

  When adapting ICL with or without fine-tuning, we are curious about whether the instruction-tuned language model is able to achieve well-calibrated results without suffering from the problem of overconfidence (i.e., miscalibration) considering its strong instruction following ability, especially in such limited data setups. In this work, we deliver an in-depth analysis of the behavior across different choices of learning methods from the perspective of both performance and calibration. Through extensive controlled experiments, we observe that the miscalibration problem exists across all learning methods in low-resource setups. To achieve simultaneous gain for both in-task performance and calibration, we then study the potential of self-ensembling applied at different modeling stages (e.g., variations of in-context examples or variations in prompts or different ensembling strategies) to make the predictions more calibrated and have comparable or even better performance. We find that self-ensembling with max probability produces robust and calibrated predictions. Our work reveals the potential calibration problem of using ICL despite the improvements in task performance and sheds light on which learning paradigm to choose. We also provide practical guidelines for choosing learning paradigms depending on whether the data has been seen by the model before and a worthwhile solution via self-ensembling on how to enhance both task performance and calibration of LMs, which we hope could encourage further study.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to achieve breakthrough performance on complex logical reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, most existing research focuses on employing formal language to guide LLMs to derive reliable reasoning paths, while systematic evaluations of these capabilities are still limited. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs across various logical reasoning problems utilizing formal languages. From the perspective of three dimensions, i.e., spectrum of LLMs, taxonomy of tasks, and format of trajectories, our key findings are: 1) Thinking models significantly outperform Instruct models, especially when formal language is employed; 2) All LLMs exhibit limitations in inductive reasoning capability, irrespective of whether they use a formal language; 3) Data with PoT format achieves the best generalization performance across other languages. Additionally, we also curate the formal-relative training data to further enhance the small language models, and the experimental results indicate that a simple rejected fine-tuning method can better enable LLMs to generalize across formal languages and achieve the best overall performance.

To address this, we introduce T1, a tool-augmented, multi-domain, multi-turn conversational dataset specifically designed to capture and manage inter-tool dependencies across diverse domains. T1 enables rigorous evaluation of agents' ability to coordinate tool use across nine distinct domains (4 single domain and 5 multi-domain) with the help of an integrated caching mechanism for both short- and long-term memory, while supporting dynamic replanning-such as deciding whether to recompute or reuse cached results. Beyond facilitating research on tool use and planning, T1 also serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of open-source language models. We present results powered by T1-Agent, highlighting their ability to plan and reason in complex, tool-dependent scenarios.

  Efficiently managing compute resources for Large Language Model (LLM) inference remains challenging due to the inherently stochastic and variable lengths of autoregressive text generation. Accurately estimating response lengths in advance enables proactive resource allocation, yet existing approaches either bias text generation towards certain lengths or rely on assumptions that ignore model- and prompt-specific variability. We introduce CASTILLO, a dataset characterizing response length distributions across 13 widely-used open-source LLMs evaluated on seven distinct instruction-following corpora. For each $\langle$prompt, model$\rangle$ sample pair, we generate 10 independent completions using fixed decoding hyper-parameters, record the token length of each response, and publish summary statistics (mean, std-dev, percentiles), along with the shortest and longest completions, and the exact generation settings. Our analysis reveals significant inter- and intra-model variability in response lengths (even under identical generation settings), as well as model-specific behaviors and occurrences of partial text degeneration in only subsets of responses. CASTILLO enables the development of predictive models for proactive scheduling and provides a systematic framework for analyzing model-specific generation behaviors. We publicly release the dataset and code to foster research at the intersection of generative language modeling and systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based language models exhibit In-Context Learning (ICL), where predictions are made adaptively based on context. While prior work links induction heads to ICL through a sudden jump in accuracy, this can only account for ICL when the answer is included within the context. However, an important property of practical ICL in large language models is the ability to meta-learn how to solve tasks from context, rather than just copying answers from context; how such an ability is obtained during training is largely unexplored. In this paper, we experimentally clarify how such meta-learning ability is acquired by analyzing the dynamics of the model's circuit during training. Specifically, we extend the copy task from previous research into an In-Context Meta Learning setting, where models must infer a task from examples to answer queries. Interestingly, in this setting, we find that there are multiple phases in the process of acquiring such abilities, and that a unique circuit emerges in each phase, contrasting with the single-phases change in induction heads. The emergence of such circuits can be related to several phenomena known in large language models, and our analysis lead to a deeper understanding of the source of the transformer's ICL ability.

  Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advancements, are fundamentally limited by their static parametric knowledge, hindering performance on tasks requiring open-domain up-to-date information. While enabling LLMs to interact with external knowledge environments is a promising solution, current efforts primarily address closed-end problems. Open-ended questions, which characterized by lacking a standard answer or providing non-unique and diverse answers, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present O$^2$-Searcher, a novel search agent leveraging reinforcement learning to effectively tackle both open-ended and closed-ended questions in the open domain. O$^2$-Searcher leverages an efficient, locally simulated search environment for dynamic knowledge acquisition, effectively decoupling the external world knowledge from model's sophisticated reasoning processes. It employs a unified training mechanism with meticulously designed reward functions, enabling the agent to identify problem types and adapt different answer generation strategies. Furthermore, to evaluate performance on complex open-ended tasks, we construct O$^2$-QA, a high-quality benchmark featuring 300 manually curated, multi-domain open-ended questions with associated web page caches. Extensive experiments show that O$^2$-Searcher, using only a 3B model, significantly surpasses leading LLM agents on O$^2$-QA. It also achieves SOTA results on various closed-ended QA benchmarks against similarly-sized models, while performing on par with much larger ones.

  Despite significant progress, recent studies have indicated that current large language models (LLMs) may still utilize bias during inference, leading to the poor generalizability of LLMs. Some benchmarks are proposed to investigate the generalizability of LLMs, with each piece of data typically containing one type of controlled bias. However, a single piece of data may contain multiple types of biases in practical applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-bias benchmark where each piece of data contains five types of biases. The evaluations conducted on this benchmark reveal that the performance of existing LLMs and debiasing methods is unsatisfying, highlighting the challenge of eliminating multiple types of biases simultaneously. To overcome this challenge, we propose a causal effect estimation-guided multi-bias elimination method (CMBE). This method first estimates the causal effect of multiple types of biases simultaneously. Subsequently, we eliminate the causal effect of biases from the total causal effect exerted by both the semantic information and biases during inference. Experimental results show that CMBE can effectively eliminate multiple types of bias simultaneously to enhance the generalizability of LLMs.

  Factual hallucinations are a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). They undermine reliability and user trust by generating inaccurate or fabricated content. Recent studies suggest that when generating false statements, the internal states of LLMs encode information about truthfulness. However, these studies often rely on synthetic datasets that lack realism, which limits generalization when evaluating the factual accuracy of text generated by the model itself. In this paper, we challenge the findings of previous work by investigating truthfulness encoding capabilities, leading to the generation of a more realistic and challenging dataset. Specifically, we extend previous work by introducing: (1) a strategy for sampling plausible true-false factoid sentences from tabular data and (2) a procedure for generating realistic, LLM-dependent true-false datasets from Question Answering collections. Our analysis of two open-source LLMs reveals that while the findings from previous studies are partially validated, generalization to LLM-generated datasets remains challenging. This study lays the groundwork for future research on factuality in LLMs and offers practical guidelines for more effective evaluation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become central to NLP, demonstrating their ability to adapt to various tasks through prompting techniques, including sentiment analysis. However, we still have a limited understanding of how these models capture sentiment-related information. This study probes the hidden layers of Llama models to pinpoint where sentiment features are most represented and to assess how this affects sentiment analysis.Using probe classifiers, we analyze sentiment encoding across layers and scales, identifying the layers and pooling methods that best capture sentiment signals. Our results show that sentiment information is most concentrated in mid-layers for binary polarity tasks, with detection accuracy increasing up to 14% over prompting techniques. Additionally, we find that in decoder-only models, the last token is not consistently the most informative for sentiment encoding. Finally, this approach enables sentiment tasks to be performed with memory requirements reduced by an average of 57%.These insights contribute to a broader understanding of sentiment in LLMs, suggesting layer-specific probing as an effective approach for sentiment tasks beyond prompting, with potential to enhance model utility and reduce memory requirements.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Teaching large language models (LLMs) to be faithful in the provided context is crucial for building reliable information-seeking systems. Therefore, we propose a systematic framework, CANOE, to improve the faithfulness of LLMs in both short-form and long-form generation tasks without human annotations. Specifically, we first synthesize short-form question-answering (QA) data with four diverse tasks to construct high-quality and easily verifiable training data without human annotation. Also, we propose Dual-GRPO, a rule-based reinforcement learning method that includes three tailored rule-based rewards derived from synthesized short-form QA data, while simultaneously optimizing both short-form and long-form response generation. Notably, Dual-GRPO eliminates the need to manually label preference data to train reward models and avoids over-optimizing short-form generation when relying only on the synthesized short-form QA data. Experimental results show that CANOE greatly improves the faithfulness of LLMs across 11 different downstream tasks, even outperforming the most advanced LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o and OpenAI o1.

  Evaluating and iterating upon recommender systems is crucial, yet traditional A/B testing is resource-intensive, and offline methods struggle with dynamic user-platform interactions. While agent-based simulation is promising, existing platforms often lack a mechanism for user actions to dynamically reshape the environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce RecInter, a novel agent-based simulation platform for recommender systems featuring a robust interaction mechanism. In RecInter platform, simulated user actions (e.g., likes, reviews, purchases) dynamically update item attributes in real-time, and introduced Merchant Agents can reply, fostering a more realistic and evolving ecosystem. High-fidelity simulation is ensured through Multidimensional User Profiling module, Advanced Agent Architecture, and LLM fine-tuned on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enriched interaction data. Our platform achieves significantly improved simulation credibility and successfully replicates emergent phenomena like Brand Loyalty and the Matthew Effect. Experiments demonstrate that this interaction mechanism is pivotal for simulating realistic system evolution, establishing our platform as a credible testbed for recommender systems research.

  _Benjamin Vendeville, Liana Ermakova, Pierre De Loor_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The general public often encounters complex texts but does not have the time or expertise to fully understand them, leading to the spread of misinformation. Automatic Text Simplification (ATS) helps make information more accessible, but its evaluation methods have not kept up with advances in text generation, especially with Large Language Models (LLMs). In particular, recent studies have shown that current ATS metrics do not correlate with the presence of errors. Manual inspections have further revealed a variety of errors, underscoring the need for a more nuanced evaluation framework, which is currently lacking. This resource paper addresses this gap by introducing a test collection for detecting and classifying errors in simplified texts. First, we propose a taxonomy of errors, with a formal focus on information distortion. Next, we introduce a parallel dataset of automatically simplified scientific texts. This dataset has been human-annotated with labels based on our proposed taxonomy. Finally, we analyze the quality of the dataset, and we study the performance of existing models to detect and classify errors from that taxonomy. These contributions give researchers the tools to better evaluate errors in ATS, develop more reliable models, and ultimately improve the quality of automatically simplified texts.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models (LLMs) can solve PhD-level reasoning problems over long context inputs, they still struggle with a seemingly simpler task: following explicit length instructions-e.g., write a 10,000-word novel. Additionally, models often generate far too short outputs, terminate prematurely, or even refuse the request. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on evaluating generations quality, but often overlook whether the generations meet length constraints. To this end, we introduce Length Instruction Following Evaluation Benchmark (LIFEBench) to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' ability to follow length instructions across diverse tasks and a wide range of specified lengths. LIFEBench consists of 10,800 instances across 4 task categories in both English and Chinese, covering length constraints ranging from 16 to 8192 words. We evaluate 26 widely-used LLMs and find that most models reasonably follow short-length instructions but deteriorate sharply beyond a certain threshold. Surprisingly, almost all models fail to reach the vendor-claimed maximum output lengths in practice, as further confirmed by our evaluations extending up to 32K words. Even long-context LLMs, despite their extended input-output windows, counterintuitively fail to improve length-instructions following. Notably, Reasoning LLMs outperform even specialized long-text generation models, achieving state-of-the-art length following. Overall, LIFEBench uncovers fundamental limitations in current LLMs' length instructions following ability, offering critical insights for future progress.

  Understanding health information is essential in achieving and maintaining a healthy life. We focus on simplifying health information for better understanding. With the availability of generative AI, the simplification process has become efficient and of reasonable quality, however, the algorithms remove information that may be crucial for comprehension. In this study, we compare generative AI to detect missing information in simplified text, evaluate its importance, and fix the text with the missing information. We collected 50 health information texts and simplified them using gpt-4-0613. We compare five approaches to identify missing elements and regenerate the text by inserting the missing elements. These five approaches involve adding missing entities and missing words in various ways: 1) adding all the missing entities, 2) adding all missing words, 3) adding the top-3 entities ranked by gpt-4-0613, and 4, 5) serving as controls for comparison, adding randomly chosen entities. We use cosine similarity and ROUGE scores to evaluate the semantic similarity and content overlap between the original, simplified, and reconstructed simplified text. We do this for both summaries and full text. Overall, we find that adding missing entities improves the text. Adding all the missing entities resulted in better text regeneration, which was better than adding the top-ranked entities or words, or random words. Current tools can identify these entities, but are not valuable in ranking them.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern BPE tokenizers often split calendar dates into meaningless fragments, e.g., 20250312 $\rightarrow$ 202, 503, 12, inflating token counts and obscuring the inherent structure needed for robust temporal reasoning. In this work, we (1) introduce a simple yet interpretable metric, termed date fragmentation ratio, that measures how faithfully a tokenizer preserves multi-digit date components; (2) release DateAugBench, a suite of 6500 examples spanning three temporal reasoning tasks: context-based date resolution, format-invariance puzzles, and date arithmetic across historical, contemporary, and future regimes; and (3) through layer-wise probing and causal attention-hop analyses, uncover an emergent date-abstraction mechanism whereby large language models stitch together the fragments of month, day, and year components for temporal reasoning. Our experiments show that excessive fragmentation correlates with accuracy drops of up to 10 points on uncommon dates like historical and futuristic dates. Further, we find that the larger the model, the faster the emergent date abstraction that heals date fragments is accomplished. Lastly, we observe a reasoning path that LLMs follow to assemble date fragments, typically differing from human interpretation (year $\rightarrow$ month $\rightarrow$ day).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm offers a scalable, reference-free approach for evaluating language models. Although several calibration techniques have been proposed to better align these evaluators with human judgment, prior studies focus primarily on narrow, well-structured benchmarks. As a result, it remains unclear whether such calibrations generalize to real-world, open-ended tasks.In this work, we show that SOTA calibrated evaluators often fail in these settings, exhibiting weak or even negative correlation with human judgments. To address this, we propose SLMEval, a novel and efficient calibration method based on entropy maximization over a small amount of human preference data. By estimating a latent distribution over model quality and reweighting evaluator scores accordingly, SLMEval achieves strong correlation with human evaluations across two real-world production use cases and the public benchmark. For example, on one such task, SLMEval achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.57 with human judgments, while G-Eval yields a negative correlation. In addition, SLMEval reduces evaluation costs by 5-30x compared to GPT-4-based calibrated evaluators such as G-eval.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful sources of evidence for linguists seeking to develop theories of syntax. In this paper, we argue that causal interpretability methods, applied to LLMs, can greatly enhance the value of such evidence by helping us characterize the abstract mechanisms that LLMs learn to use. Our empirical focus is a set of English filler-gap dependency constructions (e.g., questions, relative clauses). Linguistic theories largely agree that these constructions share many properties. Using experiments based in Distributed Interchange Interventions, we show that LLMs converge on similar abstract analyses of these constructions. These analyses also reveal previously overlooked factors -- relating to frequency, filler type, and surrounding context -- that could motivate changes to standard linguistic theory. Overall, these results suggest that mechanistic, internal analyses of LLMs can push linguistic theory forward.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as factual knowledge bases; however, their capability to generate probabilistic knowledge about real-world events remains understudied. This paper investigates using probabilistic knowledge inherent in LLMs to derive probability estimates for statements concerning events and their interrelationships captured via a Bayesian Network (BN). Using LLMs in this context allows for the parameterization of BNs, enabling probabilistic modeling within specific domains. Experiments on eighty publicly available Bayesian Networks, from healthcare to finance, demonstrate that querying LLMs about the conditional probabilities of events provides meaningful results when compared to baselines, including random and uniform distributions, as well as approaches based on next-token generation probabilities. We explore how these LLM-derived distributions can serve as expert priors to refine distributions extracted from minimal data, significantly reducing systematic biases. Overall, this work introduces a promising strategy for automatically constructing Bayesian Networks by combining probabilistic knowledge extracted from LLMs with small amounts of real-world data. Additionally, we evaluate several prompting strategies for eliciting probabilistic knowledge from LLMs and establish the first comprehensive baseline for assessing LLM performance in extracting probabilistic knowledge.

  This paper presents BR-TaxQA-R, a novel dataset designed to support question answering with references in the context of Brazilian personal income tax law. The dataset contains 715 questions from the 2024 official Q\&A document published by Brazil's Internal Revenue Service, enriched with statutory norms and administrative rulings from the Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais (CARF). We implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using OpenAI embeddings for searching and GPT-4o-mini for answer generation. We compare different text segmentation strategies and benchmark our system against commercial tools such as ChatGPT andthis http URLusing RAGAS-based metrics. Results show that our custom RAG pipeline outperforms commercial systems in Response Relevancy, indicating stronger alignment with user queries, while commercial models achieve higher scores in Factual Correctness and fluency. These findings highlight a trade-off between legally grounded generation and linguistic fluency. Crucially, we argue that human expert evaluation remains essential to ensure the legal validity of AI-generated answers in high-stakes domains such as taxation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents new opportunities for chart understanding. However, due to the fine-grained nature of these tasks, applying MLLMs typically requires large, high-quality datasets for task-specific fine-tuning, leading to high data collection and training costs. To address this, we propose ChartCards, a unified chart-metadata generation framework for multi-task chart understanding. ChartCards systematically synthesizes various chart information, including data tables, visualization code, visual elements, and multi-dimensional semantic captions. By structuring this information into organized metadata, ChartCards enables a single chart to support multiple downstream tasks, such as text-to-chart retrieval, chart summarization, chart-to-table conversion, chart description, and chart question answering. Using ChartCards, we further construct MetaChart, a large-scale high-quality dataset containing 10,862 data tables, 85K charts, and 170 K high-quality chart captions. We validate the dataset through qualitative crowdsourcing evaluations and quantitative fine-tuning experiments across various chart understanding tasks. Fine-tuning six different models on MetaChart resulted in an average performance improvement of 5% across all tasks. The most notable improvements are seen in text-to-chart retrieval and chart-to-table tasks, with Long-CLIP and Llama 3.2-11B achieving improvements of 17% and 28%, respectively.

  While integrating external tools into large language models (LLMs) enhances their ability to access real-time information and domain-specific services, existing approaches focus narrowly on functional tool selection following user instructions, overlooking the context-aware personalization in tool selection. This oversight leads to suboptimal user satisfaction and inefficient tool utilization, particularly when overlapping toolsets require nuanced selection based on contextual factors. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolSpectrum, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in personalized tool utilization. Specifically, we formalize two key dimensions of personalization, user profile and environmental factors, and analyze their individual and synergistic impacts on tool utilization. Through extensive experiments on ToolSpectrum, we demonstrate that personalized tool utilization significantly improves user experience across diverse scenarios. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit the limited ability to reason jointly about user profiles and environmental factors, often prioritizing one dimension at the expense of the other. Our findings underscore the necessity of context-aware personalization in tool-augmented LLMs and reveal critical limitations for current models. Our data and code are available atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly incorporate multilingual capabilities, fueling the demand to transfer them into target language-specific models. However, most approaches, which blend the source model's embedding by replacing the source vocabulary with the target language-specific vocabulary, may constrain expressive capacity in the target language since the source model is predominantly trained on English data. In this paper, we propose Semantic Aware Linear Transfer (SALT), a novel cross-lingual transfer technique that recycles embeddings from target language Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to transmit the deep representational strengths of PLM-derived embedding to LLMs. SALT derives unique regression lines based on the similarity in the overlap of the source and target vocabularies, to handle each non-overlapping token's embedding space. Our extensive experiments show that SALT significantly outperforms other transfer methods and achieves lower loss with accelerating faster convergence during language adaptation. Notably, SALT obtains remarkable performance in cross-lingual understanding setups compared to other methods. Furthermore, we highlight the scalable use of PLMs to enhance the functionality of contemporary LLMs by conducting experiments with varying architectures.

  The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary domains. However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation as being superior to human translation from experienced professionals. In the long run, this bias could result in an irreversible decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce LiTransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering framework designed for literary translation evaluation. LiTransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, LiTransProQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation and surpassing the best state-of-the-art metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. Notably, LiTransProQA reaches human-level evaluation performance comparable to trained student evaluators. It shows broad applicability to open-source models like LLaMa3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free tool for evaluating literary translations that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations.

  Hallucination, i.e., generating factually incorrect content, remains a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). We introduce TOHA, a TOpology-based HAllucination detector in the RAG setting, which leverages a topological divergence metric to quantify the structural properties of graphs induced by attention matrices. Examining the topological divergence between prompt and response subgraphs reveals consistent patterns: higher divergence values in specific attention heads correlate with hallucinated outputs, independent of the dataset. Extensive experiments - including evaluation on question answering and summarization tasks - show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on several benchmarks while requiring minimal annotated data and computational resources. Our findings suggest that analyzing the topological structure of attention matrices can serve as an efficient and robust indicator of factual reliability in LLMs.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but their development has primarily focused on English and other high-resource languages, leaving many languages underserved. We present our latest Hindi-English bi-lingual LLM \textbf{Mantra-14B} with ~3\% average improvement in benchmark scores over both languages, outperforming models twice its size. Using a curated dataset composed of English and Hindi instruction data of 485K samples, we instruction tuned models such as Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct and Phi-4 to improve performance over both English and Hindi. Our experiments encompassing seven different LLMs of varying parameter sizes and over 140 training attempts with varying English-Hindi training data ratios demonstrated that it is possible to significantly improve multilingual performance without compromising native performance. Further, our approach avoids resource-intensive techniques like vocabulary expansion or architectural modifications, thus keeping the model size small. Our results indicate that modest fine-tuning with culturally and locally informed data can bridge performance gaps without incurring significant computational overhead. We release our training code, datasets, and models under mit and apache licenses to aid further research towards under-represented and low-resource languages.

  Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally been aligned through one-size-fits-all approaches that assume uniform human preferences, fundamentally overlooking the diversity in user values and needs. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for scalable personalized alignment of LLMs. We establish a systematic preference space characterizing psychological and behavioral dimensions, alongside diverse persona representations for robust preference inference in real-world scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we introduce \textsc{AlignX}, a large-scale dataset of over 1.3 million personalized preference examples, and develop two complementary alignment approaches: \textit{in-context alignment} directly conditioning on persona representations and \textit{preference-bridged alignment} modeling intermediate preference distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over existing methods, with an average 17.06\% accuracy gain across four benchmarks while exhibiting a strong adaptation capability to novel preferences, robustness to limited user data, and precise preference controllability. These results validate our approach toward user-adaptive AI systems.

  Speculative decoding accelerates inference in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple draft tokens simultaneously. However, existing methods often struggle with token misalignment between the training and decoding phases, limiting their performance. To address this, we propose GRIFFIN, a novel framework that incorporates a token-alignable training strategy and a token-alignable draft model to mitigate misalignment. The training strategy employs a loss masking mechanism to exclude highly misaligned tokens during training, preventing them from negatively impacting the draft model's optimization. The token-alignable draft model introduces input tokens to correct inconsistencies in generated features. Experiments on LLaMA, Vicuna, Qwen and Mixtral models demonstrate that GRIFFIN achieves an average acceptance length improvement of over 8% and a speedup ratio exceeding 7%, outperforming current speculative decoding state-of-the-art methods. Our code and GRIFFIN's draft models are released publicly inthis https URL.

  Large Language Models' safety-aligned behaviors, such as refusing harmful queries, can be represented by linear directions in activation space. Previous research modeled safety behavior with a single direction, limiting mechanistic understanding to an isolated safety feature. In this work, we discover that safety-aligned behavior is jointly controlled by multi-dimensional directions. Namely, we study the vector space of representation shifts during safety fine-tuning on Llama 3 8B for refusing jailbreaks. By studying orthogonal directions in the space, we first find that a dominant direction governs the model's refusal behavior, while multiple smaller directions represent distinct and interpretable features like hypothetical narrative and role-playing. We then measure how different directions promote or suppress the dominant direction, showing the important role of secondary directions in shaping the model's refusal representation. Finally, we demonstrate that removing certain trigger tokens in harmful queries can mitigate these directions to bypass the learned safety capability, providing new insights on understanding safety alignment vulnerability from a multi-dimensional perspective.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Showing incorrect answers to Large Language Models (LLMs) is a popular strategy to improve their performance in reasoning-intensive tasks. It is widely assumed that, in order to be helpful, the incorrect answers must be accompanied by comprehensive rationales, explicitly detailing where the mistakes are and how to correct them. However, in this work we present a counterintuitive finding: we observe that LLMs perform better in math reasoning tasks when these rationales are eliminated from the context and models are left to infer on their own what makes an incorrect answer flawed. This approach also substantially outperforms chain-of-thought prompting in our evaluations. These results are consistent across LLMs of different sizes and varying reasoning abilities. To gain an understanding of why LLMs learn from mistakes more effectively without explicit corrective rationales, we perform a thorough analysis, investigating changes in context length and answer diversity between different prompting strategies, and their effect on performance. We also examine evidence of overfitting to the in-context rationales when these are provided, and study the extent to which LLMs are able to autonomously infer high-quality corrective rationales given only incorrect answers as input. We find evidence that, while incorrect answers are more beneficial for LLM learning than additional diverse correct answers, explicit corrective rationales over-constrain the model, thus limiting those benefits.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present BenCzechMark (BCM), the first comprehensive Czech language benchmark designed for large language models, offering diverse tasks, multiple task formats, and multiple evaluation metrics. Its duel scoring system is grounded in statistical significance theory and uses aggregation across tasks inspired by social preference theory. Our benchmark encompasses 50 challenging tasks, with corresponding test datasets, primarily in native Czech, with 14 newly collected ones. These tasks span 8 categories and cover diverse domains, including historical Czech news, essays from pupils or language learners, and spoken word. Furthermore, we collect and clean BUT-Large Czech Collection, the largest publicly available clean Czech language corpus, and use it for (i) contamination analysis and (ii) continuous pretraining of the first Czech-centric 7B language model with Czech-specific tokenization. We use our model as a baseline for comparison with publicly available multilingual models. Lastly, we release and maintain a leaderboard with existing 50 model submissions, where new model submissions can be made atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent works integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have shown promising improvements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on closed-ended tasks, leaving a gap in evaluating performance on more complex, real-world scenarios. This limitation also hinders a thorough assessment of KGs' potential to reduce hallucinations in LLMs. To address this, we introduce OKGQA, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs augmented with KGs in open-ended, real-world question answering settings. OKGQA reflects practical complexities through diverse question types and incorporates metrics to quantify both hallucination rates and reasoning improvements in LLM+KG models. To consider the scenarios in which KGs may contain varying levels of errors, we propose a benchmark variant, OKGQA-P, to assess model performance when the semantics and structure of KGs are deliberately perturbed and contaminated. In this paper, we aims to (1) explore whether KGs can make LLMs more trustworthy in an open-ended setting, and (2) conduct a comparative analysis to shed light on method design. We believe this study can facilitate a more complete performance comparison and encourages continuous improvement in integrating KGs with LLMs to mitigate hallucination, and make LLMs more trustworthy. Code and data are released atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Instruction tuning for large language models (LLMs) can drive them to produce results consistent with human goals in specific downstream tasks. However, the process of continual instruction tuning (CIT) for LLMs may bring about the catastrophic forgetting (CF) problem, where previously learned abilities are degraded. Recent methods try to alleviate the CF problem by modifying models or replaying data, which may only remember the surface-level pattern of instructions and get confused on held-out tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel continual instruction tuning method based on Key-part Information Gain (KPIG). Our method computes the information gain on masked parts to dynamically replay data and refine the training objective, which enables LLMs to capture task-aware information relevant to the correct response and alleviate overfitting to general descriptions in instructions. In addition, we propose two metrics, P-score and V-score, to measure the generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior performance on both seen and held-out tasks.

  _Chao Zhang, Xin Shi, Xueqiao Zhang, Yifan Zhu, Yi Yang, Yawei Luo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) have improved emotional support generation by fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, common psychological errors still persist. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) shows promise in reducing such errors through pairwise preference learning, its effectiveness in ESC tasks is limited by two key challenges: (1) Entangled data structure: Existing ESC data inherently entangles psychological strategies and response content, making it difficult to construct high-quality preference pairs; and (2) Optimization ambiguity: Applying vanilla DPO to such entangled pairwise data leads to ambiguous training objectives. To address these issues, we introduce Inferential Preference Mining (IPM) to construct high-quality preference data, forming the IPM-PrefDial dataset. Building upon this data, we propose a Decoupled ESC framework inspired by Gross's Extended Process Model of Emotion Regulation, which decomposes the ESC task into two sequential subtasks: strategy planning and empathic response generation. Each was trained via SFT and subsequently enhanced by DPO to align with the psychological preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Decoupled ESC framework outperforms joint optimization baselines, reducing preference bias and improving response quality.

  _Junlong Tong, Jinlan Fu, Zixuan Lin, Yingqi Fan, Anhao Zhao, Hui Su, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are primarily designed for batch processing. Existing methods for adapting LLMs to streaming rely either on expensive re-encoding or specialized architectures with limited scalability. This work identifies three key mismatches in adapting batch-oriented LLMs to streaming: (1) input-attention, (2) output-attention, and (3) position-ID mismatches. While it is commonly assumed that the latter two mismatches require frequent re-encoding, our analysis reveals that only the input-attention mismatch significantly impacts performance, indicating re-encoding outputs is largely unnecessary. To better understand this discrepancy with the common assumption, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the impact of position encoding on LLMs in streaming, showing that preserving relative positions within source and target contexts is more critical than maintaining absolute order. Motivated by the above analysis, we introduce a group position encoding paradigm built on batch architectures to enhance consistency between streaming and batch modes. Extensive experiments on cross-lingual and cross-modal tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our method requires no architectural modifications, exhibits strong generalization in both streaming and batch modes. The code is available at repositorythis https URL.

  _Rishanth Rajendhran, Amir Zadeh, Matthew Sarte, Chuan Li, Mohit Iyyer_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Metrics like FactScore and VeriScore that evaluate long-form factuality operate by decomposing an input response into atomic claims and then individually verifying each claim. While effective and interpretable, these methods incur numerous LLM calls and can take upwards of 100 seconds to evaluate a single response, limiting their practicality in large-scale evaluation and training scenarios. To address this, we propose VeriFastScore, which leverages synthetic data to fine-tune Llama3.1 8B for simultaneously extracting and verifying all verifiable claims within a given text based on evidence from Google Search. We show that this task cannot be solved via few-shot prompting with closed LLMs due to its complexity: the model receives ~4K tokens of evidence on average and needs to concurrently decompose claims, judge their verifiability, and verify them against noisy evidence. However, our fine-tuned VeriFastScore model demonstrates strong correlation with the original VeriScore pipeline at both the example level (r=0.80) and system level (r=0.94) while achieving an overall speedup of 6.6x (9.9x excluding evidence retrieval) over VeriScore. To facilitate future factuality research, we publicly release our VeriFastScore model and synthetic datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for sensitive applications has highlighted the need for effective watermarking techniques to ensure the provenance and accountability of AI-generated text. However, most existing watermarking methods require access to the decoding process, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. One illustrative example is the use of LLMs by dishonest reviewers in the context of academic peer review, where conference organizers have no access to the model used but still need to detect AI-generated reviews. Motivated by this gap, we introduce In-Context Watermarking (ICW), which embeds watermarks into generated text solely through prompt engineering, leveraging LLMs' in-context learning and instruction-following abilities. We investigate four ICW strategies at different levels of granularity, each paired with a tailored detection method. We further examine the Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) setting as a specific case study, in which watermarking is covertly triggered by modifying input documents such as academic manuscripts. Our experiments validate the feasibility of ICW as a model-agnostic, practical watermarking approach. Moreover, our findings suggest that as LLMs become more capable, ICW offers a promising direction for scalable and accessible content attribution.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, particularly in long-form generations. A promising direction to mitigate hallucination is to teach LLMs to express uncertainty explicitly when they lack sufficient knowledge. However, existing work lacks direct and fair evaluation of LLMs' ability to express uncertainty effectively in long-form generation. To address this gap, we first introduce UNCLE, a benchmark designed to evaluate uncertainty expression in both long- and short-form question answering (QA). UNCLE spans five domains and comprises 4k long-form QA instances and over 20k short-form QA pairs. Our dataset is the first to directly bridge short- and long-form QA with paired questions and gold-standard answers. Along with the benchmark, we propose a suite of new metrics to assess the models' capabilities to selectively express uncertainty. Using UNCLE, we then demonstrate that current models fail to convey uncertainty appropriately in long-form generation. We further explore both prompt-based and training-based methods to improve models' performance, with the training-based methods yielding greater gains. Further analysis of alignment gaps between short- and long-form uncertainty expression highlights promising directions for future research using UNCLE.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucinations -- plausible yet erroneous outputs -- remain a critical barrier to reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs). We present the first systematic study linking hallucination incidence to internal-state drift induced by incremental context injection. Using TruthfulQA, we construct two 16-round "titration" tracks per question: one appends relevant but partially flawed snippets, the other injects deliberately misleading content. Across six open-source LLMs, we track overt hallucination rates with a tri-perspective detector and covert dynamics via cosine, entropy, JS and Spearman drifts of hidden states and attention maps. Results reveal (1) monotonic growth of hallucination frequency and representation drift that plateaus after 5--7 rounds; (2) relevant context drives deeper semantic assimilation, producing high-confidence "self-consistent" hallucinations, whereas irrelevant context induces topic-drift errors anchored by attention re-routing; and (3) convergence of JS-Drift ($\sim0.69$) and Spearman-Drift ($\sim0$) marks an "attention-locking" threshold beyond which hallucinations solidify and become resistant to correction. Correlation analyses expose a seesaw between assimilation capacity and attention diffusion, clarifying size-dependent error modes. These findings supply empirical foundations for intrinsic hallucination prediction and context-aware mitigation mechanisms.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to AI applications worldwide, necessitating robust multilingual safety alignment to ensure secure deployment across diverse linguistic contexts. Existing preference learning methods for safety alignment, such as RLHF and DPO, are primarily monolingual and struggle with noisy multilingual data. To address these limitations, we introduce Multilingual reward gaP Optimization (MPO), a novel approach that leverages the well-aligned safety capabilities of the dominant language (English) to improve safety alignment across multiple languages. MPO directly minimizes the reward gap difference between the dominant language and target languages, effectively transferring safety capabilities while preserving the original strengths of the dominant language. Extensive experiments on three LLMs, LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2 and Qwen2.5, validate MPO's efficacy in multilingual safety alignment without degrading general multilingual utility.

  This paper introduces a method for detecting inappropriately targeting language in online conversations by integrating crowd and expert annotations with ChatGPT. We focus on English conversation threads from Reddit, examining comments that target individuals or groups. Our approach involves a comprehensive annotation framework that labels a diverse data set for various target categories and specific target words within the conversational context. We perform a comparative analysis of annotations from human experts, crowd annotators, and ChatGPT, revealing strengths and limitations of each method in recognizing both explicit hate speech and subtler discriminatory language. Our findings highlight the significant role of contextual factors in identifying hate speech and uncover new categories of targeting, such as social belief and body image. We also address the challenges and subjective judgments involved in annotation and the limitations of ChatGPT in grasping nuanced language. This study provides insights for improving automated content moderation strategies to enhance online safety and inclusivity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances large language models (LLMs) by enabling step-by-step problem-solving, yet its extension to Long-CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to increased token length. Existing compression approaches -- instance-level and token-level -- either sacrifice essential local reasoning signals like reflection or yield incoherent outputs. To address these limitations, we propose R1-Compress, a two-stage chunk-level compression framework that preserves both local information and coherence. Our method segments Long-CoT into manageable chunks, applies LLM-driven inner-chunk compression, and employs an inter-chunk search mechanism to select the short and coherent sequence. Experiments on Qwen2.5-Instruct models across MATH500, AIME24, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that R1-Compress significantly reduces token usage while maintaining comparable reasoning accuracy. On MATH500, R1-Compress achieves an accuracy of 92.4%, with only a 0.6% drop compared to the Long-CoT baseline, while reducing token usage by about 20%. Source code will be available atthis https URL

  We introduce a transformer-based morpheme segmentation system that augments a low-resource training signal through multitask learning and LLM-generated synthetic data. Our framework jointly predicts morphological segments and glosses from orthographic input, leveraging shared linguistic representations obtained through a common documentary process to enhance model generalization. To further address data scarcity, we integrate synthetic training data generated by large language models (LLMs) using in-context learning. Experimental results on the SIGMORPHON 2023 dataset show that our approach significantly improves word-level segmentation accuracy and morpheme-level F1-score across multiple low-resource languages.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, conventional CoT relies on reasoning steps explicitly verbalized in natural language, introducing inefficiencies and limiting its applicability to abstract reasoning. To address this, there has been growing research interest in latent CoT reasoning, where inference occurs within latent spaces. By decoupling reasoning from language, latent reasoning promises richer cognitive representations and more flexible, faster inference. Researchers have explored various directions in this promising field, including training methodologies, structural innovations, and internal reasoning mechanisms. This paper presents a comprehensive overview and analysis of this reasoning paradigm. We begin by proposing a unified taxonomy from four perspectives: token-wise strategies, internal mechanisms, analysis, and applications. We then provide in-depth discussions and comparative analyses of representative methods, highlighting their design patterns, strengths, and open challenges. We aim to provide a structured foundation for advancing this emerging direction in LLM reasoning. The relevant papers will be regularly updated atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong instruction-following capabilities in text-based tasks. However, this ability often deteriorates in multimodal models after alignment with non-text modalities such as images or audio. While several recent efforts have investigated instruction-following performance in text and vision-language models, instruction-following in audio-based large language models remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce IFEval-Audio, a novel evaluation dataset designed to assess the ability to follow instructions in an audio LLM. IFEval-Audio contains 280 audio-instruction-answer triples across six diverse dimensions: Content, Capitalization, Symbol, List Structure, Length, and Format. Each example pairs an audio input with a text instruction, requiring the model to generate an output that follows a specified structure. We benchmark state-of-the-art audio LLMs on their ability to follow audio-involved instructions. The dataset is released publicly to support future research in this emerging area.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance, the multimodal instruction tuning stage often causes catastrophic forgetting of the base LLM's language ability, even in strong models like Llama3. To address this, we propose Locate-then-Merge, a training-free parameter fusion framework that first locates important parameters and then selectively merges them. We further introduce Neuron-Fusion, a neuron-level strategy that preserves the influence of neurons with large parameter shifts--neurons likely responsible for newly acquired visual capabilities--while attenuating the influence of neurons with smaller changes that likely encode general-purpose language skills. This design enables better retention of visual adaptation while mitigating language degradation. Experiments on 13 benchmarks across both language and visual tasks show that Neuron-Fusion consistently outperforms existing model merging methods. Further analysis reveals that our method effectively reduces context hallucination in generation.

  We present a Japanese domain-specific language model for the pharmaceutical field, developed through continual pretraining on 2 billion Japanese pharmaceutical tokens and 8 billion English biomedical tokens. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce three new benchmarks: YakugakuQA, based on national pharmacist licensing exams; NayoseQA, which tests cross-lingual synonym and terminology normalization; and SogoCheck, a novel task designed to assess consistency reasoning between paired statements. We evaluate our model against both open-source medical LLMs and commercial models, including GPT-4o. Results show that our domain-specific model outperforms existing open models and achieves competitive performance with commercial ones, particularly on terminology-heavy and knowledge-based tasks. Interestingly, even GPT-4o performs poorly on SogoCheck, suggesting that cross-sentence consistency reasoning remains an open challenge. Our benchmark suite offers a broader diagnostic lens for pharmaceutical NLP, covering factual recall, lexical variation, and logical consistency. This work demonstrates the feasibility of building practical, secure, and cost-effective language models for Japanese domain-specific applications, and provides reusable evaluation resources for future research in pharmaceutical and healthcare NLP.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective emotional support hinges on understanding users' emotions and needs to provide meaningful comfort during multi-turn interactions. Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential for expressing empathy; however, they often deliver generic and one-size-fits-all responses that fail to address users' specific needs. To tackle this issue, we propose a self-evolution framework designed to help LLMs improve their responses to better align with users' implicit preferences concerning user profiles (personalities), emotional states, and specific situations. Our framework consists of two distinct phases: \textit{(1)} \textit{Emotional Support Experience Acquisition}, where LLMs are fine-tuned on limited emotional support conversation data to provide basic support, and \textit{(2)} \textit{Self-Improvement for Personalized Emotional Support}, where LLMs leverage self-reflection and self-refinement to generate personalized responses. Through iterative direct preference optimization between the pre- and post-refined responses, our model generates responses that reflect a better understanding of the user's implicit preferences. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the model's performance in emotional support, reducing unhelpful responses and minimizing discrepancies between user preferences and model outputs.

  We introduce KoLasSimpleQA, the first benchmark evaluating the multilingual factual ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by existing research, we created the question set with features such as single knowledge point coverage, absolute objectivity, unique answers, and temporal stability. These questions enable efficient evaluation using the LLM-as-judge paradigm, testing both the LLMs' factual memory and self-awareness ("know what they don't know"). KoLasSimpleQA expands existing research in two key dimensions: (1) Breadth (Multilingual Coverage): It includes 9 languages, supporting global applicability evaluation. (2) Depth (Dual Domain Design): It covers both the general domain (global facts) and the language-specific domain (such as history, culture, and regional traditions) for a comprehensive assessment of multilingual capabilities. We evaluated mainstream LLMs, including traditional LLM and emerging Large Reasoning Models. Results show significant performance differences between the two domains, particularly in performance metrics, ranking, calibration, and robustness. This highlights the need for targeted evaluation and optimization in multilingual contexts. We hope KoLasSimpleQA will help the research community better identify LLM capability boundaries in multilingual contexts and provide guidance for model optimization. We will release KoLasSimpleQA atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Determining the veracity of atomic claims is an imperative component of many recently proposed fact-checking systems. Many approaches tackle this problem by first retrieving evidence by querying a search engine and then performing classification by providing the evidence set and atomic claim to a large language model, but this process deviates from what a human would do in order to perform the task. Recent work attempted to address this issue by proposing iterative evidence retrieval, allowing for evidence to be collected several times and only when necessary. Continuing along this line of research, we propose a novel claim verification system, called EMULATE, which is designed to better emulate human actions through the use of a multi-agent framework where each agent performs a small part of the larger task, such as ranking search results according to predefined criteria or evaluating webpage content. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show clear improvements over prior work, demonstrating the efficacy of our new multi-agent framework.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly pretrained on vast corpora of text without utilizing contextual metadata such as source, quality, or topic, leading to a context-free learning paradigm. While recent studies suggest that adding metadata like URL information as context (i.e., auxiliary inputs not used in the loss calculation) can improve training efficiency and downstream performance, they offer limited understanding of which types of metadata are truly effective and under what conditions. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation and find that not all metadata types contribute equally. Only URL context speeds up training, whereas quality scores and topic/format domain information offer no clear benefit. Furthermore, the improved downstream performances of URL conditioning emerge only when longer prompts are used at inference time. In addition, we demonstrate that context-aware pretraining enables more controllable generation than context-free pretraining, in a classifier-free guidance fashion. Although topic and format metadata do not accelerate training, they are effective for steering outputs, offering human-interpretable control over generation.

  Prior benchmarks for evaluating the domain-specific knowledge of large language models (LLMs) lack the scalability to handle complex academic tasks. To address this, we introduce \texttt{ScholarBench}, a benchmark centered on deep expert knowledge and complex academic problem-solving, which evaluates the academic reasoning ability of LLMs and is constructed through a three-step process. \texttt{ScholarBench} targets more specialized and logically complex contexts derived from academic literature, encompassing five distinct problem types. Unlike prior benchmarks, \texttt{ScholarBench} evaluates the abstraction, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs across eight distinct research domains. To ensure high-quality evaluation data, we define category-specific example attributes and design questions that are aligned with the characteristic research methodologies and discourse structures of each domain. Additionally, this benchmark operates as an English-Korean bilingual dataset, facilitating simultaneous evaluation for linguistic capabilities of LLMs in both languages. The benchmark comprises 5,031 examples in Korean and 5,309 in English, with even state-of-the-art models like o3-mini achieving an average evaluation score of only 0.543, demonstrating the challenging nature of this benchmark.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but these token-level reasoning chains are computationally expensive and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR), a novel framework that dynamically compresses reasoning processes in latent space through a two-stage training approach. First, during supervised fine-tuning, CoLaR extends beyond next-token prediction by incorporating an auxiliary next compressed embedding prediction objective. This process merges embeddings of consecutive tokens using a compression factor randomly sampled from a predefined range, and trains a specialized latent head to predict distributions of subsequent compressed embeddings. Second, we enhance CoLaR through reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages the latent head's non-deterministic nature to explore diverse reasoning paths and exploit more compact ones. This approach enables CoLaR to: i) perform reasoning at a dense latent level (i.e., silently), substantially reducing reasoning chain length, and ii) dynamically adjust reasoning speed at inference time by simply prompting the desired compression factor. Extensive experiments across four mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that CoLaR achieves 14.1% higher accuracy than latent-based baseline methods at comparable compression ratios, and reduces reasoning chain length by 53.3% with only 4.8% performance degradation compared to explicit CoT method. Moreover, when applied to more challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, our RL-enhanced CoLaR demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.4% while dramatically reducing latent reasoning chain length by 82.8%.

  _Ercong Nie, Helmut Schmid, Hinrich Sch√ºtze_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language confusion -- where large language models (LLMs) generate unintended languages against the user's need -- remains a critical challenge, especially for English-centric models. We present the first mechanistic interpretability (MI) study of language confusion, combining behavioral benchmarking with neuron-level analysis. Using the Language Confusion Benchmark (LCB), we show that confusion points (CPs) -- specific positions where language switches occur -- are central to this phenomenon. Through layer-wise analysis with TunedLens and targeted neuron attribution, we reveal that transition failures in the final layers drive confusion. We further demonstrate that editing a small set of critical neurons, identified via comparative analysis with multilingual-tuned models, substantially mitigates confusion without harming general competence or fluency. Our approach matches multilingual alignment in confusion reduction for most languages and yields cleaner, higher-quality outputs. These findings provide new insights into the internal dynamics of LLMs and highlight neuron-level interventions as a promising direction for robust, interpretable multilingual language modeling.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Small large language models (sLLMs) offer the advantage of being lightweight and efficient, which makes them suitable for resource-constrained environments. However, sLLMs often struggle to maintain topic consistency in task-oriented dialogue systems, which is critical for scenarios such as service chatbots. Specifically, it is important to ensure that the model denies off-topic or malicious inputs and adheres to its intended functionality so as to prevent potential misuse and uphold reliability. Towards this, existing activation engineering approaches have been proposed to manipulate internal activations during inference. While these methods are effective in certain scenarios, our preliminary experiments reveal their limitations in ensuring topic adherence. Therefore, to address this, we propose a novel approach termed Entropy-scaled Steering vectors for Topic Maintenance (EnSToM). EnSToM dynamically adjusts the steering intensity based on input uncertainty, which allows the model to handle off-topic distractors effectively while preserving on-topic accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that EnSToM achieves significant performance gain with a relatively small data size compared to fine-tuning approaches. By improving topic adherence without compromising efficiency, our approach provides a robust solution for enhancing sLLM-based dialogue systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) infer user's demographic information from subtle cues in the conversation -- a phenomenon called implicit personalization. Prior work has shown that such inferences can lead to lower quality responses for users assumed to be from minority groups, even when no demographic information is explicitly provided. In this work, we systematically explore how LLMs respond to stereotypical cues using controlled synthetic conversations, by analyzing the models' latent user representations through both model internals and generated answers to targeted user questions. Our findings reveal that LLMs do infer demographic attributes based on these stereotypical signals, which for a number of groups even persists when the user explicitly identifies with a different demographic group. Finally, we show that this form of stereotype-driven implicit personalization can be effectively mitigated by intervening on the model's internal representations using a trained linear probe to steer them toward the explicitly stated identity. Our results highlight the need for greater transparency and control in how LLMs represent user identity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adapting cultural values in Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant challenges, particularly due to biases and limited training data. Prior work primarily aligns LLMs with different cultural values using World Values Survey (WVS) data. However, it remains unclear whether this approach effectively captures cultural nuances or produces distinct cultural representations for various downstream tasks. In this paper, we systematically investigate WVS-based training for cultural value adaptation and find that relying solely on survey data can homogenize cultural norms and interfere with factual knowledge. To investigate these issues, we augment WVS with encyclopedic and scenario-based cultural narratives from Wikipedia and NormAd. While these narratives may have variable effects on downstream tasks, they consistently improve cultural distinctiveness than survey data alone. Our work highlights the inherent complexity of aligning cultural values with the goal of guiding task-specific behavior.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable ability in cross-lingual tasks. Understanding how LLMs acquire this ability is crucial for their interpretability. To quantify the cross-lingual ability of LLMs accurately, we propose a Word-Level Cross-Lingual Translation Task. To find how LLMs learn cross-lingual ability, we trace the outputs of LLMs' intermediate layers in the word translation task. We identify and distinguish two distinct behaviors in the forward pass of LLMs: co-occurrence behavior and semantic pivot behavior. We attribute LLMs' two distinct behaviors to the co-occurrence frequency of words and find the semantic pivot from the pre-training dataset. Finally, to apply our findings to improve the cross-lingual ability of LLMs, we reconstruct a semantic pivot-aware pre-training dataset using documents with a high proportion of semantic pivots. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing cross-lingual ability. Our research contributes insights into the interpretability of LLMs and offers a method for improving LLMs' cross-lingual ability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Embodied agents empowered by large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in household object rearrangement tasks. However, these tasks primarily focus on single-turn interactions with simplified instructions, which do not truly reflect the challenges of providing meaningful assistance to users. To provide personalized assistance, embodied agents must understand the unique semantics that users assign to the physical world (e.g., favorite cup, breakfast routine) by leveraging prior interaction history to interpret dynamic, real-world instructions. Yet, the effectiveness of embodied agents in utilizing memory for personalized assistance remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we present MEMENTO, a personalized embodied agent evaluation framework designed to comprehensively assess memory utilization capabilities to provide personalized assistance. Our framework consists of a two-stage memory evaluation process design that enables quantifying the impact of memory utilization on task performance. This process enables the evaluation of agents' understanding of personalized knowledge in object rearrangement tasks by focusing on its role in goal interpretation: (1) the ability to identify target objects based on personal meaning (object semantics), and (2) the ability to infer object-location configurations from consistent user patterns, such as routines (user patterns). Our experiments across various LLMs reveal significant limitations in memory utilization, with even frontier models like GPT-4o experiencing a 30.5% performance drop when required to reference multiple memories, particularly in tasks involving user patterns. These findings, along with our detailed analyses and case studies, provide valuable insights for future research in developing more effective personalized embodied agents.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM) routing is a pivotal technique for navigating a diverse landscape of LLMs, aiming to select the best-performing LLMs tailored to the domains of user queries, while managing computational resources. However, current routing approaches often face limitations in scalability when dealing with a large pool of specialized LLMs, or in their adaptability to extending model scope and evolving capability domains. To overcome those challenges, we propose InferenceDynamics, a flexible and scalable multi-dimensional routing framework by modeling the capability and knowledge of models. We operate it on our comprehensive dataset RouteMix, and demonstrate its effectiveness and generalizability in group-level routing using modern benchmarks including MMLU-Pro, GPQA, BigGenBench, and LiveBench, showcasing its ability to identify and leverage top-performing models for given tasks, leading to superior outcomes with efficient resource utilization. The broader adoption of Inference Dynamics can empower users to harness the full specialized potential of the LLM ecosystem, and our code will be made publicly available to encourage further research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) offer impressive performance but are impractical for resource-constrained deployment due to high latency and energy consumption. Knowledge distillation (KD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from a large teacher to a smaller student model. However, conventional KD, notably approaches like Forward KL (FKL) and Reverse KL (RKL), apply uniform divergence loss across the entire vocabulary, neglecting token-level prediction discrepancies. By investigating these representative divergences via gradient analysis, we reveal that FKL boosts underestimated tokens, while RKL suppresses overestimated ones, showing their complementary roles. Based on this observation, we propose Token-wise Distillation (ToDi), a novel method that adaptively combines FKL and RKL per token using a sigmoid-based weighting function derived from the teacher-student probability log-ratio. ToDi dynamically emphasizes the appropriate divergence for each token, enabling precise distribution alignment. We demonstrate that ToDi consistently outperforms recent distillation baselines using uniform or less granular strategies across instruction-following benchmarks. Extensive ablation studies and efficiency analysis further validate ToDi's effectiveness and practicality.

  Iterative RAG for multi-hop question answering faces challenges with lengthy contexts and the buildup of irrelevant information. This hinders a model's capacity to process and reason over retrieved content and limits performance. While recent methods focus on compressing retrieved information, they are either restricted to single-round RAG, require finetuning or lack scalability in iterative RAG. To address these challenges, we propose Notes Writing, a method that generates concise and relevant notes from retrieved documents at each step, thereby reducing noise and retaining only essential information. This indirectly increases the effective context length of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to reason and plan more effectively while processing larger volumes of input text. Notes Writing is framework agnostic and can be integrated with different iterative RAG methods. We demonstrate its effectiveness with three iterative RAG methods, across two models and four evaluation datasets. Notes writing yields an average improvement of 15.6 percentage points overall, with minimal increase in output tokens.

  The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables flexible and interpretable automatic evaluations. In the field of machine translation evaluation, utilizing LLMs with translation error annotations based on Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) yields more human-aligned judgments. However, current LLM-based evaluation methods still face challenges in accurately identifying error spans and assessing their severity. In this paper, we propose HiMATE, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Machine Translation Evaluation. We argue that existing approaches inadequately exploit the fine-grained structural and semantic information within the MQM hierarchy. To address this, we develop a hierarchical multi-agent system grounded in the MQM error typology, enabling granular evaluation of subtype errors. Two key strategies are incorporated to further mitigate systemic hallucinations within the framework: the utilization of the model's self-reflection capability and the facilitation of agent discussion involving asymmetric information. Empirically, HiMATE outperforms competitive baselines across different datasets in conducting human-aligned evaluations. Further analyses underscore its significant advantage in error span detection and severity assessment, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 89% over the best-performing baseline. We make our code and data publicly available atthis https URL.

  The achievements of Large Language Models in Natural Language Processing, especially for high-resource languages, call for a better understanding of their characteristics from a cognitive perspective. Researchers have attempted to evaluate artificial models by testing their ability to predict behavioral (e.g., eye-tracking fixations) and physiological (e.g., brain responses) variables during language processing (e.g., reading/listening). In this paper, we propose using spontaneous speech corpora to derive production variables (speech reductions, prosodic prominences) and applying them in a similar fashion. More precisely, we extract. We then test models trained with a standard procedure on different pretraining datasets (written, spoken, and mixed genres) for their ability to predict these two variables. Our results show that, after some fine-tuning, the models can predict these production variables well above baselines. We also observe that spoken genre training data provides more accurate predictions than written genres. These results contribute to the broader effort of using high-quality speech corpora as benchmarks for LLMs.

  Large language models often retain unintended content, prompting growing interest in knowledge unlearning. Recent approaches emphasize localized unlearning, which restricts parameter updates to specific regions in an effort to remove target knowledge while preserving unrelated general knowledge. However, their effectiveness remains uncertain due to the lack of robust and thorough evaluation of the trade-off between the competing goals of unlearning. In this paper, we begin by revisiting existing localized unlearning approaches. We then conduct controlled experiments to rigorously evaluate whether local parameter updates causally contribute to unlearning. Our findings reveal that the set of parameters that must be modified for effective unlearning is not strictly determined, challenging the core assumption of localized unlearning that parameter locality is inherently indicative of effective knowledge removal.

  Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated superior logical capabilities compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), gaining significant attention. Despite their impressive performance, the potential for stronger reasoning abilities to introduce more severe security vulnerabilities remains largely underexplored. Existing jailbreak methods often struggle to balance effectiveness with robustness against adaptive safety mechanisms. In this work, we propose SEAL, a novel jailbreak attack that targets LRMs through an adaptive encryption pipeline designed to override their reasoning processes and evade potential adaptive alignment. Specifically, SEAL introduces a stacked encryption approach that combines multiple ciphers to overwhelm the models reasoning capabilities, effectively bypassing built-in safety mechanisms. To further prevent LRMs from developing countermeasures, we incorporate two dynamic strategies - random and adaptive - that adjust the cipher length, order, and combination. Extensive experiments on real-world reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1, Claude Sonnet, and OpenAI GPT-o4, validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, SEAL achieves an attack success rate of 80.8% on GPT o4-mini, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin of 27.2%.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with issues like hallucinations and outdated information. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses these issues by grounding LLM outputs in external knowledge with an Information Retrieval (IR) system. Building on this foundation, graph-based RAG systems go a step further by retrieving subgraphs, which preserve the relationships between knowledge entities and provide more comprehensive context. However, graph RAG faces two challenges: (1) Retrieving relevant information introduces irrelevant nodes (especially in dense graph databases, where retrieval usually extends to adjacent nodes), and leads to overly lengthy inputs that hinder efficiency; (2) The representation gap between graph and language during generation with LLMs limits the ability to fully leverage graph structures for enhanced understanding. To address these limitations, we propose Align-GRAG, a novel reasoning-guided dual alignment framework in post-retrieval phrase. It first formulates a subgraph by retrieving nodes and edges. Then an Aligner is proposed to jointly optimizes a graph encoder with LLM-summarized reasoning. It achieves dual alignment of graph node and representation by leveraging KL divergence loss and contrastive loss, facilitating efficient pruning of irrelevant knowledge and establishing a unified semantic space. The Generator integrates the aligned graph data with LLM to produce coherent and accurate answers. Experiments on GraphQA benchmark across three tasks (including common sense reasoning, scene graph understanding, and knowledge graph reasoning) validate the effectiveness of our method. The code will be available upon accepted.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  An objective, face-valid way to assess the originality of creative ideas is to measure how rare each idea is within a population -- an approach long used in creativity research but difficult to automate at scale. Tabulating response frequencies via manual bucketing of idea rephrasings is labor-intensive, error-prone, and brittle under large corpora. We introduce a fully automated, psychometrically validated pipeline for frequency-based originality scoring. Our method, MuseRAG, combines large language models (LLMs) with an externally orchestrated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. Given a new idea, the system retrieves semantically similar prior idea buckets and zero-shot prompts the LLM to judge whether the new idea belongs to an existing bucket or forms a new one. The resulting buckets enable computation of frequency-based originality metrics. Across five datasets (N=1143, n_ideas=16294), MuseRAG matches human annotators in idea clustering structure and resolution (AMI = 0.59) and in participant-level scoring (r = 0.89) -- while exhibiting strong convergent and external validity. Our work enables intent-sensitive, human-aligned originality scoring at scale to aid creativity research.

  Idioms have long posed a challenge due to their unique linguistic properties, which set them apart from other common expressions. While recent studies have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to handle idioms across various tasks, e.g., idiom-containing sentence generation and idiomatic machine translation, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of idiom processing in LLMs, particularly in multilingual settings. To this end, we introduce MIDAS, a new large-scale dataset of idioms in six languages, each paired with its corresponding meaning. Leveraging this resource, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' idiom processing ability, identifying key factors that influence their performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs rely not only on memorization, but also adopt a hybrid approach that integrates contextual cues and reasoning, especially when processing compositional idioms. This implies that idiom understanding in LLMs emerges from an interplay between internal knowledge retrieval and reasoning-based inference.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but controlling their behavior reliably remains challenging, especially in open-ended generation settings. This paper introduces a novel supervised steering approach that operates in sparse, interpretable representation spaces. We employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs)to obtain sparse latent representations that aim to disentangle semantic attributes from model activations. Then we train linear classifiers to identify a small subspace of task-relevant dimensions in latent representations. Finally, we learn supervised steering vectors constrained to this subspace, optimized to align with target behaviors. Experiments across sentiment, truthfulness, and politics polarity steering tasks with multiple LLMs demonstrate that our supervised steering vectors achieve higher success rates with minimal degradation in generation quality compared to existing methods. Further analysis reveals that a notably small subspace is sufficient for effective steering, enabling more targeted and interpretable interventions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Can large language models (LLMs) admit their mistakes when they should know better? In this work, we define the behavior of acknowledging errors in previously generated answers as "retraction" and aim to understand when and why LLMs choose to retract. We first construct model-specific datasets to evaluate whether a model will retract an incorrect answer that contradicts its own parametric knowledge. While LLMs are capable of retraction, they do so only infrequently. We demonstrate that retraction is closely tied to previously identified indicators of models' internal belief: models fail to retract wrong answers that they "believe" to be factually correct. Steering experiments further demonstrate that internal belief causally influences model retraction. In particular, when the model does not believe its answer, this not only encourages the model to attempt to verify the answer, but also alters attention behavior during self-verification. Finally, we demonstrate that simple supervised fine-tuning significantly improves retraction performance by helping the model learn more accurate internal beliefs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as substitutes for human participants in cognitive tasks, but their ability to simulate human behavioral variability remains unclear. This study examines whether LLMs can approximate individual differences in the phonemic fluency task, where participants generate words beginning with a target letter. We evaluated 34 model configurations, varying prompt specificity, sampling temperature, and model type, and compared outputs to responses from 106 human participants. While some configurations, especially Claude 3.7 Sonnet, matched human averages and lexical preferences, none reproduced the scope of human variability. LLM outputs were consistently less diverse and structurally rigid, and LLM ensembles failed to increase diversity. Network analyses further revealed fundamental differences in retrieval structure between humans and models. These results highlight key limitations in using LLMs to simulate human cognition and behavior.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a widely used paradigm to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs) without compromising generation quality. It works by efficiently drafting multiple tokens using a compact model and then verifying them in parallel using the target LLM. Notably, Self-Speculative Decoding proposes skipping certain layers to construct the draft model, which eliminates the need for additional parameters or training. Despite its strengths, we observe in this work that drafting with layer skipping exhibits significant sensitivity to domain shifts, leading to a substantial drop in acceleration performance. To enhance the domain generalizability of this paradigm, we introduce KNN-SSD, an algorithm that leverages K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search to match different skipped layers with various domain inputs. We evaluated our algorithm in various models and multiple tasks, observing that its application leads to 1.3x-1.6x speedup in LLM inference.

In this paper, we address this gap by introducing the first diverse benchmark tailored for educational scenarios, incorporating synthetic data containing 9 major scenarios and over 4,000 distinct educational contexts. To enable comprehensive assessment, we propose a set of multi-dimensional evaluation metrics that cover 12 critical aspects relevant to both teachers and students. We further apply human annotation to ensure the effectiveness of the model-generated evaluation responses. Additionally, we succeed to train a relatively small-scale model on our constructed dataset and demonstrate that it can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art large models (e.g., Deepseek V3, Qwen Max) on the test set. Overall, this work provides a practical foundation for the development and evaluation of education-oriented language models. Code and data are released atthis https URL.

  Distilling reasoning paths from teacher to student models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) provides a shortcut for improving the reasoning ability of smaller Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reasoning paths generated by teacher models often reflect only surface-level traces of their underlying authentic reasoning. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that authentic reasoning involves a complex interweaving between meta-reasoning (which selects appropriate sub-problems from multiple candidates) and solving (which addresses the sub-problem). This implies authentic reasoning has an implicit multi-branch structure. Supervised fine-tuning collapses this rich structure into a flat sequence of token prediction in the teacher's reasoning path, preventing effective distillation of this structure to students. To address this limitation, we propose RLKD, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based distillation framework guided by a novel Generative Structure Reward Model (GSRM). Our GSRM converts reasoning paths into multiple meta-reasoning-solving steps and computes rewards to measure structural alignment between student and teacher reasoning. RLKD combines this reward with RL, enabling student LLMs to internalize the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure rather than merely mimicking fixed output paths. Experiments show RLKD surpasses standard SFT-RL pipelines even when trained on 0.1% of data under an RL-only regime, unlocking greater student reasoning potential than SFT-based distillation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies have applied large language models (LLMs) to machine translation quality estimation (MTQE) by prompting models to assign numeric scores. Nonetheless, these direct scoring methods tend to show low segment-level correlation with human judgments. In this paper, we propose a generation-based evaluation paradigm that leverages decoder-only LLMs to produce high-quality references, followed by semantic similarity scoring using sentence embeddings. We conduct the most extensive evaluation to date in MTQE, covering 8 LLMs and 8 language pairs. Empirical results show that our method outperforms both intra-LLM direct scoring baselines and external non-LLM reference-free metrics from MTME. These findings demonstrate the strength of generation-based evaluation and support a shift toward hybrid approaches that combine fluent generation with accurate semantic assessment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite LLMs' explicit alignment against demographic stereotypes, they have been shown to exhibit biases under various social contexts. In this work, we find that LLMs exhibit concerning biases in how they associate solution veracity with demographics. Through experiments across five human value-aligned LLMs on mathematics, coding, commonsense, and writing problems, we reveal two forms of such veracity biases: Attribution Bias, where models disproportionately attribute correct solutions to certain demographic groups, and Evaluation Bias, where models' assessment of identical solutions varies based on perceived demographic authorship. Our results show pervasive biases: LLMs consistently attribute fewer correct solutions and more incorrect ones to African-American groups in math and coding, while Asian authorships are least preferred in writing evaluation. In additional studies, we show LLMs automatically assign racially stereotypical colors to demographic groups in visualization code, suggesting these biases are deeply embedded in models' reasoning processes. Our findings indicate that demographic bias extends beyond surface-level stereotypes and social context provocations, raising concerns about LLMs' deployment in educational and evaluation settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce KoBALT (Korean Benchmark for Advanced Linguistic Tasks), a comprehensive linguistically-motivated benchmark comprising 700 multiple-choice questions spanning 24 phenomena across five linguistic domains: syntax, semantics, pragmatics, phonetics/phonology, and morphology. KoBALT is designed to advance the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in Korean, a morphologically rich language, by addressing the limitations of conventional benchmarks that often lack linguistic depth and typological grounding. It introduces a suite of expert-curated, linguistically motivated questions with minimal n-gram overlap with standard Korean corpora, substantially mitigating the risk of data contamination and allowing a more robust assessment of true language understanding. Our evaluation of 20 contemporary LLMs reveals significant performance disparities, with the highest-performing model achieving 61\% general accuracy but showing substantial variation across linguistic domains - from stronger performance in semantics (66\%) to considerable weaknesses in phonology (31\%) and morphology (36\%). Through human preference evaluation with 95 annotators, we demonstrate a strong correlation between KoBALT scores and human judgments, validating our benchmark's effectiveness as a discriminative measure of Korean language understanding. KoBALT addresses critical gaps in linguistic evaluation for typologically diverse languages and provides a robust framework for assessing genuine linguistic competence in Korean language models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent research in information extraction (IE) focuses on utilizing code-style inputs to enhance structured output generation. The intuition behind this is that the programming languages (PLs) inherently exhibit greater structural organization than natural languages (NLs). This structural advantage makes PLs particularly suited for IE tasks. Nevertheless, existing research primarily focuses on Python for code-style simulation, overlooking the potential of other widely-used PLs (e.g., C++ and Java) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase. In this research, we propose \textbf{M}ultiple \textbf{P}rogramming \textbf{L}anguages with large language models for information extraction (abbreviated as \textbf{MPL}), a novel framework that explores the potential of incorporating different PLs in the SFT phase. Additionally, we introduce \texttt{function-prompt} with virtual running to simulate code-style inputs more effectively and efficiently. Experimental results on a wide range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MPL. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis. We have released our code for future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While bariatric and metabolic surgery (MBS) is considered the gold standard treatment for severe and morbid obesity, its therapeutic efficacy hinges upon active and longitudinal engagement with multidisciplinary providers, including surgeons, dietitians/nutritionists, psychologists, and endocrinologists. This engagement spans the entire patient journey, from preoperative preparation to long-term postoperative management. However, this process is often hindered by numerous healthcare disparities, such as logistical and access barriers, which impair easy patient access to timely, evidence-based, clinician-endorsed information. To address these gaps, we introduce bRAGgen, a novel adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based model that autonomously integrates real-time medical evidence when response confidence dips below dynamic thresholds. This self-updating architecture ensures that responses remain current and accurate, reducing the risk of misinformation. Additionally, we present bRAGq, a curated dataset of 1,302 bariatric surgery--related questions, validated by an expert bariatric surgeon. bRAGq constitutes the first large-scale, domain-specific benchmark for comprehensive MBS care. In a two-phase evaluation, bRAGgen is benchmarked against state-of-the-art models using both large language model (LLM)--based metrics and expert surgeon review. Across all evaluation dimensions, bRAGgen demonstrates substantially superior performance in generating clinically accurate and relevant responses.

  _KMA Solaiman_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present BiasLab, a dataset of 300 political news articles annotated for perceived ideological bias. These articles were selected from a curated 900-document pool covering diverse political events and source biases. Each article is labeled by crowdworkers along two independent scales, assessing sentiment toward the Democratic and Republican parties, and enriched with rationale indicators. The annotation pipeline incorporates targeted worker qualification and was refined through pilot-phase analysis. We quantify inter-annotator agreement, analyze misalignment with source-level outlet bias, and organize the resulting labels into interpretable subsets. Additionally, we simulate annotation using schema-constrained GPT-4o, enabling direct comparison to human labels and revealing mirrored asymmetries, especially in misclassifying subtly right-leaning content. We define two modeling tasks: perception drift prediction and rationale type classification, and report baseline performance to illustrate the challenge of explainable bias detection. BiasLab's rich rationale annotations provide actionable interpretations that facilitate explainable modeling of political bias, supporting the development of transparent, socially aware NLP systems. We release the dataset, annotation schema, and modeling code to encourage research on human-in-the-loop interpretability and the evaluation of explanation effectiveness in real-world settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the emergence of ChatGPT, Transformer models have significantly advanced text classification and related tasks. Decoder-only models such as Llama exhibit strong performance and flexibility, yet they suffer from inefficiency on inference due to token-by-token generation, and their effectiveness in text classification tasks heavily depends on prompt quality. Moreover, their substantial GPU resource requirements often limit widespread adoption. Thus, the question of whether smaller language models are capable of effectively handling text classification tasks emerges as a topic of significant interest. However, the selection of appropriate models and methodologies remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning methods for transformer-based text classification. Specifically, we focus on practical industrial scenarios, including email classification, legal document categorization, and the classification of extremely long academic texts. We examine the strengths and limitations of smaller models, with particular attention to both their performance and their efficiency in Video Random-Access Memory (VRAM) utilization, thereby providing valuable insights for the local deployment and application of compact models in industrial settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative large language models present significant potential but also raise critical ethical concerns. Most studies focus on narrow ethical dimensions, and also limited diversity of languages and models. To address these gaps, we conduct a broad ethical evaluation of 29 recent open-source large language models using a novel data collection including four ethical aspects: Robustness, reliability, safety, and fairness. We analyze model behavior in both a commonly used language, English, and a low-resource language, Turkish. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive ethical assessment and guide safer model development by filling existing gaps in evaluation breadth, language coverage, and model diversity. Our experimental results, based on LLM-as-a-Judge, reveal that optimization efforts for many open-source models appear to have prioritized safety and fairness, and demonstrated good robustness while reliability remains a concern. We demonstrate that ethical evaluation can be effectively conducted independently of the language used. In addition, models with larger parameter counts tend to exhibit better ethical performance, with Gemma and Qwen models demonstrating the most ethical behavior among those evaluated.

  _Yash Saxena, Anpur Padia, Mandar S Chaudhary, Kalpa Gunaratna, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, Manas Gaur_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines rely on similarity-based retrieval and re-ranking, which depend on heuristics such as top-k, and lack explainability, interpretability, and robustness against adversarial content. To address this gap, we propose a novel method METEORA that replaces re-ranking in RAG with a rationale-driven selection approach. METEORA operates in two stages. First, a general-purpose LLM is preference-tuned to generate rationales conditioned on the input query using direct preference optimization. These rationales guide the evidence chunk selection engine, which selects relevant chunks in three stages: pairing individual rationales with corresponding retrieved chunks for local relevance, global selection with elbow detection for adaptive cutoff, and context expansion via neighboring chunks. This process eliminates the need for top-k heuristics. The rationales are also used for consistency check using a Verifier LLM to detect and filter poisoned or misleading content for safe generation. The framework provides explainable and interpretable evidence flow by using rationales consistently across both selection and verification. Our evaluation across six datasets spanning legal, financial, and academic research domains shows that METEORA improves generation accuracy by 33.34% while using approximately 50% fewer chunks than state-of-the-art re-ranking methods. In adversarial settings, METEORA significantly improves the F1 score from 0.10 to 0.44 over the state-of-the-art perplexity-based defense baseline, demonstrating strong resilience to poisoning attacks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in human-AI collaborative decision-making hinges on their ability to provide trustworthy, gradual, and tailored explanations. Solving complex puzzles, such as Sudoku, offers a canonical example of this collaboration, where clear and customized explanations often hold greater importance than the final solution. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five LLMs in solving and explaining \sixsix{} Sudoku puzzles. While one LLM demonstrates limited success in solving puzzles, none can explain the solution process in a manner that reflects strategic reasoning or intuitive problem-solving. These findings underscore significant challenges that must be addressed before LLMs can become effective partners in human-AI collaborative decision-making.

  Process Reward Models (PRMs), which provide step-by-step feedback on the reasoning generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), are receiving increasing attention. However, two key research gaps remain: collecting accurate step-level error labels for training typically requires costly human annotation, and existing PRMs are limited to math reasoning problems. In response to these gaps, this paper aims to address the challenges of automatic dataset creation and the generalization of PRMs to diverse reasoning tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose FoVer, an approach for training PRMs on step-level error labels automatically annotated by formal verification tools, such as Z3 for formal logic and Isabelle for theorem proof, which provide automatic and accurate verification for symbolic tasks. Using this approach, we synthesize a training dataset with error labels on LLM responses for formal logic and theorem proof tasks without human annotation. Although this data synthesis is feasible only for tasks compatible with formal verification, we observe that LLM-based PRMs trained on our dataset exhibit cross-task generalization, improving verification across diverse reasoning tasks. Specifically, PRMs trained with FoVer significantly outperform baseline PRMs based on the original LLMs and achieve competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art PRMs trained on labels annotated by humans or stronger models, as measured by step-level verification on ProcessBench and Best-of-K performance across 12 reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME, ANLI, MMLU, and BBH. The datasets, models, and code are provided atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a large language model based reward decomposition framework for aligning dialogue agents using only a single session-level feedback signal. We leverage the reasoning capabilities of a frozen, pretrained large language model (LLM) to infer fine-grained local implicit rewards by decomposing global, session-level feedback. Our first text-only variant prompts the LLM to perform reward decomposition using only the dialogue transcript. The second multimodal variant incorporates additional behavioral cues, such as pitch, gaze, and facial affect, expressed as natural language descriptions. These inferred turn-level rewards are distilled into a lightweight reward model, which we utilize for RL-based fine-tuning for dialogue generation. We evaluate both text-only and multimodal variants against state-of-the-art reward decomposition methods and demonstrate notable improvements in human evaluations of conversation quality, suggesting that LLMs are strong reward decomposers that obviate the need for manual reward shaping and granular human feedback.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in diverse reasoning tasks, yet their application to complex physics reasoning remains underexplored. Physics reasoning presents unique challenges, requiring grounding in physical conditions and the interpretation of multimodal information. Current physics benchmarks are limited, often focusing on text-only inputs or solely on problem-solving, thereby overlooking the critical intermediate steps of variable identification and process formulation. To address these limitations, we introduce PhysicsArena, the first multimodal physics reasoning benchmark designed to holistically evaluate MLLMs across three critical dimensions: variable identification, physical process formulation, and solution derivation. PhysicsArena aims to provide a comprehensive platform for assessing and advancing the multimodal physics reasoning abilities of MLLMs.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly advance, we introduce Hunyuan-TurboS, a novel large hybrid Transformer-Mamba Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. It synergistically combines Mamba's long-sequence processing efficiency with Transformer's superior contextual understanding. Hunyuan-TurboS features an adaptive long-short chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism, dynamically switching between rapid responses for simple queries and deep "thinking" modes for complex problems, optimizing computational resources. Architecturally, this 56B activated (560B total) parameter model employs 128 layers (Mamba2, Attention, FFN) with an innovative AMF/MF block pattern. Faster Mamba2 ensures linear complexity, Grouped-Query Attention minimizes KV cache, and FFNs use an MoE structure. Pre-trained on 16T high-quality tokens, it supports a 256K context length and is the first industry-deployed large-scale Mamba model. Our comprehensive post-training strategy enhances capabilities via Supervised Fine-Tuning (3M instructions), a novel Adaptive Long-short CoT Fusion method, Multi-round Deliberation Learning for iterative improvement, and a two-stage Large-scale Reinforcement Learning process targeting STEM and general instruction-following. Evaluations show strong performance: overall top 7 rank on LMSYS Chatbot Arena with a score of 1356, outperforming leading models like Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 (1352) and o4-mini-2025-04-16 (1345). TurboS also achieves an average of 77.9% across 23 automated benchmarks. Hunyuan-TurboS balances high performance and efficiency, offering substantial capabilities at lower inference costs than many reasoning models, establishing a new paradigm for efficient large-scale pre-trained models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mental manipulation is a subtle yet pervasive form of psychological abuse that poses serious threats to mental health. Its covert nature and the complexity of manipulation strategies make it challenging to detect, even for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). This concealment also hinders the manual collection of large-scale, high-quality annotations essential for training effective models. Although recent efforts have sought to improve LLMs' performance on this task, progress remains limited due to the scarcity of real-world annotated datasets. To address these challenges, we propose MentalMAC, a multi-task anti-curriculum distillation method that enhances LLMs' ability to detect mental manipulation in multi-turn dialogue. Our approach includes: (i) EvoSA, an unsupervised data expansion method based on evolutionary operations and speech act theory; (ii) teacher model-generated multi-task supervision; and (iii) progressive knowledge distillation from complex to simpler tasks. We then constructed the ReaMent dataset with 5,000 real-world dialogue samples, using a MentalMAC-distilled model to assist human annotation. Vast experiments demonstrate that our method significantly narrows the gap between student and teacher models and outperforms competitive LLMs across key evaluation metrics. All code, datasets, and checkpoints will be released upon paper acceptance. Warning: This paper contains content that may be offensive to readers.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Particularly, the "Zero" reinforcement learning introduced by Deepseek-R1-Zero, enables direct RL training of base LLMs without relying on an intermediate supervised fine-tuning stage. Despite these advancements, current works for LLM reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data abundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce. In this paper, we propose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Our key contributions include: (1) constructing a large-scale, high-quality dataset of questions with verifiable answers curated by web crawling, covering a wide range of disciplines; and (2) developing a generative model-based answer verifier, which replaces traditional rule-based verification with the capability of chain-of-thought and context-awareness. We train a series of models and evaluate them on a wide range of datasets covering wide domains like physics, chemistry, finance, electronics etc. Our comprehensive evaluation across these 12 benchmarks (e.g. MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, TheoremQA, BBEH and MATH AMC) demonstrates that General-Reasoner outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving robust and generalizable reasoning performance while maintaining superior effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language model (LLM) based agents have shown great potential in following human instructions and automatically completing various tasks. To complete a task, the agent needs to decompose it into easily executed steps by planning. Existing studies mainly conduct the planning by inferring what steps should be executed next starting from the agent's initial state. However, this forward reasoning paradigm doesn't work well for complex tasks. We propose to study this issue in Minecraft, a virtual environment that simulates complex tasks based on real-world scenarios. We believe that the failure of forward reasoning is caused by the big perception gap between the agent's initial state and task goal. To this end, we leverage backward reasoning and make the planning starting from the terminal state, which can directly achieve the task goal in one step. Specifically, we design a BAckward Reasoning based agent (BAR). It is equipped with a recursive goal decomposition module, a state consistency maintaining module and a stage memory module to make robust, consistent, and efficient planning starting from the terminal state. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of BAR over existing methods and the effectiveness of proposed modules.

  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on task-specific data is essential for their effective deployment. As dataset sizes grow, efficiently selecting optimal subsets for training becomes crucial to balancing performance and computational costs. Traditional data selection methods often require fine-tuning a scoring model on the target dataset, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive, or rely on heuristics that fail to fully leverage the model's predictive capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Data Whisperer, an efficient, training-free, attention-based method that leverages few-shot in-context learning with the model to be fine-tuned. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted on both raw and synthetic datasets across diverse tasks and models. Notably, Data Whisperer achieves superior performance compared to the full GSM8K dataset on the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, using just 10% of the data, and outperforms existing methods with a 3.1-point improvement and a 7.4$\times$ speedup.

  Optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) performance requires well-crafted prompts, but manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and often ineffective. Automated prompt optimization techniques address this challenge but the majority of them rely on randomly selected evaluation subsets, which fail to represent the full dataset, leading to unreliable evaluations and suboptimal prompts. Existing coreset selection methods, designed for LLM benchmarking, are unsuitable for prompt optimization due to challenges in clustering similar samples, high data collection costs, and the unavailability of performance data for new or private datasets. To overcome these issues, we propose IPOMP, an Iterative evaluation data selection for effective Prompt Optimization using real-time Model Performance. IPOMP is a two-stage approach that selects representative and diverse samples using semantic clustering and boundary analysis, followed by iterative refinement with real-time model performance data to replace redundant samples. Evaluations on the BIG-bench dataset show that IPOMP improves effectiveness by 1.6% to 5.3% and stability by at least 57% compared with SOTA baselines, with minimal computational overhead below 1%. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that our real-time performance-guided refinement approach can be universally applied to enhance existing coreset selection methods.

  Large language models (LLMs) are sensitive to subtle changes in prompt phrasing, complicating efforts to audit them reliably. Prior approaches often rely on arbitrary or ungrounded prompt variations, which may miss key linguistic and demographic factors in real-world usage. We introduce AUGMENT (Automated User-Grounded Modeling and Evaluation of Natural Language Transformations), a framework for systematically generating and evaluating controlled, realistic prompt paraphrases based on linguistic structure and user demographics. AUGMENT ensures paraphrase quality through a combination of semantic, stylistic, and instruction-following criteria. In a case study on the BBQ dataset, we show that user-grounded paraphrasing leads to significant shifts in LLM performance and bias metrics across nine models. Our findings highlight the need for more representative and structured approaches to prompt variation in LLM auditing.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, it is essential to assess how they perform on established benchmarks. In this study, we present a suite of experiments to assess the performance of modern LLMs (ranging from 3B to 90B+ parameters) on CaseHOLD, a legal benchmark dataset for identifying case holdings. Our experiments demonstrate ``scaling effects'' - performance on this task improves with model size, with more capable models like GPT4o and AmazonNovaPro achieving macro F1 scores of 0.744 and 0.720 respectively. These scores are competitive with the best published results on this dataset, and do not require any technically sophisticated model training, fine-tuning or few-shot prompting. To ensure that these strong results are not due to memorization of judicial opinions contained in the training data, we develop and utilize a novel citation anonymization test that preserves semantic meaning while ensuring case names and citations are fictitious. Models maintain strong performance under these conditions (macro F1 of 0.728), suggesting the performance is not due to rote memorization. These findings demonstrate both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for legal tasks with important implications for the development and measurement of automated legal analytics and legal benchmarks.

  Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in formal theorem proving, yet existing benchmarks remain limited to isolated, static proof tasks, failing to capture the iterative, engineering-intensive workflows of real-world formal mathematics libraries. Motivated by analogous advances in software engineering, we introduce the paradigm of Automated Proof Engineering (APE), which aims to automate proof engineering tasks such as feature addition, proof refactoring, and bug fixing using LLMs. To facilitate research in this direction, we present APE-Bench I, the first realistic benchmark built from real-world commit histories of Mathlib4, featuring diverse file-level tasks described in natural language and verified via a hybrid approach combining the Lean compiler and LLM-as-a-Judge. We further develop Eleanstic, a scalable parallel verification infrastructure optimized for proof checking across multiple versions of Mathlib. Empirical results on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate strong performance on localized edits but substantial degradation on handling complex proof engineering. This work lays the foundation for developing agentic workflows in proof engineering, with future benchmarks targeting multi-file coordination, project-scale verification, and autonomous agents capable of planning, editing, and repairing formal libraries.

  Distillation has shown remarkable success in transferring knowledge from a Large Language Model (LLM) teacher to a student LLM. However, current distillation methods require similar tokenizers between the teacher and the student, restricting their applicability to only a small subset of teacher-student pairs. In this work, we develop a principled cross-tokenizer distillation method to solve this crucial deficiency. Our method is the first to enable effective distillation across fundamentally different tokenizers, while also substantially outperforming prior methods in all other cases. We verify the efficacy of our method on three distinct use cases. First, we show that viewing tokenizer transfer as self-distillation enables unprecedentedly effective transfer across tokenizers, including rapid transfer of subword models to the byte-level. Transferring different models to the same tokenizer also enables ensembling to boost performance. Secondly, we distil a large maths-specialised LLM into a small general-purpose model with a different tokenizer, achieving competitive maths problem-solving performance. Thirdly, we use our method to train state-of-the-art embedding prediction hypernetworks for training-free tokenizer transfer. Our results unlock an expanded range of teacher-student pairs for distillation, enabling new ways to adapt and enhance interaction between LLMs.

Our evaluation shows that current MLLMs face fundamental challenges in vision-language alignment and domain adaptation, highlighting a critical gap in current benchmarks. By providing a scalable and rigorous framework, DomainCQA enables more precise assessment and improvement of MLLMs for domain-specific applications.

In this study, we assess media bias in LLM-generated content and LLMs' ability to detect subtle ideological bias. We conduct this evaluation using two datasets, PoliGen and EconoLex, covering political and economic discourse, respectively. We evaluate seven widely used LLMs by prompting them to generate articles and analyze their ideological preferences via Socratic probing. By using our self-contained Socratic approach, the study aims to directly measure the models' biases rather than relying on external interpretations, thereby minimizing subjective judgments about media bias. Our results reveal a consistent preference of Democratic over Republican positions across all models. Conversely, in economic topics, biases vary among Western LLMs, while those developed in China lean more strongly toward socialism.

  Academic paper review is a critical yet time-consuming task within the research community. With the increasing volume of academic publications, automating the review process has become a significant challenge. The primary issue lies in generating comprehensive, accurate, and reasoning-consistent review comments that align with human reviewers' judgments. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing ReviewAgents, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate academic paper reviews. We first introduce a novel dataset, Review-CoT, consisting of 142k review comments, designed for training LLM agents. This dataset emulates the structured reasoning process of human reviewers-summarizing the paper, referencing relevant works, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and generating a review conclusion. Building upon this, we train LLM reviewer agents capable of structured reasoning using a relevant-paper-aware training method. Furthermore, we construct ReviewAgents, a multi-role, multi-LLM agent review framework, to enhance the review comment generation process. Additionally, we propose ReviewBench, a benchmark for evaluating the review comments generated by LLMs. Our experimental results on ReviewBench demonstrate that while existing LLMs exhibit a certain degree of potential for automating the review process, there remains a gap when compared to human-generated reviews. Moreover, our ReviewAgents framework further narrows this gap, outperforming advanced LLMs in generating review comments.

  Multi-step reasoning is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet multilingual performance remains challenging. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning, it struggles with non-English languages due to the entanglement of reasoning and execution. Program-of-Thought (PoT) prompting separates reasoning from execution, offering a promising alternative but shifting the challenge to generating programs from non-English questions. We propose a framework to evaluate PoT by separating multilingual reasoning from code execution to examine (i) the impact of fine-tuning on question-reasoning alignment and (ii) how reasoning quality affects answer correctness. Our findings demonstrate that PoT fine-tuning substantially enhances multilingual reasoning, outperforming CoT fine-tuned models. We further demonstrate a strong correlation between reasoning quality (measured through code quality) and answer accuracy, highlighting its potential as a test-time performance improvement heuristic.

  Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. One key concept in spatial cognition is the Frame of Reference (FoR), which identifies the perspective of spatial expressions. Despite its significance, FoR has received limited attention in AI models that need spatial intelligence. There is a lack of dedicated benchmarks and in-depth evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in this area. To address this issue, we introduce the Frame of Reference Evaluation in Spatial Reasoning Tasks (FoREST) benchmark, designed to assess FoR comprehension in LLMs. We evaluate LLMs on answering questions that require FoR comprehension and layout generation in text-to-image models using FoREST. Our results reveal a notable performance gap across different FoR classes in various LLMs, affecting their ability to generate accurate layouts for text-to-image generation. This highlights critical shortcomings in FoR comprehension. To improve FoR understanding, we propose Spatial-Guided prompting, which improves LLMs ability to extract essential spatial concepts. Our proposed method improves overall performance across spatial reasoning tasks.

  _Jingbo Yang, Bairu Hou, Wei Wei, Yujia Bao, Shiyu Chang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We describe KVLink, an approach for efficient key-value (KV) cache reuse in large language models (LLMs). In many LLM applications, different inputs can share overlapping context, such as the same retrieved document appearing in multiple queries. However, the LLMs still need to encode the entire context for each query, leading to redundant computation. In this paper, we investigate a new strategy to eliminate such inefficiency, where the KV cache of each document is precomputed independently. During inference, the KV caches of retrieved documents are concatenated, allowing the model to reuse cached representations instead of recomputing them. To mitigate the performance degradation when using KV caches computed independently for each document, KVLink introduces two key techniques: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV cache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, and using trainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded documents. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that KVLink improves question answering accuracy by an average of 4% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, by leveraging precomputed KV caches, our approach reduces time-to-first-token by up to 96% compared to standard LLM inference, making it a scalable and efficient solution for context reuse. Additionally, KVLink can be combined with KV cache compression to further save cache loading and storage overhead while outperforming the baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications requires robust safety guard models to detect and block harmful user prompts. While large safety guard models achieve strong performance, their computational cost is substantial. To mitigate this, smaller distilled models are used, but they often underperform on "hard" examples where the larger model provides accurate predictions. We observe that many inputs can be reliably handled by the smaller model, while only a small fraction require the larger model's capacity. Motivated by this, we propose SafeRoute, a binary router that distinguishes hard examples from easy ones. Our method selectively applies the larger safety guard model to the data that the router considers hard, improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy compared to solely using the larger safety guard model. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our adaptive model selection significantly enhances the trade-off between computational cost and safety performance, outperforming relevant baselines.

  Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a crucial task in information extraction and sentiment analysis, aiming to identify aspects with associated sentiment elements in text. However, existing ABSA datasets are predominantly English-centric, limiting the scope for multilingual evaluation and research. To bridge this gap, we present M-ABSA, a comprehensive dataset spanning 7 domains and 21 languages, making it the most extensive multilingual parallel dataset for ABSA to date. Our primary focus is on triplet extraction, which involves identifying aspect terms, aspect categories, and sentiment polarities. The dataset is constructed through an automatic translation process with human review to ensure quality. We perform extensive experiments using various baselines to assess performance and compatibility on M-ABSA. Our empirical findings highlight that the dataset enables diverse evaluation tasks, such as multilingual and multi-domain transfer learning, and large language model evaluation, underscoring its inclusivity and its potential to drive advancements in multilingual ABSA research.

  Retrieved documents containing noise will hinder Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from detecting answer clues, necessitating noise filtering mechanisms to enhance accuracy. Existing methods use reranking or summarization to identify the most relevant sentences, but directly and accurately locating answer clues from these large-scale and complex documents remains challenging. Unlike these document-level operations, we treat noise filtering as a sentence-level MinMax optimization problem: first identifying potential clues from multiple documents, then ranking them by relevance, and finally retaining the minimum number of clues through truncation. In this paper, we propose FineFilter, a novel fine-grained noise filtering mechanism for RAG, consisting of a clue extractor, a reranker, and a truncator. We optimize each module to tackle complex reasoning challenges: (1) The clue extractor first uses sentences containing the answer and similar ones as fine-tuning targets, aiming to extract sufficient potential clues; (2) The reranker is trained to prioritize effective clues based on the real feedback from the generation module, with clues capable of generating correct answers as positive samples and others as negative; (3) The truncator takes the minimum number of clues needed to answer the question (truncation point) as fine-tuning targets, and performs truncation on the reranked clues to achieve fine-grained noise filtering. Experiments on three QA datasets demonstrate that FineFilter significantly improves QA performance over baselines on both LLaMA3 and Mistral. Further analysis confirms its effectiveness in complex reasoning, robustness to unreliable retrieval, and generalization to different scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-SQL aims to convert natural language questions into executable SQL queries. While previous approaches, such as skeleton-masked selection, have demonstrated strong performance by retrieving similar training examples to guide large language models (LLMs), they struggle in real-world scenarios where such examples are unavailable. To overcome this limitation, we propose Self-Augmentation in-context learning with Fine-grained Example selection for Text-to-SQL (SAFE-SQL), a novel framework that improves SQL generation by generating and filtering self-augmented examples. SAFE-SQL first prompts an LLM to generate multiple Text-to-SQL examples relevant to the test input. Then SAFE-SQL filters these examples through three relevance assessments, constructing high-quality in-context learning examples. Using self-generated examples, SAFE-SQL surpasses the previous zero-shot, and few-shot Text-to-SQL frameworks, achieving higher execution accuracy. Notably, our approach provides additional performance gains in extra hard and unseen scenarios, where conventional methods often fail.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models (LLMs) excel in generating coherent and contextually rich outputs, their capacity to efficiently handle long-form contexts is limited by fixed-length position embeddings. Additionally, the computational cost of processing long sequences increases quadratically, making it challenging to extend context length. To address these challenges, we propose Long-form Context Injection with Recurrent Compression (LCIRC), a method that enables the efficient processing long-form sequences beyond the model's length limit through recurrent compression without retraining the entire model. We further introduce query dependent context modeling, which selectively compresses query-relevant information, ensuring that the model retains the most pertinent content. Our empirical results demonstrate that Query Dependent LCIRC (QD-LCIRC) significantly improves LLM's ability to manage extended contexts, making it well-suited for tasks that require both comprehensive context understanding and query relevance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conceptual combination is a cognitive process that merges basic concepts, enabling the creation of complex expressions. During this process, the properties of combination (e.g., the whiteness of a peeled apple) can be inherited from basic concepts, newly emerge, or be canceled. However, previous studies have evaluated a limited set of properties and have not examined the generative process. To address this gap, we introduce the Conceptual Combination with Property Type dataset (CCPT), which consists of 12.3K annotated triplets of noun phrases, properties, and property types. Using CCPT, we establish three types of tasks to evaluate LLMs for conceptual combination thoroughly. Our key findings are threefold: (1) Our automatic metric grading property emergence and cancellation closely corresponds with human judgments. (2) LLMs, including OpenAI's o1, struggle to generate noun phrases which possess given emergent properties. (3) Our proposed method, inspired by cognitive psychology model that explains how relationships between concepts are formed, improves performances in all generative tasks.

  Selecting high-quality data can improve the pretraining efficiency of large language models (LLMs). Existing methods generally rely on heuristic techniques or single quality signals, limiting their ability to evaluate data quality comprehensively. In this work, we propose FIRE, a flexible and scalable framework for integrating multiple data quality raters, which allows for a comprehensive assessment of data quality across various dimensions. FIRE aligns multiple quality signals into a unified space, and integrates diverse data quality raters to provide a comprehensive quality signal for each data point. Further, we introduce a progressive data selection scheme based on FIRE that iteratively refines the selection of high-quality data points. Extensive experiments show that FIRE outperforms other data selection methods and significantly boosts pretrained model performance across a wide range of downstream tasks, while requiring less than 37.5\% of the training data needed by the Random baseline to reach the target performance.

  We present ReFoRCE, a Text-to-SQL agent that tops the Spider 2.0 leaderboard--a challenging benchmark reflecting complex, real-world Text-to-SQL scenarios. While Text-to-SQL systems enable natural language queries over structured databases, deploying them in enterprise environments remains difficult due to large, complex schemas (with over 1,000 columns), diverse SQL dialects (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake), and sophisticated query requirements (e.g., transformations and analytics). ReFoRCE addresses these challenges through: (a) database information compression via pattern-based table grouping and LLM-guided schema linking to alleviate long-context issues; (b) self-refinement to iteratively correct syntax and semantic errors across dialects; (c) majority-vote consensus to select high-confidence candidates while deferring ambiguous cases arising from sophisticated queries; and (d) iterative column exploration guided by execution feedback to resolve those deferred cases. ReFoRCE achieves new state-of-the-art results, with scores of 35.83 on Spider 2.0-Snow and 36.56 on Spider 2.0-Lite.

  Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in various fields of society due to their powerful reasoning, understanding, and generation capabilities. However, the security issues associated with these models are becoming increasingly severe. Jailbreaking attacks, as an important method for detecting vulnerabilities in LLMs, have been explored by researchers who attempt to induce these models to generate harmful content through various attack methods. Nevertheless, existing jailbreaking methods face numerous limitations, such as excessive query counts, limited coverage of jailbreak modalities, low attack success rates, and simplistic evaluation methods. To overcome these constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal jailbreaking method: JMLLM. This method integrates multiple strategies to perform comprehensive jailbreak attacks across text, visual, and auditory modalities. Additionally, we contribute a new and comprehensive dataset for multimodal jailbreaking research: TriJail, which includes jailbreak prompts for all three modalities. Experiments on the TriJail dataset and the benchmark dataset AdvBench, conducted on 13 popular LLMs, demonstrate advanced attack success rates and significant reduction in time overhead.

  The subtlety of emotional expressions makes implicit emotion analysis (IEA) particularly sensitive to user-specific characteristics. Current studies personalize emotion analysis by focusing on the author but neglect the impact of the intended reader on implicit emotional feedback. In this paper, we introduce Personalized IEA (PIEA) and present the RAPPIE model, which addresses subjective variability by incorporating reader feedback. In particular, (1) we create reader agents based on large language models to simulate reader feedback, overcoming the issue of ``spiral of silence effect'' and data incompleteness of real reader reaction. (2) We develop a role-aware multi-view graph learning to model the emotion interactive propagation process in scenarios with sparse reader information. (3) We construct two new PIEA datasets covering English and Chinese social media with detailed user metadata, addressing the text-centric limitation of existing datasets. Extensive experiments show that RAPPIE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of incorporating reader feedback in PIEA.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a variety of tasks in different domains. However, they sometimes generate responses that are logically coherent but factually incorrect or misleading, which is known as LLM hallucinations. Data-driven supervised methods train hallucination detectors by leveraging the internal states of LLMs, but detectors trained on specific domains often struggle to generalize well to other domains. In this paper, we aim to enhance the cross-domain performance of supervised detectors with only in-domain data. We propose a novel framework, prompt-guided internal states for hallucination detection of LLMs, namely PRISM. By utilizing appropriate prompts to guide changes to the structure related to text truthfulness in LLMs' internal states, we make this structure more salient and consistent across texts from different domains. We integrated our framework with existing hallucination detection methods and conducted experiments on datasets from different domains. The experimental results indicate that our framework significantly enhances the cross-domain generalization of existing hallucination detection methods.

  Numerous studies have assessed the proficiency of AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), in facilitating everyday tasks such as email writing, question answering, and creative content generation. However, researchers face unique challenges and opportunities in leveraging LLMs for their own work, such as brainstorming research ideas, designing experiments, and writing or reviewing papers. In this study, we introduce AAAR-1.0, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate LLM performance in three fundamental, expertise-intensive research tasks: (i) EquationInference, assessing the correctness of equations based on the contextual information in paper submissions; (ii) ExperimentDesign, designing experiments to validate research ideas and solutions; (iii) PaperWeakness, identifying weaknesses in paper submissions; and (iv) REVIEWCRITIQUE, identifying each segment in human reviews is deficient or not. AAAR-1.0 differs from prior benchmarks in two key ways: first, it is explicitly research-oriented, with tasks requiring deep domain expertise; second, it is researcher-oriented, mirroring the primary activities that researchers engage in on a daily basis. An evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LLMs reveals their potential as well as limitations in conducting sophisticated research tasks. We will keep iterating AAAR-1.0 to new versions.

  Long-context LLMs are increasingly in demand for applications such as retrieval-augmented generation. To defray the cost of pretraining LLMs over long contexts, recent work takes an approach of synthetic context extension: fine-tuning LLMs with synthetically generated long-context data in a post-training stage. However, it remains unclear how and why this synthetic context extension imparts abilities for downstream long-context tasks. In this paper, we investigate fine-tuning on synthetic data for three long-context tasks that require retrieval and reasoning. We vary the realism of "needle" concepts to be retrieved and diversity of the surrounding "haystack" context, from using LLMs to construct synthetic documents to using templated relations and creating symbolic datasets. We find that models trained on synthetic data fall short of the real data, but surprisingly, the mismatch can be interpreted and even predicted in terms of a special set of attention heads that are responsible for retrieval over long context, retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2024). The retrieval heads learned on synthetic data have high overlap with retrieval heads learned on real data, and there is a strong correlation between the recall of heads learned and the downstream performance of a model. Furthermore, with attention knockout and activation patching, we mechanistically show that retrieval heads are necessary and explain model performance, although they are not totally sufficient. Our results shed light on how to interpret synthetic data fine-tuning performance and how to approach creating better data for learning real-world capabilities over long contexts.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The availability of a wide range of large language models (LLMs) embedded in various agentic systems has significantly increased the potential of model selection strategies to improve the cost-performance tradeoff. Existing strategies involve either routing, where a single model is chosen per query, or cascading, which sequentially runs increasingly larger models until a satisfactory answer is found. However, current approaches face three key limitations: they (1) lack formal proofs of optimality, (2) fail to identify the conditions under which these strategies are most effective to improve the cost-performance tradeoff, and (3) are unable to combine both paradigms for further improvements. To address these issues, we first derive a novel optimal strategy for cascading and prove the optimality of an existing routing strategy. Further, we propose cascade routing, a unified framework that integrates routing and cascading into a theoretically optimal strategy. Through our analysis, we identify good quality estimators as the critical factor for the success of model selection paradigms. Finally, in our experiments, we show that cascade routing consistently outperforms the individual approaches by a large margin and we analyze quality estimators to determine when routing and/or cascading are useful paradigms for model selection.

  Large language models (LLMs) struggle with maintaining accurate knowledge due to conflicting/outdated parametric memories. While locate-and-edit methods address this, their reliance on models' internal representations leads to robustness failures in long-context reasoning and paraphrased queries. We identify a fundamental limitation of locate-and-edit methods: existing semantic keys (for memory localization) cannot simultaneously satisfy robustness (context-invariant activation) and specificity (precise knowledge discrimination). Through theoretical error-bound analysis, we establish formal criteria for effective editing. Our solution introduces \textit{Robust Edit Pathway (REP)}, a plug-and-play module that: (1) disentangles editing keys from native model representations; (2) dynamically adjusts keys via contrastive learning to achieve robustness-specificity balance. Extensive experiments across various editing methods (ROME/MEMIT/R-ROME/EMMET), existing LLMs (LLaMA2, QWen, Mistral), and datasets (CounterFact, ZsRE) show that REP improves success rate over robustness tests by up-to 66.4\% while maintaining the success rate unaffected.

  With the rapid growth in the size and complexity of large language models (LLMs), the costs associated with their training and inference have escalated significantly. Research indicates that certain layers in LLMs harbor substantial redundancy, and pruning these layers has minimal impact on the overall performance. While various layer pruning methods have been developed based on this insight, they generally overlook the finer-grained redundancies within the layers themselves. In this paper, we delve deeper into the architecture of LLMs and demonstrate that finer-grained pruning can be achieved by targeting redundancies in multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) blocks. We propose a novel, training-free structured pruning approach called BlockPruner. Unlike existing layer pruning methods, BlockPruner segments each Transformer layer into MHA and MLP blocks. It then assesses the importance of these blocks using perplexity measures and applies a heuristic search for iterative pruning. We applied BlockPruner to LLMs of various sizes and architectures and validated its performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. Experimental results show that BlockPruner achieves more granular and effective pruning compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

  Entity Linking in natural language processing seeks to match text entities to their corresponding entries in a dictionary or knowledge base. Traditional approaches rely on contextual models, which can be complex, hard to train, and have limited transferability across different domains. Generative large language models like GPT offer a promising alternative but often underperform with naive prompts. In this study, we introduce EntGPT, employing advanced prompt engineering to enhance EL tasks. Our three-step hard-prompting method (EntGPT-P) significantly boosts the micro-F_1 score by up to 36% over vanilla prompts, achieving competitive performance across 10 datasets without supervised fine-tuning. Additionally, our instruction tuning method (EntGPT-I) improves micro-F_1 scores by 2.1% on average in supervised EL tasks and outperforms several baseline models in six Question Answering tasks. Our methods are compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. All data and code are available on GitHub atthis https URL.

  In the large language model (LLM) revolution, embedding is a key component of various systems, such as retrieving knowledge or memories for LLMs or building content moderation filters. As such cases span from English to other natural or programming languages, from retrieval to classification and beyond, it is advantageous to build a unified embedding model rather than dedicated ones for each scenario. In this context, the pre-trained multilingual decoder-only large language models, e.g., BLOOM, emerge as a viable backbone option. To assess their potential, we propose straightforward strategies for constructing embedders and introduce a universal evaluation benchmark. Experimental results show that our trained model is proficient at generating good embeddings across languages and tasks, even extending to languages and tasks for which no finetuning/pretraining data is available. We also present detailed analyses and additional evaluations. We hope that this work could encourage the development of more robust open-source universal embedders.

  We introduce $\infty$-THOR, a new framework for long-horizon embodied tasks that advances long-context understanding in embodied AI. $\infty$-THOR provides: (1) a generation framework for synthesizing scalable, reproducible, and unlimited long-horizon trajectories; (2) a novel embodied QA task, Needle(s) in the Embodied Haystack, where multiple scattered clues across extended trajectories test agents' long-context reasoning ability; and (3) a long-horizon dataset and benchmark suite featuring complex tasks that span hundreds of environment steps, each paired with ground-truth action sequences. To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions. Our work provides a foundation for the next generation of embodied AI systems capable of robust, long-term reasoning and planning.

  Existing reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) frequently fail to capture authentic creativity, often rewarding memorization of previously observed patterns. We address this shortcoming with Sudoku-Bench, a curated benchmark of challenging and unconventional Sudoku variants specifically selected to evaluate creative, multi-step logical reasoning. Sudoku variants form an unusually effective domain for reasoning research: each puzzle introduces unique or subtly interacting constraints, making memorization infeasible and requiring solvers to identify novel logical breakthroughs (``break-ins''). Despite their diversity, Sudoku variants maintain a common and compact structure, enabling clear and consistent evaluation. Sudoku-Bench includes a carefully chosen puzzle set, a standardized text-based puzzle representation, and flexible tools compatible with thousands of publicly available puzzles -- making it easy to extend into a general research environment. Baseline experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs solve fewer than 15\% of puzzles unaided, highlighting significant opportunities to advance long-horizon, strategic reasoning capabilities.

  Learning how the world works is central to building AI agents that can adapt to complex environments. Traditional world models based on deep learning demand vast amounts of training data, and do not flexibly update their knowledge from sparse observations. Recent advances in program synthesis using Large Language Models (LLMs) give an alternate approach which learns world models represented as source code, supporting strong generalization from little data. To date, application of program-structured world models remains limited to natural language and grid-world domains. We introduce a novel program synthesis method for effectively modeling complex, non-gridworld domains by representing a world model as an exponentially-weighted product of programmatic experts (PoE-World) synthesized by LLMs. We show that this approach can learn complex, stochastic world models from just a few observations. We evaluate the learned world models by embedding them in a model-based planning agent, demonstrating efficient performance and generalization to unseen levels on Atari's Pong and Montezuma's Revenge. We release our code and display the learned world models and videos of the agent's gameplay atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on prolonged reasoning chains to solve complex tasks. However, this trial-and-error approach often leads to high computational overhead and error propagation, where early mistakes can derail subsequent steps. To address these issues, we introduce Meta-Reasoner, a framework that dynamically optimizes inference-time reasoning by enabling LLMs to \enquote{think about how to think.} Drawing inspiration from human meta-cognition and dual-process theory, Meta-Reasoner operates as a strategic advisor, decoupling high-level guidance from step-by-step generation. It employs contextual multi-armed bandits to iteratively evaluate reasoning progress and select optimal strategies (e.g., backtrack, clarify ambiguity, restart from scratch, or propose alternative approaches), and reallocates computational resources toward the most promising paths. Our evaluations on mathematical reasoning and puzzles highlight the potential of dynamic reasoning chains to overcome inherent challenges in the LLM reasoning process and also show promise in broader applications, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for reasoning-intensive tasks.

  While chains-of-thought (CoT) have advanced complex reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), existing methods remain confined to text or static visual domains, often faltering in dynamic spatial reasoning tasks. To bridge this gap, we present GRASSLAND, a novel maze navigation benchmark designed to evaluate dynamic spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that augmenting textual reasoning chains with dynamic visual drafts, overlaid on input images, significantly outperforms conventional approaches, offering new insights into spatial reasoning in evolving environments. To generalize this capability, we propose D2R (Dynamic Draft-Augmented Reasoning), a training-free framework that seamlessly integrates textual CoT with corresponding visual drafts into MLLMs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that D2R consistently enhances performance across diverse tasks, establishing a robust baseline for dynamic spatial reasoning without requiring model fine-tuning.

  LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) extend the capabilities of single LLMs by enabling cooperation among multiple specialized agents. However, most existing MAS frameworks rely on a single LLM to drive all agents, constraining the system's intelligence to the limit of that model. This paper explores the paradigm of heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS (X-MAS), where agents are powered by diverse LLMs, elevating the system's potential to the collective intelligence of diverse LLMs. We introduce X-MAS-Bench, a comprehensive testbed designed to evaluate the performance of various LLMs across different domains and MAS-related functions. As an extensive empirical study, we assess 27 LLMs across 5 domains (encompassing 21 test sets) and 5 functions, conducting over 1.7 million evaluations to identify optimal model selections for each domain-function combination. Building on these findings, we demonstrate that transitioning from homogeneous to heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS can significantly enhance system performance without requiring structural redesign. Specifically, in a chatbot-only MAS scenario, the heterogeneous configuration yields up to 8.4\% performance improvement on the MATH dataset. In a mixed chatbot-reasoner scenario, the heterogeneous MAS could achieve a remarkable 47\% performance boost on the AIME dataset. Our results underscore the transformative potential of heterogeneous LLMs in MAS, highlighting a promising avenue for advancing scalable, collaborative AI systems.

  Recent advances in mathematical problem-solving with language models (LMs) integrate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and code execution to harness their complementary strengths. However, existing hybrid frameworks exhibit a critical limitation: they depend on externally dictated instructions or rigid code-integration templates, lacking metacognitive awareness -- the capacity to dynamically evaluate intrinsic capabilities and autonomously determine when and how to integrate tools. This rigidity motivates our study of autonomous code integration, enabling models to adapt tool-usage strategies as their reasoning abilities evolve during training.While reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for boosting LLM reasoning at scale (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), we demonstrate its inefficiency in learning autonomous code integration due to inadequate exploration of the vast combinatorial space of CoT-code interleaving patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework that synergizes structured exploration (E-step) with off-policy RL optimization (M-step), creating a self-reinforcing cycle between metacognitive tool-use decisions and evolving capabilities. Experiments reveal our method achieves superior results through improved exploration. Notably, our 7B model improves over 11% on MATH500 and 9.4% on AIME without o1-like CoT.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced capabilities in real-world agentic applications. Growing research efforts aim to develop LLM-based agents to address practical demands, introducing a new challenge: agentic scenarios often involve lengthy instructions with complex constraints, such as extended system prompts and detailed tool specifications. While adherence to such instructions is crucial for agentic applications, whether LLMs can reliably follow them remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce AgentIF, the first benchmark for systematically evaluating LLM instruction following ability in agentic scenarios. AgentIF features three key characteristics: (1) Realistic, constructed from 50 real-world agentic applications. (2) Long, averaging 1,723 words with a maximum of 15,630 words. (3) Complex, averaging 11.9 constraints per instruction, covering diverse constraint types, such as tool specifications and condition constraints. To construct AgentIF, we collect 707 human-annotated instructions across 50 agentic tasks from industrial application agents and open-source agentic systems. For each instruction, we annotate the associated constraints and corresponding evaluation metrics, including code-based evaluation, LLM-based evaluation, and hybrid code-LLM evaluation. We use AgentIF to systematically evaluate existing advanced LLMs. We observe that current models generally perform poorly, especially in handling complex constraint structures and tool specifications. We further conduct error analysis and analytical experiments on instruction length and meta constraints, providing some findings about the failure modes of existing LLMs. We have released the code and data to facilitate future research.

  Recent advances have demonstrated that integrating reinforcement learning with rule-based rewards can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models, even without supervised fine-tuning. However, prevalent reinforcement learning algorithms such as GRPO and its variants like DAPO, suffer from a coarse granularity issue when computing the advantage. Specifically, they compute rollout-level advantages that assign identical values to every token within a sequence, failing to capture token-specific contributions and hindering effective learning. To address this limitation, we propose Key-token Advantage Estimation (KTAE) - a novel algorithm that estimates fine-grained, token-level advantages without introducing additional models. KTAE leverages the correctness of sampled rollouts and applies statistical analysis to quantify the importance of individual tokens within a sequence to the final outcome. This quantified token-level importance is then combined with the rollout-level advantage to obtain a more fine-grained token-level advantage estimation. Empirical results show that models trained with GRPO+KTAE and DAPO+KTAE outperform baseline methods across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Notably, they achieve higher accuracy with shorter responses and even surpass R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B using the same base model.

  Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, but often suffer from overthinking, generating redundant content regardless of task difficulty. Inspired by the dual process theory in cognitive science, we propose Adaptive Cognition Policy Optimization (ACPO), a reinforcement learning framework that enables LRMs to achieve efficient reasoning through adaptive cognitive allocation and dynamic system switch. ACPO incorporates two key components: (1) introducing system-aware reasoning tokens to explicitly represent the thinking modes thereby making the model's cognitive process transparent, and (2) integrating online difficulty estimation and token length budget to guide adaptive system switch and reasoning during reinforcement learning. To this end, we propose a two-stage training strategy. The first stage begins with supervised fine-tuning to cold start the model, enabling it to generate reasoning paths with explicit thinking modes. In the second stage, we apply ACPO to further enhance adaptive system switch for difficulty-aware reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that ACPO effectively reduces redundant reasoning while adaptively adjusting cognitive allocation based on task complexity, achieving efficient hybrid reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When using Large Language Models (LLMs) to support Knowledge Graph Engineering (KGE), one of the first indications when searching for an appropriate model is its size. According to the scaling laws, larger models typically show higher capabilities. However, in practice, resource costs are also an important factor and thus it makes sense to consider the ratio between model performance and costs. The LLM-KG-Bench framework enables the comparison of LLMs in the context of KGE tasks and assesses their capabilities of understanding and producing KGs and KG queries. Based on a dataset created in an LLM-KG-Bench run covering 26 open state-of-the-art LLMs, we explore the model size scaling laws specific to KGE tasks. In our analyses, we assess how benchmark scores evolve between different model size categories. Additionally, we inspect how the general score development of single models and families of models correlates to their size. Our analyses revealed that, with a few exceptions, the model size scaling laws generally also apply to the selected KGE tasks. However, in some cases, plateau or ceiling effects occurred, i.e., the task performance did not change much between a model and the next larger model. In these cases, smaller models could be considered to achieve high cost-effectiveness. Regarding models of the same family, sometimes larger models performed worse than smaller models of the same family. These effects occurred only locally. Hence it is advisable to additionally test the next smallest and largest model of the same family.

  As of 2025, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has become a central tool for productivity across industries. Beyond text generation, GenAI now plays a critical role in coding, data analysis, and research workflows. As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, it is essential to assess the reliability and accuracy of their outputs, especially in specialized, high-stakes domains like finance. Most modern LLMs transform text into numerical vectors, which are used in operations such as cosine similarity searches to generate responses. However, this abstraction process can lead to misinterpretation of emotional tone, particularly in nuanced financial contexts. While LLMs generally excel at identifying sentiment in everyday language, these models often struggle with the nuanced, strategically ambiguous language found in earnings call transcripts. Financial disclosures frequently embed sentiment in hedged statements, forward-looking language, and industry-specific jargon, making it difficult even for human analysts to interpret consistently, let alone AI models. This paper presents findings from the Santa Clara Microsoft Practicum Project, led by Professor Charlie Goldenberg, which benchmarks the performance of Microsoft's Copilot, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and traditional machine learning models for sentiment analysis of financial text. Using Microsoft earnings call transcripts, the analysis assesses how well LLM-derived sentiment correlates with market sentiment and stock movements and evaluates the accuracy of model outputs. Prompt engineering techniques are also examined to improve sentiment analysis results. Visualizations of sentiment consistency are developed to evaluate alignment between tone and stock performance, with sentiment trends analyzed across Microsoft's lines of business to determine which segments exert the greatest influence.

  We have seen remarkable progress in large language models (LLMs) empowered multi-agent systems solving complex tasks necessitating cooperation among experts with diverse skills. However, optimizing LLM-based multi-agent systems remains challenging. In this work, we perform an empirical case study on group optimization of role-based multi-agent systems utilizing natural language feedback for challenging software development tasks under various evaluation dimensions. We propose a two-step agent prompts optimization pipeline: identifying underperforming agents with their failure explanations utilizing textual feedback and then optimizing system prompts of identified agents utilizing failure explanations. We then study the impact of various optimization settings on system performance with two comparison groups: online against offline optimization and individual against group optimization. For group optimization, we study two prompting strategies: one-pass and multi-pass prompting optimizations. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization method for role-based multi-agent systems tackling software development tasks evaluated on diverse evaluation dimensions, and we investigate the impact of diverse optimization settings on group behaviors of the multi-agent systems to provide practical insights for future development.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are often challenged by generating erroneous or hallucinated responses, especially in complex reasoning tasks. Leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs) as external knowledge sources has emerged as a viable solution. However, existing KG-enhanced methods, either retrieval-based or agent-based, encounter difficulties in accurately retrieving knowledge and efficiently traversing KGs at scale. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, FiDeLiS, designed to improve the factuality of LLM responses by anchoring answers to verifiable reasoning steps retrieved from KGs. To achieve this, we leverage step-wise beam search with a deductive scoring function, allowing the LLM to validate reasoning process step by step, and halt the search once the question is deducible. In addition, we propose a Path-RAG module to pre-select a smaller candidate set for each beam search step, reducing computational costs by narrowing the search space. Extensive experiments show that our method, as a training-free framework, not only improve the performance but also enhance the factuality and interpretability across different benchmarks.

  Single-agent LLMs hit hard limits--finite context, role overload, and brittle domain transfer. Conventional multi-agent fixes soften those edges yet expose fresh pains: ill-posed decompositions, fuzzy contracts, and verification overhead that blunts the gains. We therefore present Know-The-Ropes (KtR), a framework that converts domain priors into an algorithmic blueprint hierarchy, in which tasks are recursively split into typed, controller-mediated subtasks, each solved zero-shot or with the lightest viable boost (e.g., chain-of-thought, micro-tune, self-check). Grounded in the No-Free-Lunch theorem, KtR trades the chase for a universal prompt for disciplined decomposition. On the Knapsack problem (3-8 items), three GPT-4o-mini agents raise accuracy from 3% zero-shot to 95% on size-5 instances after patching a single bottleneck agent. On the tougher Task-Assignment problem (6-15 jobs), a six-agent o3-mini blueprint hits 100% up to size 10 and 84% on sizes 13-15, versus 11% zero-shot. Algorithm-aware decomposition plus targeted augmentation thus turns modest models into reliable collaborators--no ever-larger monoliths required.

  GUI automation faces critical challenges in dynamic environments. MLLMs suffer from two key issues: misinterpreting UI components and outdated knowledge. Traditional fine-tuning methods are costly for app-specific knowledge updates. We propose GUI-explorer, a training-free GUI agent that incorporates two fundamental mechanisms: (1) Autonomous Exploration of Function-aware Trajectory. To comprehensively cover all application functionalities, we design a Function-aware Task Goal Generator that automatically constructs exploration goals by analyzing GUI structural information (e.g., screenshots and activity hierarchies). This enables systematic exploration to collect diverse trajectories. (2) Unsupervised Mining of Transition-aware Knowledge. To establish precise screen-operation logic, we develop a Transition-aware Knowledge Extractor that extracts effective screen-operation logic through unsupervised analysis the state transition of structured interaction triples (observation, action, outcome). This eliminates the need for human involvement in knowledge extraction. With a task success rate of 53.7% on SPA-Bench and 47.4% on AndroidWorld, GUI-explorer shows significant improvements over SOTA agents. It requires no parameter updates for new apps. GUI-explorer is open-sourced and publicly available atthis https URL.

  This paper presents a comprehensive synthesis of major breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) over the past fifteen years, integrating historical, theoretical, and technological perspectives. It identifies key inflection points in AI' s evolution by tracing the convergence of computational resources, data access, and algorithmic innovation. The analysis highlights how researchers enabled GPU based model training, triggered a data centric shift with ImageNet, simplified architectures through the Transformer, and expanded modeling capabilities with the GPT series. Rather than treating these advances as isolated milestones, the paper frames them as indicators of deeper paradigm shifts. By applying concepts from statistical learning theory such as sample complexity and data efficiency, the paper explains how researchers translated breakthroughs into scalable solutions and why the field must now embrace data centric approaches. In response to rising privacy concerns and tightening regulations, the paper evaluates emerging solutions like federated learning, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs), and the data site paradigm, which reframe data access and security. In cases where real world data remains inaccessible, the paper also assesses the utility and constraints of mock and synthetic data generation. By aligning technical insights with evolving data infrastructure, this study offers strategic guidance for future AI research and policy development.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from passive text generators to active reasoning agents capable of tool interaction, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standardized framework for dynamic tool discovery and orchestration. Despite widespread industry adoption, existing evaluation methodologies fail to adequately assess tool utilization capabilities within this new paradigm. This paper introduces MCP-RADAR, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in the MCP framework through a novel five-dimensional approach measuring: answer accuracy, tool selection efficiency, computational resource efficiency, parameter construction accuracy, and execution speed. Unlike conventional benchmarks that rely on subjective human evaluations or binary success metrics, MCP-RADAR employs objective, quantifiable measurements across multiple task domains including software engineering, mathematical reasoning, and general problem-solving. Our evaluations of leading commercial and open-source LLMs reveal distinctive capability profiles with significant trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and speed, challenging traditional single-metric performance rankings. Besides, we provide valuable guidance for developers to optimize their tools for maximum model compatibility and effectiveness. While focused on MCP due to its standardized approach, our methodology remains applicable across all LLM agent tool integration frameworks, providing valuable insights for both LLM developers and tool creators to optimize the entire LLM-tool interaction ecosystem. The implementation, configurations, and datasets used in our evaluation are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models have achieved remarkable results on a variety of mathematical benchmarks. However, concerns remain as to whether these successes reflect genuine mathematical reasoning or superficial pattern recognition. Common evaluation metrics, such as final answer accuracy, fail to disentangle the underlying competencies involved, offering limited diagnostic value. To address these limitations, we introduce SMART: a Self-Generating and Self-Validating Multi-Dimensional Assessment Framework. SMART decomposes mathematical problem solving into four distinct dimensions: understanding, reasoning, arithmetic, and reflection \& refinement. Each dimension is evaluated independently through tailored tasks, enabling interpretable and fine-grained analysis of LLM behavior. Crucially, SMART integrates an automated self-generating and self-validating mechanism to produce and verify benchmark data, ensuring both scalability and reliability. We apply SMART to 21 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LLMs, uncovering significant discrepancies in their abilities across different dimensions. Our findings demonstrate the inadequacy of final answer accuracy as a sole metric and motivate a new holistic metric to better capture true problem-solving capabilities. Code and benchmarks will be released upon acceptance.

  With recent Nobel Prizes recognising AI contributions to science, Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming scientific research by enhancing productivity and reshaping the scientific method. LLMs are now involved in experimental design, data analysis, and workflows, particularly in chemistry and biology. However, challenges such as hallucinations and reliability persist. In this contribution, we review how Large Language Models (LLMs) are redefining the scientific method and explore their potential applications across different stages of the scientific cycle, from hypothesis testing to discovery. We conclude that, for LLMs to serve as relevant and effective creative engines and productivity enhancers, their deep integration into all steps of the scientific process should be pursued in collaboration and alignment with human scientific goals, with clear evaluation metrics. The transition to AI-driven science raises ethical questions about creativity, oversight, and responsibility. With careful guidance, LLMs could evolve into creative engines, driving transformative breakthroughs across scientific disciplines responsibly and effectively. However, the scientific community must also decide how much it leaves to LLMs to drive science, even when associations with 'reasoning', mostly currently undeserved, are made in exchange for the potential to explore hypothesis and solution regions that might otherwise remain unexplored by human exploration alone.

  We present a novel pipeline, ReflectEvo, to demonstrate that small language models (SLMs) can enhance meta introspection through reflection learning. This process iteratively generates self-reflection for self-training, fostering a continuous and self-evolving process. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct ReflectEvo-460k, a large-scale, comprehensive, self-generated reflection dataset with broadened instructions and diverse multi-domain tasks. Building upon this dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of reflection learning to improve SLMs' reasoning abilities using SFT and DPO with remarkable performance, substantially boosting Llama-3 from 52.4% to 71.2% and Mistral from 44.4% to 71.1%. It validates that ReflectEvo can rival or even surpass the reasoning capability of the three prominent open-sourced models on BIG-bench without distillation from superior models or fine-grained human annotation. We further conduct a deeper analysis of the high quality of self-generated reflections and their impact on error localization and correction.

  Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled unified processing of language, vision, and structured inputs, opening the door to complex tasks such as logical deduction, spatial reasoning, and scientific analysis. Despite their promise, the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, particularly those augmented with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T), remain poorly understood and lack standardized evaluation benchmarks. Existing work focuses primarily on perception or final answer correctness, offering limited insight into how models reason or fail across modalities. To address this gap, we introduce the MMMR, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking. The MMMR comprises 1) a high-difficulty dataset of 1,083 questions spanning six diverse reasoning types with symbolic depth and multi-hop demands and 2) a modular Reasoning Trace Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP) for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy through metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotations. Empirical results show that MLLMs-T overall outperform non-thinking counterparts, but even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5 Pro suffer from reasoning pathologies such as inconsistency and overthinking. This benchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and provides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development. Overall, the MMMR offers a scalable foundation for evaluating, comparing, and improving the next generation of multi-modal reasoning systems.

  _Jiawei Liu, Qisi Chen, Jianshu Zhang, Quan Liu, Defu Lian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning through search algorithms, yet current strategies often suffer from massive token consumption due to redundant exploration of semantically equivalent steps. Existing semantic similarity methods struggle to accurately identify such equivalence in domain-specific contexts like mathematical reasoning. To address this, we propose EquivPruner, a simple yet effective approach that identifies and prunes semantically equivalent actions during LLM reasoning search. We also introduce MathEquiv, the first dataset we created for mathematical statement equivalence, which enables the training of a lightweight equivalence detector. Extensive experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate that EquivPruner significantly reduces token consumption, improving searching efficiency and often bolstering reasoning accuracy. For instance, when applied to Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on GSM8K, EquivPruner reduced token consumption by 48.1\% while also improving accuracy. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning models trained on extensive Electronic Health Records (EHR) data have achieved high accuracy in diagnosis prediction, offering the potential to assist clinicians in decision-making and treatment planning. However, these models lack two crucial features that clinicians highly value: interpretability and interactivity. The ``black-box'' nature of these models makes it difficult for clinicians to understand the reasoning behind predictions, limiting their ability to make informed decisions. Additionally, the absence of interactive mechanisms prevents clinicians from incorporating their own knowledge and experience into the decision-making process. To address these limitations, we propose II-KEA, a knowledge-enhanced agent-driven causal discovery framework that integrates personalized knowledge databases and agentic LLMs. II-KEA enhances interpretability through explicit reasoning and causal analysis, while also improving interactivity by allowing clinicians to inject their knowledge and experience through customized knowledge bases and prompts. II-KEA is evaluated on both MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrating superior performance along with enhanced interpretability and interactivity, as evidenced by its strong results from extensive case studies.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle diverse tasks by incorporating multiple input-output examples, known as demonstrations, into the input of LLMs. More recently, advancements in the expanded context windows of LLMs have led to many-shot ICL, which uses hundreds of demonstrations and outperforms few-shot ICL, which relies on fewer examples. However, this approach is often hindered by the high cost of obtaining large amounts of labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Many-Shot Adaptive Pseudo-LabEling, namely MAPLE, a novel influence-based many-shot ICL framework that utilizes pseudo-labeled samples to compensate for the lack of label information. We first identify a subset of impactful unlabeled samples and perform pseudo-labeling on them by querying LLMs. These pseudo-labeled samples are then adaptively selected and tailored to each test query as input to improve the performance of many-shot ICL, without significant labeling costs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its ability to enhance LLM adaptability and performance with limited labeled data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of large language models has unlocked remarkable capabilities across a diverse array of natural language processing tasks. However, the considerable differences among available LLMs-in terms of cost, performance, and computational demands-pose significant challenges for users aiming to identify the most suitable model for specific tasks. In this work, we present LightRouter, a novel framework designed to systematically select and integrate a small subset of LLMs from a larger pool, with the objective of jointly optimizing both task performance and cost efficiency. LightRouter leverages an adaptive selection mechanism to identify models that require only a minimal number of boot tokens, thereby reducing costs, and further employs an effective integration strategy to combine their outputs. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LightRouter matches or outperforms widely-used ensemble baselines, achieving up to a 25% improvement in accuracy. Compared with leading high-performing models, LightRouter achieves comparable performance while reducing inference costs by up to 27%. Importantly, our framework operates without any prior knowledge of individual models and relies exclusively on inexpensive, lightweight models. This work introduces a practical approach for efficient LLM selection and provides valuable insights into optimal strategies for model combination.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of large models has intensified the need for efficient data valuation methods to quantify the contribution of individual data providers. Traditional approaches, such as game-theory-based Shapley value and influence-function-based techniques, face prohibitive computational costs or require access to full data and model training details, making them hardly achieve partial data valuation. To address this, we propose Unlearning Shapley, a novel framework that leverages machine unlearning to estimate data values efficiently. By unlearning target data from a pretrained model and measuring performance shifts on a reachable test set, our method computes Shapley values via Monte Carlo sampling, avoiding retraining and eliminating dependence on full data. Crucially, Unlearning Shapley supports both full and partial data valuation, making it scalable for large models (e.g., LLMs) and practical for data markets. Experiments on benchmark datasets and large-scale text corpora demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational overhead by orders of magnitude. Further analysis confirms a strong correlation between estimated values and the true impact of data subsets, validating its reliability in real-world scenarios. This work bridges the gap between data valuation theory and practical deployment, offering a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for modern AI ecosystems.

  The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has reshaped agent systems. Unlike traditional rule-based agents with limited task scope, LLM-powered agents offer greater flexibility, cross-domain reasoning, and natural language interaction. Moreover, with the integration of multi-modal LLMs, current agent systems are highly capable of processing diverse data modalities, including text, images, audio, and structured tabular data, enabling richer and more adaptive real-world behavior. This paper comprehensively examines the evolution of agent systems from the pre-LLM era to current LLM-powered architectures. We categorize agent systems into software-based, physical, and adaptive hybrid systems, highlighting applications across customer service, software development, manufacturing automation, personalized education, financial trading, and healthcare. We further discuss the primary challenges posed by LLM-powered agents, including high inference latency, output uncertainty, lack of evaluation metrics, and security vulnerabilities, and propose potential solutions to mitigate these concerns.

  Solving puzzles in natural language poses a long-standing challenge in AI. While large language models (LLMs) have recently shown impressive capabilities in a variety of tasks, they continue to struggle with complex puzzles that demand precise reasoning and exhaustive search. In this paper, we propose Logic-of-Thought (Logot), a novel framework that bridges LLMs with logic programming to address this problem. Our method leverages LLMs to translate puzzle rules and states into answer set programs (ASPs), the solution of which are then accurately and efficiently inferred by an ASP interpreter. This hybrid approach combines the natural language understanding of LLMs with the precise reasoning capabilities of logic programs. We evaluate our method on various grid puzzles and dynamic puzzles involving actions, demonstrating near-perfect accuracy across all tasks. Our code and data are available at:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Developing artificial intelligence (AI) for vertical domains requires a solid data foundation for both training and evaluation. In this work, we introduce TrialPanorama, a large-scale, structured database comprising 1,657,476 clinical trial records aggregated from 15 global sources. The database captures key aspects of trial design and execution, including trial setups, interventions, conditions, biomarkers, and outcomes, and links them to standard biomedical ontologies such as DrugBank and MedDRA. This structured and ontology-grounded design enables TrialPanorama to serve as a unified, extensible resource for a wide range of clinical trial tasks, including trial planning, design, and summarization. To demonstrate its utility, we derive a suite of benchmark tasks directly from the TrialPanorama database. The benchmark spans eight tasks across two categories: three for systematic review (study search, study screening, and evidence summarization) and five for trial design (arm design, eligibility criteria, endpoint selection, sample size estimation, and trial completion assessment). The experiments using five state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) show that while general-purpose LLMs exhibit some zero-shot capability, their performance is still inadequate for high-stakes clinical trial workflows. We release TrialPanorama database and the benchmark to facilitate further research on AI for clinical trials.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Memory is a critical component in large language model (LLM)-based agents, enabling them to store and retrieve past executions to improve task performance over time. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on how memory management choices impact the LLM agents' behavior, especially their long-term performance. Specifically, we focus on two fundamental memory operations that are widely used by many agent frameworks-addition, which incorporates new experiences into the memory base, and deletion, which selectively removes past experiences-to systematically study their impact on the agent behavior. Through our quantitative analysis, we find that LLM agents display an experience-following property: high similarity between a task input and the input in a retrieved memory record often results in highly similar agent outputs. Our analysis further reveals two significant challenges associated with this property: error propagation, where inaccuracies in past experiences compound and degrade future performance, and misaligned experience replay, where outdated or irrelevant experiences negatively influence current tasks. Through controlled experiments, we show that combining selective addition and deletion strategies can help mitigate these negative effects, yielding an average absolute performance gain of 10% compared to naive memory growth. Furthermore, we highlight how memory management choices affect agents' behavior under challenging conditions such as task distribution shifts and constrained memory resources. Our findings offer insights into the behavioral dynamics of LLM agent memory systems and provide practical guidance for designing memory components that support robust, long-term agent performance. We also release our code to facilitate further study.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a novel dataset designed to benchmark the physical and spatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) based on topology optimization, a method for computing optimal material distributions within a design space under prescribed loads and supports. In this dataset, LLMs are provided with conditions such as 2D boundary, applied forces and supports, and must reason about the resulting optimal material distribution. The dataset includes a variety of tasks, ranging from filling in masked regions within partial structures to predicting complete material distributions. Solving these tasks requires understanding the flow of forces and the required material distribution under given constraints, without access to simulation tools or explicit physical models, challenging models to reason about structural stability and spatial organization. Our dataset targets the evaluation of spatial and physical reasoning abilities in 2D settings, offering a complementary perspective to traditional language and logic benchmarks.

  Existing benchmarks fail to capture a crucial aspect of intelligence: physical reasoning, the integrated ability to combine domain knowledge, symbolic reasoning, and understanding of real-world constraints. To address this gap, we introduce PhyX: the first large-scale benchmark designed to assess models capacity for physics-grounded reasoning in visual scenarios. PhyX includes 3K meticulously curated multimodal questions spanning 6 reasoning types across 25 sub-domains and 6 core physics domains: thermodynamics, electromagnetism, mechanics, modern physics, optics, and wave\&acoustics. In our comprehensive evaluation, even state-of-the-art models struggle significantly with physical reasoning. GPT-4o, Claude3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-o4-mini achieve only 32.5\%, 42.2\%, and 45.8\% accuracy respectively-performance gaps exceeding 29\% compared to human experts. Our analysis exposes critical limitations in current models: over-reliance on memorized disciplinary knowledge, excessive dependence on mathematical formulations, and surface-level visual pattern matching rather than genuine physical understanding. We provide in-depth analysis through fine-grained statistics, detailed case studies, and multiple evaluation paradigms to thoroughly examine physical reasoning capabilities. To ensure reproducibility, we implement a compatible evaluation protocol based on widely-used toolkits such as VLMEvalKit, enabling one-click evaluation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Query routing, the task to route user queries to different large language model (LLM) endpoints, can be considered as a text classification problem. However, out-of-distribution queries must be handled properly, as those could be questions about unrelated domains, queries in other languages, or even contain unsafe text. Here, we thus study a guarded query routing problem, for which we first introduce the Guarded Query Routing Benchmark (GQR-Bench), which covers three exemplary target domains (law, finance, and healthcare), and seven datasets to test robustness against out-of-distribution queries. We then use GQR-Bench to contrast the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM-based routing mechanisms (GPT-4o-mini, Llama-3.2-3B, and Llama-3.1-8B), standard LLM-based guardrail approaches (LlamaGuard and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails), continuous bag-of-words classifiers (WideMLP, fastText), and traditional machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost). Our results show that WideMLP, enhanced with out-of-domain detection capabilities, yields the best trade-off between accuracy (88%) and speed (<4ms). The embedding-based fastText excels at speed (<1ms) with acceptable accuracy (80%), whereas LLMs yield the highest accuracy (91%) but are comparatively slow (62ms for local Llama-3.1:8B and 669ms for remote GPT-4o-mini calls). Our findings challenge the automatic reliance on LLMs for (guarded) query routing and provide concrete recommendations for practical applications. GQR-Bench will be released as a Python package -- gqr.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models struggle with representing and generating rare tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. In this study, we identify neuron structures with exceptionally strong influence on language model's prediction of rare tokens, termed as rare token neurons, and investigate the mechanism for their emergence and behavior. These neurons exhibit a characteristic three-phase organization (plateau, power-law, and rapid decay) that emerges dynamically during training, evolving from a homogeneous initial state to a functionally differentiated architecture. In the activation space, rare token neurons form a coordinated subnetwork that selectively co-activates while avoiding co-activation with other neurons. This functional specialization potentially correlates with the development of heavy-tailed weight distributions, suggesting a statistical mechanical basis for emergent specialization.

  The growing capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt a reassessment of the interaction mechanisms between users and their devices. Currently, users are required to use a set of high-level applications to achieve their desired results. However, the advent of AI may signal a shift in this regard, as its capabilities have generated novel prospects for user-provided intent resolution through the deployment of model-generated code. This development represents a significant progression in the realm of hybrid workflows, where human and artificial intelligence collaborate to address user intentions, with the former responsible for defining these intentions and the latter for implementing the solutions to address them. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of generating and executing workflows through code generation that results from prompting an LLM with a concrete user intention, and a simplified application programming interface for a GUI-less operating system. We provide an in-depth analysis and comparison of various user intentions, the resulting code, and its execution. The findings demonstrate the general feasibility of our approach and that the employed LLM, GPT-4o-mini, exhibits remarkable proficiency in the generation of code-oriented workflows in accordance with provided user intentions.

  Embodied Question Answering (EQA) has primarily focused on indoor environments, leaving the complexities of urban settings-spanning environment, action, and perception-largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce CityEQA, a new task where an embodied agent answers open-vocabulary questions through active exploration in dynamic city spaces. To support this task, we present CityEQA-EC, the first benchmark dataset featuring 1,412 human-annotated tasks across six categories, grounded in a realistic 3D urban simulator. Moreover, we propose Planner-Manager-Actor (PMA), a novel agent tailored for CityEQA. PMA enables long-horizon planning and hierarchical task execution: the Planner breaks down the question answering into sub-tasks, the Manager maintains an object-centric cognitive map for spatial reasoning during the process control, and the specialized Actors handle navigation, exploration, and collection sub-tasks. Experiments demonstrate that PMA achieves 60.7% of human-level answering accuracy, significantly outperforming competitive baselines. While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights the need for enhanced visual reasoning in CityEQA. This work paves the way for future advancements in urban spatial intelligence.

  Model collapse, a phenomenon characterized by performance degradation due to iterative training on synthetic data, has been widely studied. However, its implications for bias amplification, the progressive intensification of pre-existing societal biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), remain significantly underexplored, despite the growing influence of LLMs in shaping online discourse. In this paper, we introduce a open, generational, and long-context benchmark specifically designed to measure political bias amplification in LLMs, leveraging sentence continuation tasks derived from a comprehensive dataset of U.S. political news. Our empirical study using GPT-2 reveals consistent and substantial political bias intensification (e.g., right-leaning amplification) over iterative synthetic training cycles. We evaluate three mitigation strategies, Overfitting, Preservation, and Accumulation, and demonstrate that bias amplification persists independently of model collapse, even when the latter is effectively controlled. Furthermore, we propose a mechanistic analysis approach that identifies neurons correlated with specific phenomena during inference through regression and statistical tests. This analysis uncovers largely distinct neuron populations driving bias amplification and model collapse, underscoring fundamentally different underlying mechanisms. Finally, we supplement our empirical findings with theoretical intuition that explains the separate origins of these phenomena, guiding targeted strategies for bias mitigation.

  This paper proposes a novel prompting approach, Judgment of Thought (JoT), specifically tailored for binary logical reasoning tasks. Despite advances in prompt engineering, existing approaches still face limitations in handling complex logical reasoning tasks. To address these issues, JoT introduces a multi-agent approach with three specialized roles$\unicode{x2010}$$\unicode{x2010}$$\unicode{x2010}$lawyer, prosecutor, and judge$\unicode{x2010}$$\unicode{x2010}$$\unicode{x2010}$where a high-level model acts as the judge, and lower-level models serve as lawyer and prosecutor to systematically debate and evaluate arguments. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks such as BigBenchHard and Winogrande demonstrate JoT's superior performance compared to existing prompting approaches, achieving notable improvements, including 98\% accuracy in Boolean expressions. Also, our ablation studies validate the critical contribution of each role, iterative refinement loops, and feedback mechanisms. Consequently, JoT significantly enhances accuracy, reliability, and consistency in binary reasoning tasks and shows potential for practical applications.
