- **[Rethinking the Embodied Gap in Vision-and-Language Navigation: A Holistic Study of Physical and Visual Disparities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13019)**  `arXiv:2507.13019`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.CV`

  Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free, map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is available atthis https URL.

- **[osmAG-LLM: Zero-Shot Open-Vocabulary Object Navigation via Semantic Maps and Large Language Models Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12753)**  `arXiv:2507.12753`  `cs.RO`  
  _Fujing Xie, S√∂ren Schwertfeger, Hermann Blum_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent open-vocabulary robot mapping methods enrich dense geometric maps with pre-trained visual-language features, achieving a high level of detail and guiding robots to find objects specified by open-vocabulary language queries. While the issue of scalability for such approaches has received some attention, another fundamental problem is that high-detail object mapping quickly becomes outdated, as objects get moved around a lot. In this work, we develop a mapping and navigation system for object-goal navigation that, from the ground up, considers the possibilities that a queried object can have moved, or may not be mapped at all. Instead of striving for high-fidelity mapping detail, we consider that the main purpose of a map is to provide environment grounding and context, which we combine with the semantic priors of LLMs to reason about object locations and deploy an active, online approach to navigate to the objects. Through simulated and real-world experiments we find that our approach tends to have higher retrieval success at shorter path lengths for static objects and by far outperforms prior approaches in cases of dynamic or unmapped object queries. We provide our code and dataset at:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous robots are increasingly being tested into public spaces to enhance user experiences, particularly in cultural and educational settings. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the autonomous museum guide robot Alter-Ego equipped with advanced navigation and interactive capabilities. The robot leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide real-time, context aware question-and-answer (Q&A) interactions, allowing visitors to engage in conversations about exhibits. It also employs robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques, enabling seamless navigation through museum spaces and route adaptation based on user requests. The system was tested in a real museum environment with 34 participants, combining qualitative analysis of visitor-robot conversations and quantitative analysis of pre and post interaction surveys. Results showed that the robot was generally well-received and contributed to an engaging museum experience, despite some limitations in comprehension and responsiveness. This study sheds light on HRI in cultural spaces, highlighting not only the potential of AI-driven robotics to support accessibility and knowledge acquisition, but also the current limitations and challenges of deploying such technologies in complex, real-world environments.

- **[Human Demonstrations are Generalizable Knowledge for Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02419)**  `arXiv:2312.02419`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning from human demonstrations is an emerging trend for designing intelligent robotic systems. However, previous methods typically regard videos as instructions, simply dividing them into action sequences for robotic repetition, which poses obstacles to generalization to diverse tasks or object instances. In this paper, we propose a different perspective, considering human demonstration videos not as mere instructions, but as a source of knowledge for robots. Motivated by this perspective and the remarkable comprehension and generalization capabilities exhibited by large language models (LLMs), we propose DigKnow, a method that DIstills Generalizable KNOWledge with a hierarchical structure. Specifically, DigKnow begins by converting human demonstration video frames into observation knowledge. This knowledge is then subjected to analysis to extract human action knowledge and further distilled into pattern knowledge compassing task and object instances, resulting in the acquisition of generalizable knowledge with a hierarchical structure. In settings with different tasks or object instances, DigKnow retrieves relevant knowledge for the current task and object instances. Subsequently, the LLM-based planner conducts planning based on the retrieved knowledge, and the policy executes actions in line with the plan to achieve the designated task. Utilizing the retrieved knowledge, we validate and rectify planning and execution outcomes, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the success rate. Experimental results across a range of tasks and scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in facilitating real-world robots to accomplish tasks with the knowledge derived from human demonstrations.

- **[Probabilistic Soundness Guarantees in LLM Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12948)**  `arXiv:2507.12948`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2 points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6 points).

  In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), alignment has emerged as a fundamental yet challenging problem in the pursuit of more reliable, controllable, and capable machine intelligence. The recent success of reasoning models and conversational AI systems has underscored the critical role of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing these systems, driving increased research interest at the intersection of RL and LLM alignment. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in LLM alignment through the lens of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), emphasizing the distinctions between RL techniques employed in LLM alignment and those in conventional RL tasks. In particular, we highlight the necessity of constructing neural reward models from human data and discuss the formal and practical implications of this paradigm shift. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts in RL to provide a foundation for readers unfamiliar with the field. We then examine recent advances in this research agenda, discussing key challenges and opportunities in conducting IRL for LLM alignment. Beyond methodological considerations, we explore practical aspects, including datasets, benchmarks, evaluation metrics, infrastructure, and computationally efficient training and inference techniques. Finally, we draw insights from the literature on sparse-reward RL to identify open questions and potential research directions. By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, we aim to provide a structured and critical overview of the field, highlight unresolved challenges, and outline promising future directions for improving LLM alignment through RL and IRL techniques.

  Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability of LLMs.

  Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in transforming healthcare through the analysis and modeling of electronic health records (EHRs). However, the inherent heterogeneity, temporal irregularity, and domain-specific nature of EHR data present unique challenges that differ fundamentally from those in vision and natural language tasks. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements at the intersection of deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and EHR modeling. We introduce a unified taxonomy that spans five key design dimensions: data-centric approaches, neural architecture design, learning-focused strategies, multimodal learning, and LLM-based modeling systems. Within each dimension, we review representative methods addressing data quality enhancement, structural and temporal representation, self-supervised learning, and integration with clinical knowledge. We further highlight emerging trends such as foundation models, LLM-driven clinical agents, and EHR-to-text translation for downstream reasoning. Finally, we discuss open challenges in benchmarking, explainability, clinical alignment, and generalization across diverse clinical settings. This survey aims to provide a structured roadmap for advancing AI-driven EHR modeling and clinical decision support. For a comprehensive list of EHR-related methods, kindly refer tothis https URL.

- **[Scaling Up RL: Unlocking Diverse Reasoning in LLMs via Prolonged Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12507)**  `arXiv:2507.12507`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Mingjie Liu, Shizhe Diao, Jian Hu, Ximing Lu, Xin Dong, Hao Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in reasoning-focused language models such as OpenAI's O1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown that scaling test-time computation-through chain-of-thought reasoning and iterative exploration-can yield substantial improvements on complex tasks like mathematics and code generation. These breakthroughs have been driven by large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when combined with verifiable reward signals that provide objective and grounded supervision. In this report, we investigate the effects of prolonged reinforcement learning on a small language model across a diverse set of reasoning domains. Our work identifies several key ingredients for effective training, including the use of verifiable reward tasks, enhancements to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and practical techniques to improve training stability and generalization. We introduce controlled KL regularization, clipping ratio, and periodic reference policy resets as critical components for unlocking long-term performance gains. Our model achieves significant improvements over strong baselines, including +14.7% on math, +13.9% on coding, and +54.8% on logic puzzle tasks. To facilitate continued research, we release our model publicly.

- **[Cross-Layer Discrete Concept Discovery for Interpreting Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20040)**  `arXiv:2506.20040`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Uncovering emergent concepts across transformer layers remains a significant challenge because the residual stream linearly mixes and duplicates information, obscuring how features evolve within large language models. Current research efforts primarily inspect neural representations at single layers, thereby overlooking this cross-layer superposition and the redundancy it introduces. These representations are typically either analyzed directly for activation patterns or passed to probing classifiers that map them to a limited set of predefined concepts. To address these limitations, we propose cross-layer VQ-VAE (CLVQ-VAE), a framework that uses vector quantization to map representations across layers and in the process collapse duplicated residual-stream features into compact, interpretable concept vectors. Our approach uniquely combines top-k temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook updates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while maintaining code-book diversity. We further enhance the framework with scaled-spherical k-means++ for codebook initialization, which clusters by directional similarity rather than magnitude, better aligning with semantic structure in word embedding space.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o can handle a wide range of complex tasks with the right prompt. As per token costs are reduced, the advantages of fine-tuning Small Language Models (SLMs) for real-world applications -- faster inference, lower costs -- may no longer be clear. In this work, we present evidence that, for domain-specific tasks that require structured outputs, SLMs still have a quality advantage. We compare fine-tuning an SLM against prompting LLMs on the task of generating low-code workflows in JSON form. We observe that while a good prompt can yield reasonable results, fine-tuning improves quality by 10% on average. We also perform systematic error analysis to reveal model limitations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces a model's memory footprint by mapping full precision weights into low bit weights without costly retraining, but can degrade its downstream performance especially in low 2- to 3-bit settings. We develop a new mixed-precision PTQ approach, Task-Circuit Quantization (TaCQ), that draws parallels to automated circuit discovery, directly conditioning the quantization process on specific weight circuits -- which we define as sets of weights associated with downstream task performance. These weights are kept as 16-bit weights, while others are quantized, maintaining performance while only adding a marginal memory cost. Specifically, TaCQ contrasts unquantized model weights with a uniformly-quantized model to estimate the expected change in weights due to quantization and uses gradient information to predict the resulting impact on task performance, allowing us to preserve task-specific weights. We compare TaCQ-based quantization to existing mixed-precision quantization methods when conditioning both on general-purpose and task-specific data. Across QA, math reasoning, and text-to-SQL tasks for both Llama-3 and Qwen2.5, we find that TaCQ outperforms baselines using the same calibration data and a lower weight budget, achieving major improvements in the 2 and 3-bit regime. With only 3.1 bits we are able to recover 96% of Llama-3-8B-Instruct's unquantized 16-bit MMLU performance, obtaining a 5.25% absolute improvement over SPQR. We also observe consistently large gains over existing methods in the 2-bit regime, with an average gain of 14.74% over the strongest baseline, SliM-LLM. Moreover, we observe a 7.20% gain without conditioning on specific tasks, showing TaCQ's ability to identify important weights is not limited to task-conditioned settings.

  User specifications or legal frameworks often require information to be removed from pretrained models, including large language models (LLMs). This requires deleting or "forgetting" a set of data points from an already-trained model, which typically degrades its performance on other data points. Thus, a balance must be struck between removing information and keeping the model's other abilities intact, with a failure to balance this trade-off leading to poor deletion or an unusable model. To this end, we propose UPCORE (Utility-Preserving Coreset Selection), a method-agnostic data selection framework for mitigating collateral damage during unlearning. Finding that the model damage is correlated with the variance of the model's representations on the forget set, we selectively prune the forget set to remove outliers, thereby minimizing model degradation after unlearning. Across three standard unlearning methods, UPCORE consistently achieves a superior balance between the competing objectives of deletion efficacy and model preservation. To better evaluate this trade-off, we introduce a new metric, measuring the area-under-the-curve (AUC) across standard metrics. Our results show that UPCORE improves both standard metrics and AUC, benefiting from positive transfer between the coreset and pruned points while reducing negative transfer from the forget set to points outside of it.

  _Jui-Nan Yen, Si Si, Zhao Meng, Felix Yu, Sai Surya Duvvuri, Inderjit S. Dhillon, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-rank adaption (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient finetuning method for LLM that reduces memory requirements. However, current LoRA optimizers lack transformation invariance, meaning the actual updates to the weights depends on how the two LoRA factors are scaled or rotated. This deficiency leads to inefficient learning and sub-optimal solutions in practice. This paper introduces LoRA-RITE, a novel adaptive matrix preconditioning method for LoRA optimization, which can achieve transformation invariance and remain computationally efficient. We provide theoretical analysis to demonstrate the benefit of our method and conduct experiments on various LLM tasks with different models including Gemma 2B, 7B, and mT5-XXL. The results demonstrate consistent improvements against existing optimizers. For example, replacing Adam with LoRA-RITE during LoRA fine-tuning of Gemma-2B yielded 4.6\% accuracy gain on Super-Natural Instructions and 3.5\% accuracy gain across other four LLM benchmarks (HellaSwag, ArcChallenge, GSM8K, OpenBookQA).

- **[Supervised Fine Tuning on Curated Data is Reinforcement Learning (and can be improved)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12856)**  `arXiv:2507.12856`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Chongli Qin, Jost Tobias Springenberg_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Behavior Cloning (BC) on curated (or filtered) data is the predominant paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models; as well as for imitation learning of control policies. Here, we draw on a connection between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data. The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks. For example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

  The performance of finetuned large language models (LLMs) hinges critically on the composition of the training mixture. However, selecting an optimal blend of task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with practitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We introduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization that selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over a Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral divergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information computed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our method yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate consistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation suites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning.

- **[Learning Universal Human Mobility Patterns with a Foundation Model for Cross-domain Data Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15779)**  `arXiv:2503.15779`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human mobility modeling is critical for urban planning and transportation management, yet existing approaches often lack the integration capabilities needed to handle diverse data sources. We present a foundation model framework for universal human mobility patterns that leverages cross-domain data fusion and large language models to address these limitations. Our approach integrates multi-modal data of distinct nature and spatio-temporal resolution, including geographical, mobility, socio-demographic, and traffic information, to construct a privacy-preserving and semantically enriched human travel trajectory dataset. Our framework demonstrates adaptability through domain transfer techniques that ensure transferability across diverse urban contexts, as evidenced in case studies of Los Angeles (LA) and Egypt. The framework employs LLMs for semantic enrichment of trajectory data, enabling comprehensive understanding of mobility patterns. Quantitative evaluation shows that our generated synthetic dataset accurately reproduces mobility patterns observed in empirical data. The practical utility of this foundation model approach is demonstrated through large-scale traffic simulations for LA County, where results align well with observed traffic data. On California's I-405 corridor, the simulation yields a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 5.85% for traffic volume and 4.36% for speed compared to Caltrans PeMS observations, illustrating the framework's potential for intelligent transportation systems and urban mobility applications.

- **[Training Transformers with Enforced Lipschitz Constants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13338)**  `arXiv:2507.13338`  `cs.LG`  
  _Laker Newhouse, R. Preston Hess, Franz Cesista, Andrii Zahorodnii, Jeremy Bernstein, Phillip Isola_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural networks are often highly sensitive to input and weight perturbations. This sensitivity has been linked to pathologies such as vulnerability to adversarial examples, divergent training, and overfitting. To combat these problems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from Lipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point where researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with a Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization. To explore this gap, we begin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for maintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able to train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training. We find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves standard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models to reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's update having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method that improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter transformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches validation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz transformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the NanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound increases to 10^264. Nonetheless, our Lipschitz transformers train without stability measures such as layer norm, QK norm, and logit tanh softcapping.

- **[GeoReg: Weight-Constrained Few-Shot Regression for Socio-Economic Estimation using LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13323)**  `arXiv:2507.13323`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Socio-economic indicators like regional GDP, population, and education levels, are crucial to shaping policy decisions and fostering sustainable development. This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates diverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial information, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as developing countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large language model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM functioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable effective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains contextual relationships between data features and the target indicator, categorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant. These features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight constraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also identifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with nonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different stages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in estimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with limited data availability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The effect of representation has been demonstrated in reinforcement learning, from both theoretical and empirical successes. However, the existing representation learning mainly induced from model learning aspects, misaligning with our RL tasks. This work introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a novel framework derived from the Inherent Bellman Error (IBE) condition, which aligns with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates across a space of possible value functions, therefore, directly towards value-based RL. Our key insight is the discovery of a fundamental spectral relationship: under the zero-IBE condition, the transformation of a distribution of value functions by the Bellman operator is intrinsically linked to the feature covariance structure. This spectral connection yields a new, theoretically-grounded objective for learning state-action features that inherently capture this Bellman-aligned covariance. Our method requires a simple modification to existing algorithms. We demonstrate that our learned representations enable structured exploration, by aligning feature covariance with Bellman dynamics, and improve overall performance, particularly in challenging hard-exploration and long-horizon credit assignment tasks. Our framework naturally extends to powerful multi-step Bellman operators, further broadening its impact. Spectral Bellman Representation offers a principled and effective path toward learning more powerful and structurally sound representations for value-based reinforcement learning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Interpretability can improve the safety, transparency and trust of AI models, which is especially important in healthcare applications where decisions often carry significant consequences. Mechanistic interpretability, particularly through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models. In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range of clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper mechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted multimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model transparency. We release the trained SAEs and interpretations:this https URL.

- **[Are encoders able to learn landmarkers for warm-starting of Hyperparameter Optimization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12604)**  `arXiv:2507.12604`  `cs.LG`  
  _Antoni Zajko, Katarzyna Wo≈∫nica_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effectively representing heterogeneous tabular datasets for meta-learning purposes is still an open problem. Previous approaches rely on representations that are intended to be universal. This paper proposes two novel methods for tabular representation learning tailored to a specific meta-task - warm-starting Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization. Both follow the specific requirement formulated by ourselves that enforces representations to capture the properties of landmarkers. The first approach involves deep metric learning, while the second one is based on landmarkers reconstruction. We evaluate the proposed encoders in two ways. Next to the gain in the target meta-task, we also use the degree of fulfillment of the proposed requirement as the evaluation metric. Experiments demonstrate that while the proposed encoders can effectively learn representations aligned with landmarkers, they may not directly translate to significant performance gains in the meta-task of HPO warm-starting.

  Tabular data is one of the most prevalent and important data formats in real-world applications such as healthcare, finance, and education. However, its effective use in machine learning is often constrained by data scarcity, privacy concerns, and class imbalance. Synthetic tabular data generation has emerged as a powerful solution, leveraging generative models to learn underlying data distributions and produce realistic, privacy-preserving samples. Although this area has seen growing attention, most existing surveys focus narrowly on specific methods (e.g., GANs or privacy-enhancing techniques), lacking a unified and comprehensive view that integrates recent advances such as diffusion models and large language models (LLMs).In this survey, we present a structured and in-depth review of synthetic tabular data generation methods. Specifically, the survey is organized into three core components: (1) Background, which covers the overall generation pipeline, including problem definitions, synthetic tabular data generation methods, post processing, and evaluation; (2) Generation Methods, where we categorize existing approaches into traditional generation methods, diffusion model methods, and LLM-based methods, and compare them in terms of architecture, generation quality, and applicability; and (3) Applications and Challenges, which summarizes practical use cases, highlights common datasets, and discusses open challenges such as heterogeneity, data fidelity, and privacy protection.This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a holistic understanding of the field and to highlight key directions for future work in synthetic tabular data generation.

  Collecting human preference feedback is often expensive, leading recent works to develop principled algorithms to select them more efficiently. However, these works assume that the underlying reward function is linear, an assumption that does not hold in many real-life applications, such as online recommendation and LLM alignment. To address this limitation, we propose Neural-ADB, an algorithm based on the neural contextual dueling bandit framework that provides a principled and practical method for collecting human preference feedback when the underlying latent reward function is non-linear. We theoretically show that when preference feedback follows the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, the worst sub-optimality gap of the policy learned by Neural-ADB decreases at a sub-linear rate as the preference dataset increases. Our experimental results on preference datasets further corroborate the effectiveness of Neural-ADB.

  Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models represent a significant advancement in large language model (LLM) development through their efficient parameter utilization. These models achieve substantial performance improvements at reduced inference costs. However, the deployment of SMoE models faces constraints from extensive memory requirements of expert components in resource-limited environments. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Hierarchical Clustering for Sparsely activated Mixture of Experts (HC-SMoE), a task-agnostic expert merging framework for parameter reduction without retraining. HC-SMoE introduces a novel hierarchical clustering approach based on expert outputs to ensure merging robustness independent of routing decisions. The proposed output-based clustering method enables effective capture of functional relationships between experts for large-scale architectures. We provide theoretical analysis and comprehensive evaluations across multiple zero-shot language tasks to demonstrate HC-SMoE's effectiveness in state-of-the-art models including Qwen and Mixtral. The experimental results validate HC-SMoE's superior performance and practical applicability for real-world deployments.

  Developing precise and computationally efficient traffic accident anticipation system is crucial for contemporary autonomous driving technologies, enabling timely intervention and loss prevention.

Furthermore, we introduce a feature aggregation method that facilitates seamless integration of multimodal inputs through large models (GPT-4o, Long-CLIP), complemented by targeted prompt engineering strategies to produce actionable feedback and standardized accident archives. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, and A3D) validate the superior predictive accuracy, enhanced responsiveness, reduced computational overhead, and improved interpretability of our approach, thus establishing a new benchmark for state-of-the-art performance in traffic accident anticipation.

  This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model. Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++ introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference, it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs, while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

  Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning. However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this, we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0% over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets, respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

  Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4 resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression, namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy, employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process. First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model, which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner. Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

  The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT) annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

  Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds. Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model (3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

  IRSTD (InfraRed Small Target Detection) detects small targets in infrared blurry backgrounds and is essential for various applications. The detection task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities. Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images, employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset of the LangIR dataset, respectively.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However, interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning, along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are available atthis https URL.

  Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text, without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

  Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications including document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores, limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document quality assessment across diverse degradation types.

  Humans naturally share information with those they are connected to, and video has become one of the dominant mediums for communication and expression on the Internet. To support the creation of high-quality large-scale video content, a modern pipeline requires a comprehensive understanding of both the raw input materials (e.g., the unedited footage captured by cameras) and the editing components (e.g., visual effects). In video editing scenarios, models must process multiple modalities (e.g., vision, audio, text) with strong background knowledge and handle flexible input lengths (e.g., hour-long raw videos), which poses significant challenges for traditional models. In this report, we introduce Vidi, a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for a wide range of video understand editing scenarios. The first release focuses on temporal retrieval, i.e., identifying the time ranges within the input videos corresponding to a given text query, which plays a critical role in intelligent editing. The model is capable of processing hour-long videos with strong temporal understanding capability, e.g., retrieve time ranges for certain queries. To support a comprehensive evaluation in real-world scenarios, we also present the VUE-TR benchmark, which introduces five key advancements. 1) Video duration: significantly longer than videos of existing temporal retrival datasets, 2) Audio support: includes audio-based queries, 3) Query format: diverse query lengths/formats, 4) Annotation quality: ground-truth time ranges are manually annotated. 5) Evaluation metric: a refined IoU metric to support evaluation over multiple time ranges. Remarkably, Vidi significantly outperforms leading proprietary models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini, on the temporal retrieval task, indicating its superiority in video editing scenarios.

  Visual reasoning (VR), which is crucial in many fields for enabling human-like visual understanding, remains highly challenging. Recently, compositional visual reasoning approaches, which leverage the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) with integrated tools to solve problems, have shown promise as more effective strategies than end-to-end VR methods. However, these approaches face limitations, as frozen LLMs lack tool awareness in VR, leading to performance bottlenecks. While leveraging LLMs for reasoning is widely used in other domains, they are not directly applicable to VR due to limited training data, imperfect tools that introduce errors and reduce data collection efficiency in VR, and challenging in fine-tuning on noisy workflows. To address these challenges, we propose DWIM: i) Discrepancy-aware training Workflow generation, which assesses tool usage and extracts more viable workflows for training; and ii) Instruct-Masking fine-tuning, which guides the model to only clone effective actions, enabling the generation of more practical solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that DWIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various VR tasks, exhibiting strong generalization on multiple widely-used datasets.

  Existing MLLMs encounter significant challenges in modeling the temporal context within long videos. Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our method consists of four key steps: 1) Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2) Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos to improve the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3) Action: Agents answer long video questions and exchange reasons. 4) Reflection: We evaluate each agent's performance in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (like GPT-4o) and open-source models (like InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks. Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80\% on four mainstream long video understanding tasks. Notably, LVAgent improves accuracy by 13.3\% on LongVideoBench. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Prompt optimization is essential for effective utilization of large language models (LLMs) across diverse tasks. While existing optimization methods are effective in optimizing short prompts, they struggle with longer, more complex ones, often risking information loss and being sensitive to small perturbations. To address these challenges, we propose SCULPT (Systematic Tuning of Long Prompts), a framework that treats prompt optimization as a hierarchical tree refinement problem. SCULPT represents prompts as tree structures, enabling targeted modifications while preserving contextual integrity. It employs a Critic-Actor framework that generates reflections and applies actions to refine the prompt. Evaluations demonstrate SCULPT's effectiveness on long prompts, its robustness to adversarial perturbations, and its ability to generate high-performing prompts even without any initial human-written prompt. Compared to existing state of the art methods, SCULPT consistently improves LLM performance by preserving essential task information while applying structured refinements. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses show that SCULPT produces more stable and interpretable prompt modifications, ensuring better generalization across tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs. Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation systems for complex scientific tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method, QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%) on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

  Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities. While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405 multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in Hindi.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents our approach for the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA: Preguntas y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa√±ol (Questions and Answers about Tables in Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task. The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

  Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

  Safety alignment is critical for LLM-powered systems. While recent LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''), they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over 260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases. We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and 18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the overall performance of SEALGuard. We release our pre-trained model and benchmark atthis https URLto support further research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such as scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback: performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of spontaneous self-reflection, and persistent failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and critique-guided self-refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration. Additionally, we employ a shaping function to amplify learning from correct, especially unfamiliar, refinements and penalize incorrect ones. Extensive experiments with Qwen2.5-7B-Base, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, and Qwen3-8B demonstrate that Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning and RL-based fine-tuning methods across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.4% and 3.8% on Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B, respectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO enables effective self-improvement through self-critiquing and weak-to-strong generalization, achieving consistent gains over GRPO, such as 16.7% and 10.0% pass@1 improvements on AIME 2024, respectively.

  Multi-modal large language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot abilities and powerful image-understanding capabilities. However, the existing open-source multi-modal models suffer from the weak capability of multi-turn interaction, especially for long contexts. To address the issue, we first introduce a context modeling module, termed ContextQFormer, which utilizes a memory block to enhance the presentation of contextual information. Furthermore, to facilitate further research, we carefully build a new multi-turn multi-modal dialogue dataset (TMDialog) for pre-training, instruction-tuning, and evaluation, which will be open-sourced lately. Compared with other multi-modal dialogue datasets, TMDialog contains longer conversations, which supports the research of multi-turn multi-modal dialogue. In addition, ContextQFormer is compared with three baselines on TMDialog and experimental results illustrate that ContextQFormer achieves an improvement of 2%-4% in available rate over baselines.

  With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), the issue of generating non-existing facts, known as hallucination, has garnered increasing attention. Previous research in enhancing LLM confidence estimation mainly focuses on the single problem setting. However, LLM awareness of its internal parameterized knowledge boundary under the more challenging multi-problem setting, which requires answering multiple problems accurately simultaneously, remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel method, Multiple Answers and Confidence Stepwise Tuning (MAC-Tuning), that separates the learning of answer prediction and confidence estimation during fine-tuning on instruction data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines by up to 25% in average precision.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unstructured clinical data can serve as a unique and rich source of information that can meaningfully inform clinical practice. Extracting the most pertinent context from such data is critical for exploiting its true potential toward optimal and timely decision-making in patient care. While prior research has explored various methods for clinical text summarization, most prior studies either process all input tokens uniformly or rely on heuristic-based filters, which can overlook nuanced clinical cues and fail to prioritize information critical for decision-making. In this study, we propose Contextual, a novel framework that integrates a Context-Preserving Token Filtering method with a Domain-Specific Knowledge Graph (KG) for contextual augmentation. By preserving context-specific important tokens and enriching them with structured knowledge, ConTextual improves both linguistic coherence and clinical fidelity. Our extensive empirical evaluations on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConTextual consistently outperforms other baselines. Our proposed approach highlights the complementary role of token-level filtering and structured retrieval in enhancing both linguistic and clinical integrity, as well as offering a scalable solution for improving precision in clinical text generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the realm of large language models (LLMs), the ability of models to accurately follow instructions is paramount as more agents and applications leverage LLMs for construction, where the complexity of instructions are rapidly increasing. However, on the one hand, there is only a certain amount of complex instruction evaluation data; on the other hand, there are no dedicated algorithms to improve the ability to follow complex instructions. To this end, this paper introduces TRACE, a benchmark for improving and evaluating the complex instructionfollowing ability, which consists of 120K training data and 1K evaluation data. Furthermore, we propose IOPO (Input-Output Preference Optimization) alignment method which takes both input and output preference pairs into consideration, where LLMs not only rapidly align with response preferences but also meticulously explore the instruction preferences. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and outof-domain datasets confirm the effectiveness of IOPO, showing 8.15%, 2.18% improvements on in-domain data and 6.29%, 3.13% on outof-domain data compared to SFT and DPO respectively.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The success of multi-task learning can depend heavily on which tasks are grouped together. Naively grouping all tasks or a random set of tasks can result in negative transfer, with the multi-task models performing worse than single-task models. Though many efforts have been made to identify task groupings and to measure the relatedness among different tasks, it remains a challenging research topic to define a metric to identify the best task grouping out of a pool of many potential task combinations. We propose a metric of task relatedness based on task difficulty measured by pointwise V-usable information (PVI). PVI is a recently proposed metric to estimate how much usable information a dataset contains given a model. We hypothesize that tasks with not statistically different PVI estimates are similar enough to benefit from the joint learning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the feasibility of this metric for task grouping on 15 NLP datasets in the general, biomedical, and clinical domains. We compare the results of the joint learners against single learners, existing baseline methods, and recent large language models, including Llama 2 and GPT-4. The results show that by grouping tasks with similar PVI estimates, the joint learners yielded competitive results with fewer total parameters, with consistent performance across domains.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs are ideal for decision-making thanks to their ability to reason over long contexts. However, challenges arise when processing speech transcripts that describe complex scenarios, as they are verbose and include repetition, hedging, and vagueness. E.g., during a company's earnings call, an executive might project a positive revenue outlook to reassure investors, despite uncertainty regarding future earnings. It is crucial for LLMs to incorporate this uncertainty systematically when making decisions. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{DeFine}, a modular framework that constructs probabilistic factor profiles from complex scenarios. It then integrates these profiles with analogical reasoning, leveraging insights from similar past experiences to guide LLMs in making critical decisions in new situations. Our framework separates the tasks of quantifying uncertainty and incorporating it into LLM decision-making. This approach is particularly useful in areas such as consulting and financial deliberation, where making decisions under uncertainty is vital.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life, whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on short pun-based jokes. In this work, we investigate whether the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour form. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns, contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on reasoning beyond "common sense", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly simple joke forms.

  The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components: context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs. Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately, this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers advancing context-aware AI.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and 18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1. The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine, instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers. This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of LLM reasoning from synthetic data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging pretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen tasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context learning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it still faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and lower computational costs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the sources of variability in annotations is crucial for developing fair NLP systems, especially for tasks like sexism detection where demographic bias is a concern. This study investigates the extent to which annotator demographic features influence labeling decisions compared to text content. Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we quantify this inf luence, finding that while statistically present, demographic factors account for a minor fraction ( 8%) of the observed variance, with tweet content being the dominant factor. We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models as annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic personas improves alignment with human judgments. Our results indicate that simplistic persona prompting often fails to enhance, and sometimes degrades, performance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI) techniques reveal that model predictions rely heavily on content-specific tokens related to sexism, rather than correlates of demographic characteristics. We argue that focusing on content-driven explanations and robust annotation protocols offers a more reliable path towards fairness than potentially persona simulation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This Ph.D. proposal introduces a plan to develop a computational framework to identify Self-aspects in text. The Self is a multifaceted construct and it is reflected in language. While it is described across disciplines like cognitive science and phenomenology, it remains underexplored in natural language processing (NLP). Many of the aspects of the Self align with psychological and other well-researched phenomena (e.g., those related to mental health), highlighting the need for systematic NLP-based analysis. In line with this, we plan to introduce an ontology of Self-aspects and a gold-standard annotated dataset. Using this foundation, we will develop and evaluate conventional discriminative models, generative large language models, and embedding-based retrieval approaches against four main criteria: interpretability, ground-truth adherence, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Top-performing models will be applied in case studies in mental health and empirical phenomenology.

  Despite rapid adoption of autoregressive large language models, smaller text encoders still play an important role in text understanding tasks that require rich contextualized representations. Negation is an important semantic function that is still not properly captured by such methods, affecting many downstream applications relying on text embeddings. We propose a strategy to improve negation robustness of text encoders, by distilling data from large language models using diverse patterns of negation and hedging. We adopt a standard contrastive learning strategy to finetune a strong BERT-based model, and observe large improvement in negation understanding capabilities while maintaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. In addition, we also show that our method can be adapted to LLMs, leading to improved performance on negation benchmarks.

  This study proposes a method to improve the performance of Werewolf agents by switching between predefined strategies based on the attitudes of other players and the context of conversations. While prior works of Werewolf agents using prompt engineering have employed methods where effective strategies are implicitly defined, they cannot adapt to changing situations. In this research, we propose a method that explicitly selects an appropriate strategy based on the game context and the estimated roles of other players. We compare the strategy adaptation Werewolf agents with baseline agents using implicit or fixed strategies and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

  We present TransEvalnia, a prompting-based translation evaluation and ranking system that uses reasoning in performing its evaluations and ranking. This system presents fine-grained evaluations based on a subset of the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (this https URL), returns an assessment of which translation it deems the best, and provides numerical scores for the various dimensions and for the overall translation. We show that TransEvalnia performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker (Moosa et al. 2024) on our own English-Japanese data as well as several language pairs from various WMT shared tasks. Using Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet and Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct as the evaluation LLMs, we show that the evaluations returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters, and that the scores assigned to the translations by Sonnet, as well as other LLMs, correlate well with scores assigned by the human raters. We also note the sensitivity of our system -- as well as MT-Ranker -- to the order in which the translations are presented, and we propose methods to address this position bias. All data, including the system's evaluation and reasoning, human assessments, as well as code is released.

  The following paper introduces a general linguistic creativity test for humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). The test consists of various tasks aimed at assessing their ability to generate new original words and phrases based on word formation processes (derivation and compounding) and on metaphorical language use. We administered the test to 24 humans and to an equal number of LLMs, and we automatically evaluated their answers using OCSAI tool for three criteria: Originality, Elaboration, and Flexibility. The results show that LLMs not only outperformed humans in all the assessed criteria, but did better in six out of the eight test tasks. We then computed the uniqueness of the individual answers, which showed some minor differences between humans and LLMs. Finally, we performed a short manual analysis of the dataset, which revealed that humans are more inclined towards E(extending)-creativity, while LLMs favor F(ixed)-creativity.

  Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate: (1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit \textit{hallucinations}, generating factually incorrect or semantically irrelevant content in response to prompts. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can mitigate hallucinations by encouraging step-by-step reasoning, but its impact on hallucination detection remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of various detection methods. Our study highlights an overlooked trade-off in the use of reasoning. Code is publicly available at:this https URL.

  Visual-language Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data resources are relatively scarce compared to text-only counterparts, limiting the improvement of reasoning capabilities in Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, high-quality vision-language reasoning data is expensive and labor-intensive to annotate. To address this issue, we leverage a promising resource: game code, which naturally contains logical structures and state transition processes. Therefore, we propose Code2Logic, a novel game-code-driven approach for multimodal reasoning data synthesis. Our approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt game code, enabling automatic acquisition of reasoning processes and results through code execution. Using the Code2Logic approach, we developed the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is cost-effective and scalable, offers controllable difficulty gradation and is diverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Surprisingly, despite training solely on game data, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization, specifically Qwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33% across 7 diverse vision-language benchmarks. Our code, dataset and models are available atthis https URL.

  Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face challenges in enterprise settings due to limited retrieval scope and data security risks. When relevant internal documents are unavailable, the system struggles to generate accurate and complete responses. Additionally, using closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about exposing proprietary information. To address these issues, we propose the Secure Multifaceted-RAG (SecMulti-RAG) framework, which retrieves not only from internal documents but also from two supplementary sources: pre-generated expert knowledge for anticipated queries and on-demand external LLM-generated knowledge. To mitigate security risks, we adopt a local open-source generator and selectively utilize external LLMs only when prompts are deemed safe by a filtering mechanism. This approach enhances completeness, prevents data leakage, and reduces costs. In our evaluation on a report generation task in the automotive industry, SecMulti-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG - achieving 79.3 to 91.9 percent win rates across correctness, richness, and helpfulness in LLM-based evaluation, and 56.3 to 70.4 percent in human evaluation. This highlights SecMulti-RAG as a practical and secure solution for enterprise RAG.

  Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation, automating programming with remarkable efficiency. However, these advancements challenge programming skills, ethics, and assessment integrity, making the detection of LLM-generated code essential for maintaining accountability and standards. While, there has been some research on this problem, it generally lacks domain coverage and robustness, and only covers a small number of programming languages. To this end, we propose a framework capable of distinguishing between human- and LLM-written code across multiple programming languages, code generators, and domains. We use a large-scale dataset from renowned platforms and LLM-based code generators, alongside applying rigorous data quality checks, feature engineering, and comparative analysis using evaluation of traditional machine learning models, pre-trained language models (PLMs), and LLMs for code detection. We perform an evaluation on out-of-domain scenarios, such as detecting the authorship and hybrid authorship of generated code and generalizing to unseen models, domains, and programming languages. Moreover, our extensive experiments show that our framework effectively distinguishes human- from LLM-written code and sets a new benchmark for this task.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Synthetic data offers a promising path to train models while preserving data privacy. Differentially private (DP) finetuning of large language models (LLMs) as data generator is effective, but is impractical when computation resources are limited. Meanwhile, prompt-based methods such as private evolution depend heavily on the manual prompts, and ineffectively use private information in their iterative data selection process. To overcome these limitations, we propose CTCL (Data Synthesis with ConTrollability and CLustering), a novel framework for generating privacy-preserving synthetic data without extensive prompt engineering or billion-scale LLM finetuning. CTCL pretrains a lightweight 140M conditional generator and a clustering-based topic model on large-scale public data. To further adapt to the private domain, the generator is DP finetuned on private data for fine-grained textual information, while the topic model extracts a DP histogram representing distributional information. The DP generator then samples according to the DP histogram to synthesize a desired number of data examples. Evaluation across five diverse domains demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in the strong privacy regime. Systematic ablation validates the design of each framework component and highlights the scalability of our approach.

  In this work, we introduce a new hallucination metric - Simple Hallucination Index (SHI) and provide insight into one important limitation of the parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs), i.e. false attribution. The task of automatic author attribution for relatively small chunks of text is an important NLP task but can be challenging. We empirically evaluate the power of 3 open SotA LLMs in zero-shot setting (Gemma-7B, Mixtral 8x7B, and LLaMA-2-13B). We acquired the top 10 most popular books of a month, according to Project Gutenberg, divided each one into equal chunks of 400 words, and prompted each LLM to predict the author. We then randomly sampled 162 chunks per book for human evaluation, based on the error margin of 7% and a confidence level of 95%. The average results show that Mixtral 8x7B has the highest prediction accuracy, the lowest SHI, and a Pearson's correlation (r) of 0.724, 0.263, and -0.9996, respectively, followed by LLaMA-2-13B and Gemma-7B. However, Mixtral 8x7B suffers from high hallucinations for 3 books, rising as high as a SHI of 0.87 (in the range 0-1, where 1 is the worst). The strong negative correlation of accuracy and SHI, given by r, demonstrates the fidelity of the new hallucination metric, which may generalize to other tasks. We also show that prediction accuracies correlate positively with the frequencies of Wikipedia instances of the book titles instead of the downloads and we perform error analyses of predictions. We publicly release the annotated chunks of data and our codes to aid the reproducibility and evaluation of other models.

  Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) aims to detect stances toward unseen targets. Incorporating background knowledge to enhance transferability between seen and unseen targets constitutes the primary approach of ZSSD. However, these methods often struggle with a knowledge-task disconnect and lack logical consistency in their predictions. To address these issues, we introduce a novel approach named Logically Consistent Chain-of-Thought (LC-CoT) for ZSSD, which improves stance detection by ensuring relevant and logically sound knowledge extraction. LC-CoT employs a three-step process. Initially, it assesses whether supplementary external knowledge is necessary. Subsequently, it uses API calls to retrieve this knowledge, which can be processed by a separate LLM. Finally, a manual exemplar guides the LLM to infer stance categories, using an if-then logical structure to maintain relevance and logical coherence. This structured approach to eliciting background knowledge enhances the model's capability, outperforming traditional supervised methods without relying on labeled data.

  The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement, current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured, individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and effective systems for teaching mathematics.

  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, \emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical reasoning.

  The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models. The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented, showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived quality of the responses that justifies their use.

This paper presents our solution for the NLPCC 2025 Task 8 ESC evaluation, where we leverage large-scale language models enhanced by prompt engineering and finetuning techniques. We explore both parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation and full-parameter fine-tuning strategies to improve the model's ability to generate supportive and contextually appropriate responses. Our best model ranked second in the competition, highlighting the potential of combining LLMs with effective adaptation methods for ESC tasks. Future work will focus on further enhancing emotional understanding and response personalization to build more practical and reliable emotional support systems.

  The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs) necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness, corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally salient contexts.

  Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems. However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation, assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and (3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective foundation for multi-agent collaboration.

  The gap between static benchmarks and the dynamic nature of real-world legal practice poses a key barrier to advancing legal intelligence. To this end, we introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework, designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o, falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights to guide future research.

  LLM-as-Judge has emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation, enabling large language models (LLMs) to provide reward signals in trainings. While recent work has explored multi-agent extensions such as multi-agent debate and meta-judging to enhance evaluation quality, the question of how intrinsic biases manifest in these settings remains underexplored. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of four diverse bias types: position bias, verbosity bias, chain-of-thought bias, and bandwagon bias. We evaluate these biases across two widely adopted multi-agent LLM-as-Judge frameworks: Multi-Agent-Debate and LLM-as-Meta-Judge. Our results show that debate framework amplifies biases sharply after the initial debate, and this increased bias is sustained in subsequent rounds, while meta-judge approaches exhibit greater resistance. We further investigate the incorporation of PINE, a leading single-agent debiasing method, as a bias-free agent within these systems. The results reveal that this bias-free agent effectively reduces biases in debate settings but provides less benefit in meta-judge scenarios. Our work provides a comprehensive study of bias behavior in multi-agent LLM-as-Judge systems and highlights the need for targeted bias mitigation strategies in collaborative evaluation settings.
