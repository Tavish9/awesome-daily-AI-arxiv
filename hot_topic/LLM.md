- **[EMMOE: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Embodied Mobile Manipulation in Open Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08604)**  `arXiv:2503.08604`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Developing autonomous home robots controlled by natural language has long been a pursuit of humanity. While advancements in large language models (LLMs) and embodied intelligence make this goal closer, several challenges persist: the lack of a unified benchmark for more complex robot tasks, limited evaluation methods and metrics, data incompatibility between LLMs and mobile manipulation trajectories. To address these issues, we propose Embodied Mobile Manipulation in Open Environments (EMMOE), a benchmark that requires agents to interpret user instructions and execute long-horizon everyday tasks in continuous space. EMMOE seamlessly integrates high-level and low-level embodied tasks into a unified framework, along with three new metrics for more diverse assessment. Additionally, we collect~\dataset, which features in various task attributes, detailed process annotations, re-plans after failures, and two sub-datasets for LLM training. Furthermore, we design~\model, a sophisticated agent system consists of LLM with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), light weighted navigation and manipulation models, and multiple error detection mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate~\model's performance and evaluations of different models and policies.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) show growing promise in autonomous driving by reasoning over complex traffic scenarios to generate path plans. However, their tendencies toward overconfidence, and hallucinations raise critical safety concerns. We introduce SafePath, a modular framework that augments LLM-based path planning with formal safety guarantees using conformal prediction. SafePath operates in three stages. In the first stage, we use an LLM that generates a set of diverse candidate paths, exploring possible trajectories based on agent behaviors and environmental cues. In the second stage, SafePath filters out high-risk trajectories while guaranteeing that at least one safe option is included with a user-defined probability, through a multiple-choice question-answering formulation that integrates conformal prediction. In the final stage, our approach selects the path with the lowest expected collision risk when uncertainty is low or delegates control to a human when uncertainty is high. We theoretically prove that SafePath guarantees a safe trajectory with a user-defined probability, and we show how its human delegation rate can be tuned to balance autonomy and safety. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Highway-env show that SafePath reduces planning uncertainty by 77\% and collision rates by up to 70\%, demonstrating effectiveness in making LLM-driven path planning more safer.

- **[Scaling Laws for Black box Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16782)**  `arXiv:2411.16782`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Chuan Liu, Huanran Chen, Yichi Zhang, Yinpeng Dong, Jun Zhu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adversarial examples usually exhibit good cross-model transferability, enabling attacks on black-box models with limited information about their architectures and parameters, which are highly threatening in commercial black-box scenarios. Model ensembling is an effective strategy to improve the transferability of adversarial examples by attacking multiple surrogate models. However, since prior studies usually adopt few models in the ensemble, there remains an open question of whether scaling the number of models can further improve black-box attacks. Inspired by the scaling law of large foundation models, we investigate the scaling laws of black-box adversarial attacks in this work. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, we conclude with clear scaling laws that using more surrogate models enhances adversarial transferability. Comprehensive experiments verify the claims on standard image classifiers, diverse defended models and multimodal large language models using various adversarial attack methods. Specifically, by scaling law, we achieve 90%+ transfer attack success rate on even proprietary models like GPT-4o. Further visualization indicates that there is also a scaling law on the interpretability and semantics of adversarial perturbations.

- **[RouteNator: A Router-Based Multi-Modal Architecture for Generating Synthetic Training Data for Function Calling LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10495)**  `arXiv:2505.10495`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for function calling tasks when real user interaction data is unavailable. In digital content creation tools, where users express their needs through natural language queries that must be mapped to API calls, the lack of real-world task-specific data and privacy constraints for training on it necessitate synthetic data generation. Existing approaches to synthetic data generation fall short in diversity and complexity, failing to replicate real-world data distributions and leading to suboptimal performance after LLM fine-tuning. We present a novel router-based architecture that leverages domain resources like content metadata and structured knowledge graphs, along with text-to-text and vision-to-text language models to generate high-quality synthetic training data. Our architecture's flexible routing mechanism enables synthetic data generation that matches observed real-world distributions, addressing a fundamental limitation of traditional approaches. Evaluation on a comprehensive set of real user queries demonstrates significant improvements in both function classification accuracy and API parameter selection. Models fine-tuned with our synthetic data consistently outperform traditional approaches, establishing new benchmarks for function calling tasks.

- **[Learning Virtual Machine Scheduling in Cloud Computing through Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10117)**  `arXiv:2505.10117`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _JieHao Wu, Ziwei Wang, Junjie Sheng, Wenhao Li, Xiangfei Wang, Jun Luo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In cloud services, virtual machine (VM) scheduling is a typical Online Dynamic Multidimensional Bin Packing (ODMBP) problem, characterized by large-scale complexity and fluctuating demands. Traditional optimization methods struggle to adapt to real-time changes, domain-expert-designed heuristic approaches suffer from rigid strategies, and existing learning-based methods often lack generalizability and interpretability. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hierarchical language agent framework named MiCo, which provides a large language model (LLM)-driven heuristic design paradigm for solving ODMBP. Specifically, ODMBP is formulated as a Semi-Markov Decision Process with Options (SMDP-Option), enabling dynamic scheduling through a two-stage architecture, i.e., Option Miner and Option Composer. Option Miner utilizes LLMs to discover diverse and useful non-context-aware strategies by interacting with constructed environments. Option Composer employs LLMs to discover a composing strategy that integrates the non-context-aware strategies with the contextual ones. Extensive experiments on real-world enterprise datasets demonstrate that MiCo achieves a 96.9\% competitive ratio in large-scale scenarios involving more than 10,000 virtual machines. It maintains high performance even under nonstationary request flows and diverse configurations, thus validating its effectiveness in complex and large-scale cloud environments.

- **[Superposition Yields Robust Neural Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10465)**  `arXiv:2505.10465`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this neural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model size -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs represent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e., representations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur with varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss scaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only the most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of loss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature frequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong superposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other, the loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide range of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is explained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower dimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales inversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced LLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match the predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also agree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an important mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws. We anticipate that these insights will inspire new training strategies and model architectures to achieve better performance with less computation and fewer parameters.

  Reinforcement Learning (RL) mathematically formulates decision-making with Markov Decision Process (MDP). With MDPs, researchers have achieved remarkable breakthroughs across various domains, including games, robotics, and language models. This paper seeks a new possibility, Natural Language Reinforcement Learning (NLRL), by extending traditional MDP to natural language-based representation space. Specifically, NLRL innovatively redefines RL principles, including task objectives, policy, value function, Bellman equation, and policy iteration, into their language counterparts. With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), NLRL can be practically implemented to achieve RL-like policy and value improvement by either pure prompting or gradient-based training. Experiments over Maze, Breakthrough, and Tic-Tac-Toe games demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and interpretability of the NLRL framework among diverse use cases.

- **[Reinforced Interactive Continual Learning via Real-time Noisy Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09925)**  `arXiv:2505.09925`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yutao Yang, Jie Zhou, Junsong Li, Qianjun Pan, Bihao Zhan, Qin Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces an interactive continual learning paradigm where AI models dynamically learn new skills from real-time human feedback while retaining prior knowledge. This paradigm distinctively addresses two major limitations of traditional continual learning: (1) dynamic model updates using streaming, real-time human-annotated data, rather than static datasets with fixed labels, and (2) the assumption of clean labels, by explicitly handling the noisy feedback common in real-world interactions. To tackle these problems, we propose RiCL, a Reinforced interactive Continual Learning framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn new skills effectively from dynamic feedback. RiCL incorporates three key components: a temporal consistency-aware purifier to automatically discern clean from noisy samples in data streams; an interaction-aware direct preference optimization strategy to align model behavior with human intent by reconciling AI-generated and human-provided feedback; and a noise-resistant contrastive learning module that captures robust representations by exploiting inherent data relationships, thus avoiding reliance on potentially unreliable labels. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (FewRel and TACRED), contaminated with realistic noise patterns, demonstrate that our RiCL approach substantially outperforms existing combinations of state-of-the-art online continual learning and noisy-label learning methods.

- **[Out-of-distribution generalisation is hard: evidence from ARC-like tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09716)**  `arXiv:2505.09716`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _George Dimitriadis. Spyridon Samothrakis_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation is considered a hallmark of human and animal intelligence. To achieve OOD through composition, a system must discover the environment-invariant properties of experienced input-output mappings and transfer them to novel inputs. This can be realised if an intelligent system can identify appropriate, task-invariant, and composable input features, as well as the composition methods, thus allowing it to act based not on the interpolation between learnt data points but on the task-invariant composition of those features. We propose that in order to confirm that an algorithm does indeed learn compositional structures from data, it is not enough to just test on an OOD setup, but one also needs to confirm that the features identified are indeed compositional. We showcase this by exploring two tasks with clearly defined OOD metrics that are not OOD solvable by three commonly used neural networks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Transformer. In addition, we develop two novel network architectures imbued with biases that allow them to be successful in OOD scenarios. We show that even with correct biases and almost perfect OOD performance, an algorithm can still fail to learn the correct features for compositional generalisation.

- **[TSINR: Capturing Temporal Continuity via Implicit Neural Representations for Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11641)**  `arXiv:2411.11641`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Mengxuan Li, Ke Liu, Hongyang Chen, Jiajun Bu, Hongwei Wang, Haishuai Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series anomaly detection aims to identify unusual patterns in data or deviations from systems' expected behavior. The reconstruction-based methods are the mainstream in this task, which learn point-wise representation via unsupervised learning. However, the unlabeled anomaly points in training data may cause these reconstruction-based methods to learn and reconstruct anomalous data, resulting in the challenge of capturing normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a time series anomaly detection method based on implicit neural representation (INR) reconstruction, named TSINR, to address this challenge. Due to the property of spectral bias, TSINR enables prioritizing low-frequency signals and exhibiting poorer performance on high-frequency abnormal data. Specifically, we adopt INR to parameterize time series data as a continuous function and employ a transformer-based architecture to predict the INR of given data. As a result, the proposed TSINR method achieves the advantage of capturing the temporal continuity and thus is more sensitive to discontinuous anomaly data. In addition, we further design a novel form of INR continuous function to learn inter- and intra-channel information, and leverage a pre-trained large language model to amplify the intense fluctuations in anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSINR achieves superior overall performance on both univariate and multivariate time series anomaly detection benchmarks compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods. Our codes are available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inspired by the success of large language models, there is a trend toward developing graph foundation models to conduct diverse downstream tasks in various domains. However, current models often require extra fine-tuning to apply their learned structural and semantic representations to new graphs, which limits their versatility. Recent breakthroughs in zero-shot inductive reasoning on knowledge graphs (KGs), offer us a new perspective on extending KG reasoning to general graph applications. In this paper, we introduce SCR, a unified graph reasoning framework designed to train on knowledge graphs and effectively generalize across a wide range of graph tasks and domains. We begin by designing the task-specific KG structures to establish a unified topology for different task formats. Then we propose semantic-conditioned message passing, a novel mechanism addressing the inherent semantic isolation in traditional KG reasoning, by jointly modeling structural and semantic invariance patterns in graph representations. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we evaluate the inductive reasoning capability of SCR using 38 diverse graph datasets, covering node-level, link-level, and graph-level tasks across multiple domains. Our results show substantial performance gains over existing foundation models and supervised baselines, highlighting the efficacy and adaptability of our approach.

  Effective communication about breast and cervical cancers remains a persistent health challenge, with significant gaps in public understanding of cancer prevention, screening, and treatment, potentially leading to delayed diagnoses and inadequate treatments. This study evaluates the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate, safe, and accessible cancer-related information to support patient understanding. We evaluated five general-purpose and three medical LLMs using a mixed-methods evaluation framework across linguistic quality, safety and trustworthiness, and communication accessibility and affectiveness. Our approach utilized quantitative metrics, qualitative expert ratings, and statistical analysis using Welch's ANOVA, Games-Howell, and Hedges' g. Our results show that general-purpose LLMs produced outputs of higher linguistic quality and affectiveness, while medical LLMs demonstrate greater communication accessibility. However, medical LLMs tend to exhibit higher levels of potential harm, toxicity, and bias, reducing their performance in safety and trustworthiness. Our findings indicate a duality between domain-specific knowledge and safety in health communications. The results highlight the need for intentional model design with targeted improvements, particularly in mitigating harm and bias, and improving safety and affectiveness. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for cancer communication, offering critical insights for improving AI-generated health content and informing future development of accurate, safe, and accessible digital health tools.

- **[Learning to Think: Information-Theoretic Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10425)**  `arXiv:2505.10425`  `cs.LG`  
  _Jingyao Wang, Wenwen Qiang, Zeen Song, Changwen Zheng, Hui Xiong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks thanks to advances in reasoning abilities. However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between reasoning effectiveness and computational efficiency, often encouraging unnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we propose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement fine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning with fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as a hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense process reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in parameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We propose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and the Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly reduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately rewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T optimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each episode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning benchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different tasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency.

  Efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained devices presents significant challenges in compute and memory utilization. Due to limited GPU memory, existing systems offload model weights to CPU memory, incurring substantial I/O overhead between the CPU and GPU. This leads to two major inefficiencies: (1) GPU cores are underutilized, often remaining idle while waiting for data to be loaded; and (2) GPU memory has low impact on performance, as reducing its capacity has minimal effect on overallthis http URLthis paper, we propose SpecOffload, a high-throughput inference engine that embeds speculative decoding into offloading. Our key idea is to unlock latent GPU resources for storing and executing a draft model used for speculative decoding, thus accelerating inference at near-zero additional cost. To support this, we carefully orchestrate the interleaved execution of target and draft models in speculative decoding within the offloading pipeline, and propose a planner to manage tensor placement and select optimal parameters. Compared to the best baseline, SpecOffload improves GPU core utilization by 4.49x and boosts inference throughput by 2.54x. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Conventional forecasting methods rely on unimodal time series data, limiting their ability to exploit rich textual information. Recently, large language models (LLMs) and time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated powerful capability in textual reasoning and temporal modeling, respectively. Integrating the strengths of both to construct a multimodal model that concurrently leverages both temporal and textual information for future inference has emerged as a critical research challenge. To address the scarcity of event-series paired data, we propose a decoupled framework: an LLM is employed to transform textual events into revision instructions, which are then used to steer the output of TSFM. To implement this framework, we introduce ChronoSteer, a multimodal TSFM that can be steered through textual revision instructions, effectively bridging LLM and TSFM. Moreover, to mitigate the shortage of cross-modal instruction-series paired data, we devise a two-stage training strategy based on synthetic data. In addition, we also construct a high-quality multimodal time series forecasting benchmark to address the information leakage concerns during evaluation. After integrating with an LLM, ChronoSteer, which is trained exclusively on synthetic data, achieves a 25.7% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the unimodal backbone and a 22.5% gain over the previous state-of-the-art multimodal method.

  A central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is its dependence on extensive real-world interaction data to learn task-specific policies. While recent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can mitigate this limitation by generating synthetic experience (noted as imaginary rollouts) for mastering novel tasks, progress in this emerging field is hindered due to the lack of a standard benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce ImagineBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating offline RL algorithms that leverage both real rollouts and LLM-imaginary rollouts. The key features of ImagineBench include: (1) datasets comprising environment-collected and LLM-imaginary rollouts; (2) diverse domains of environments covering locomotion, robotic manipulation, and navigation tasks; and (3) natural language task instructions with varying complexity levels to facilitate language-conditioned policy learning. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms, we observe that simply applying existing offline RL algorithms leads to suboptimal performance on unseen tasks, achieving 35.44% success rate in hard tasks in contrast to 64.37% of method training on real rollouts for hard tasks. This result highlights the need for algorithm advancements to better leverage LLM-imaginary rollouts. Additionally, we identify key opportunities for future research: including better utilization of imaginary rollouts, fast online adaptation and continual learning, and extension to multi-modal tasks.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used, understanding them systematically is key to improving their safety and realizing their full potential. Although many models are aligned using techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), they are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. Some of the existing adversarial attack methods search for discrete tokens that may jailbreak a target model while others try to optimize the continuous space represented by the tokens of the model's vocabulary. While techniques based on the discrete space may prove to be inefficient, optimization of continuous token embeddings requires projections to produce discrete tokens, which might render them ineffective. To fully utilize the constraints and the structures of the space, we develop an intrinsic optimization technique using exponentiated gradient descent with the Bregman projection method to ensure that the optimized one-hot encoding always stays within the probability simplex. We prove the convergence of the technique and implement an efficient algorithm that is effective in jailbreaking several widely used LLMs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique using five open-source LLMs on four openly available datasets. The results show that the technique achieves a higher success rate with great efficiency compared to three other state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques.

  _Daniel Waddington, Cornel Constantinescu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  During the training of Large Language Models (LLMs), tensor data is periodically "checkpointed" to persistent storage to allow recovery of work done in the event of failure. The volume of data that must be copied during each checkpoint, even when using reduced-precision representations such as bfloat16, often reaches hundreds of gigabytes. Furthermore, the data must be moved across a network and written to a storage system before the next epoch occurs. With a view to ultimately building an optimized checkpointing solution, this paper presents experimental analysis of checkpoint data used to derive a design that maximizes the use of lossless compression to reduce the volume of data. We examine how tensor data and its compressibility evolve during model training and evaluate the efficacy of existing common off-the-shelf general purpose compression engines combined with known data optimization techniques such as byte-grouping and incremental delta compression.Leveraging our analysis we have built an effective compression solution, known as Language Model Compressor (LMC), which is based on byte-grouping and Huffman encoding. LMC offers more compression performance than the best alternative (BZ2) but with an order-of-magnitude reduction in the time needed to perform the compression. We show that a 16-core parallel implementation of LMC can attain compression and decompression throughput of 2.78 GiB/s and 3.76 GiB/s respectively. This increase in performance ultimately reduces the CPU resources needed and provides more time to copy the data to the storage system before the next epoch thus allowing for higher-frequency checkpoints.

  Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) is a promising compute paradigm to improve speed and power efficiency of neural network inference beyond the limits of conventional von Neumann-based architectures. However, AIMC introduces fundamental challenges such as noisy computations and strict constraints on input and output quantization. Because of these constraints and imprecisions, off-the-shelf LLMs are not able to achieve 4-bit-level performance when deployed on AIMC-based hardware. While researchers previously investigated recovering this accuracy gap on small, mostly vision-based models, a generic method applicable to LLMs pre-trained on trillions of tokens does not yet exist. In this work, we introduce a general and scalable method to robustly adapt LLMs for execution on noisy, low-precision analog hardware. Our approach enables state-of-the-art models $\unicode{x2013}$ including Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct $\unicode{x2013}$ to retain performance comparable to 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation baselines, despite the presence of analog noise and quantization constraints. Additionally, we show that as a byproduct of our training methodology, analog foundation models can be quantized for inference on low-precision digital hardware. Finally, we show that our models also benefit from test-time compute scaling, showing better scaling behavior than models trained with 4-bit weight and 8-bit static input quantization. Our work bridges the gap between high-capacity LLMs and efficient analog hardware, offering a path toward energy-efficient foundation models. Code is available atthis https URL.

- **[LAS: Loss-less ANN-SNN Conversion for Fully Spike-Driven Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09659)**  `arXiv:2505.09659`  `cs.LG`  
  _Long Chen, Xiaotian Song, Yanan Sun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spiking Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as an energy-efficient alternative to conventional LLMs through their event-driven computation. To effectively obtain spiking LLMs, researchers develop different ANN-to-SNN conversion methods by leveraging pre-trained ANN parameters while inheriting the energy efficiency of SNN. However, existing conversion methods struggle with extreme activation outliers and incompatible nonlinear operations of ANN-based LLMs. To address this, we propose a loss-less ANN-SNN conversion for fully spike-driven LLMs, termed LAS. Specifically, LAS introduces two novel neurons to convert the activation outlier and nonlinear operation of ANN-based LLMs. Moreover, LAS tailors the spike-equivalent Transformer components for spiking LLMs, which can ensure full spiking conversion without any loss of performance. Experimental results on six language models and two vision-language models demonstrate that LAS achieves loss-less conversion. Notably, on OPT-66B, LAS even improves the accuracy of 2\% on the WSC task. In addition, the parameter and ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of LAS.

  The primary goal of my Ph.D. study is to develop provably efficient and practical algorithms for data-driven sequential decision-making under uncertainty. My work focuses on reinforcement learning (RL), multi-armed bandits, and their applications, including recommendation systems, computer networks, video analytics, and large language models (LLMs). Sequential decision-making methods, such as bandits and RL, have demonstrated remarkable success - ranging from outperforming human players in complex games like Atari and Go to advancing robotics, recommendation systems, and fine-tuning LLMs. Despite these successes, many established algorithms rely on idealized models that can fail under model misspecifications or adversarial perturbations, particularly in settings where accurate prior knowledge of the underlying model class is unavailable or where malicious users operate within dynamic systems. These challenges are pervasive in real-world applications, where robust and adaptive solutions are critical. Furthermore, while worst-case guarantees provide theoretical reliability, they often fail to capture instance-dependent performance, which can lead to more efficient and practical solutions. Another key challenge lies in generalizing to new, unseen environments, a crucial requirement for deploying these methods in dynamic and unpredictable settings. To address these limitations, my research aims to develop more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable sequential decision-making algorithms for both reinforcement learning and bandits. Towards this end, I focus on developing more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable for both general reinforcement learning (RL) and bandits.

  Log data provides crucial insights for tasks like monitoring, root cause analysis, and anomaly detection. Due to the vast volume of logs, automated log parsing is essential to transform semi-structured log messages into structured representations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced the new research field of LLM-based log parsing. Despite promising results, there is no structured overview of the approaches in this relatively new research field with the earliest advances published in late 2023. This work systematically reviews 29 LLM-based log parsing methods. We benchmark seven of them on public datasets and critically assess their comparability and the reproducibility of their reported results. Our findings summarize the advances of this new research field, with insights on how to report results, which data sets, metrics and which terminology to use, and which inconsistencies to avoid, with code and results made publicly available for transparency.

  Existing visual token pruning methods target prompt alignment and visual preservation with static strategies, overlooking the varying relative importance of these objectives across tasks, which leads to inconsistent performance. To address this, we derive the first closed-form error bound for visual token pruning based on the Hausdorff distance, uniformly characterizing the contributions of both objectives. Moreover, leveraging $\epsilon$-covering theory, we reveal an intrinsic trade-off between these objectives and quantify their optimal attainment levels under a fixed budget. To practically handle this trade-off, we propose Multi-Objective Balanced Covering (MoB), which reformulates visual token pruning as a bi-objective covering problem. In this framework, the attainment trade-off reduces to budget allocation via greedy radius trading. MoB offers a provable performance bound and linear scalability with respect to the number of input visual tokens, enabling adaptation to challenging pruning scenarios. Extensive experiments show that MoB preserves 96.4% of performance for LLaVA-1.5-7B using only 11.1% of the original visual tokens and accelerates LLaVA-Next-7B by 1.3-1.5$\times$ with negligible performance loss. Additionally, evaluations on Qwen2-VL and Video-LLaVA confirm that MoB integrates seamlessly into advanced MLLMs and diverse vision-language tasks.

  Natural language image-caption datasets, widely used for training Large Multimodal Models, mainly focus on natural scenarios and overlook the intricate details of mathematical figures that are critical for problem-solving, hindering the advancement of current LMMs in multimodal mathematical reasoning. To this end, we propose leveraging code as supervision for cross-modal alignment, since code inherently encodes all information needed to generate corresponding figures, establishing a precise connection between the two modalities. Specifically, we co-develop our image-to-code model and dataset with model-in-the-loop approach, resulting in an image-to-code model, FigCodifier and ImgCode-8.6M dataset, the largest image-code dataset to date. Furthermore, we utilize FigCodifier to synthesize novel mathematical figures and then construct MM-MathInstruct-3M, a high-quality multimodal math instruction fine-tuning dataset. Finally, we present MathCoder-VL, trained with ImgCode-8.6M for cross-modal alignment and subsequently fine-tuned on MM-MathInstruct-3M for multimodal math problem solving. Our model achieves a new open-source SOTA across all six metrics. Notably, it surpasses GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the geometry problem-solving subset of MathVista, achieving improvements of 8.9% and 9.2%. The dataset and models will be released atthis https URL.

  _Yiwen Liu, Jessica Bader, Jae Myung Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the development of photorealistic diffusion models, models trained in part or fully on synthetic data achieve progressively better results. However, diffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in reality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture artifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a synthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic images containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered infeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered out-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a model's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be excluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility really matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is necessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers, focusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We introduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to include feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated by a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally affects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference in top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute matters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the classification performance. Finally, mixing feasible and infeasible images in training datasets does not significantly impact performance compared to using purely feasible or infeasible datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper evaluates the performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in the low-resource Pashto language. Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Pashto faces several challenges due to the cursive nature of its script and a scarcity of structured datasets. To address this, we developed a synthetic Pashto OCR dataset, PsOCR, consisting of one million images annotated with bounding boxes at word, line, and document levels, suitable for training and evaluating models based on different architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. PsOCR covers variations across 1,000 unique font families, colors, image sizes, and layouts. A benchmark subset of 10K images was selected to evaluate the performance of several LMMs, including seven open-source models: DeepSeek's Janus, InternVL, MiniCPM, Florence, and Qwen (3B and 7B), and four closed-source models: GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, and Grok. Experimental results demonstrate that Gemini achieves the best performance among all models, whereas among open-source models, Qwen-7B stands out. This work provides an insightful assessment of the capabilities and limitations of current LMMs for OCR tasks in Pashto and establishes a foundation for further research not only in Pashto OCR but also for other similar scripts such as Arabic, Persian, and Urdu. PsOCR is available atthis https URL.

  Rapid information access is vital during wildfires, yet traditional data sources are slow and costly. Social media offers real-time updates, but extracting relevant insights remains a challenge. We present WildFireCan-MMD, a new multimodal dataset of X posts from recent Canadian wildfires, annotated across twelve key themes. Evaluating both vision-language models and custom-trained classifiers, we show that while zero-shot prompting offers quick deployment, even simple trained models outperform them when labelled data is available. Our best-performing transformer-based fine-tuned model reaches 83% f-score, outperforming gpt4 by 23%. As a use case, we demonstrate how this model can be used to uncover trends during wildfires. Our findings highlight the enduring importance of tailored datasets and task-specific training. Importantly, such datasets should be localized, as disaster response requirements vary across regions and contexts.

  Existing vision tokenization isolates the optimization of vision tokenizers from downstream training, implicitly assuming the visual tokens can generalize well across various tasks, e.g., image generation and visual question answering. The vision tokenizer optimized for low-level reconstruction is agnostic to downstream tasks requiring varied representations and semantics. This decoupled paradigm introduces a critical misalignment: The loss of the vision tokenization can be the representation bottleneck for target tasks. For example, errors in tokenizing text in a given image lead to poor results when recognizing or generating them. To address this, we propose ETT, an end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning approach that enables joint optimization between vision tokenization and target autoregressive tasks. Unlike prior autoregressive models that use only discrete indices from a frozen vision tokenizer, ETT leverages the visual embeddings of the tokenizer codebook, and optimizes the vision tokenizers end-to-end with both reconstruction and caption objectives. ETT can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines with minimal architecture modifications. Our ETT is simple to implement and integrate, without the need to adjust the original codebooks or architectures of the employed large language models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning unlocks significant performance gains, i.e., 2-6% for multimodal understanding and visual generation tasks compared to frozen tokenizer baselines, while preserving the original reconstruction capability. We hope this very simple and strong method can empower multimodal foundation models besides image generation and understanding.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements have enhanced the capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to comprehend multi-image information. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate answer correctness, overlooking whether models genuinely comprehend the visual input. To address this, we define implicit visual misunderstanding (IVM), where MLLMs provide correct answers without fully comprehending the visual input. Through our analysis, we decouple the visual and textual modalities within the causal attention module, revealing that attention distribution increasingly converges on the image associated with the correct answer as the network layers deepen. This insight leads to the introduction of a scale-agnostic metric, \textit{attention accuracy}, and a novel benchmark for quantifying IVMs. Attention accuracy directly evaluates the model's visual understanding via internal mechanisms, remaining robust to positional biases for more reliable assessments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to finer granularities and demonstrate its effectiveness in unimodal scenarios, underscoring its versatility and generalizability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper does not describe a new method; instead, it provides a thorough exploration of an important yet understudied design space related to recent advances in text-to-image synthesis -- specifically, the deep fusion of large language models (LLMs) and diffusion transformers (DiTs) for multi-modal generation. Previous studies mainly focused on overall system performance rather than detailed comparisons with alternative methods, and key design details and training recipes were often left undisclosed. These gaps create uncertainty about the real potential of this approach. To fill these gaps, we conduct an empirical study on text-to-image generation, performing controlled comparisons with established baselines, analyzing important design choices, and providing a clear, reproducible recipe for training at scale. We hope this work offers meaningful data points and practical guidelines for future research in multi-modal generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to learn new visual concepts from limited examples is a hallmark of human cognition. While traditional category learning models represent each example as an unstructured feature vector, compositional concept learning is thought to depend on (1) structured representations of examples (e.g., directed graphs consisting of objects and their relations) and (2) the identification of shared relational structure across examples through analogical mapping. Here, we introduce Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI), a prototype model that employs deep learning to perform analogical mapping over structured representations of only a handful of examples, forming a compositional concept called a schema. In doing so, PSI relies on a novel conception of similarity that weighs object-level similarity and relational similarity, as well as a mechanism for amplifying relations relevant to classification, analogous to selective attention parameters in traditional models. We show that PSI produces human-like learning performance and outperforms two controls: a prototype model that uses unstructured feature vectors extracted from a deep learning model, and a variant of PSI with weaker structured representations. Notably, we find that PSI's human-like performance is driven by an adaptive strategy that increases relational similarity over object-level similarity and upweights the contribution of relations that distinguish classes. These findings suggest that structured representations and analogical mapping are critical to modeling rapid human-like learning of compositional visual concepts, and demonstrate how deep learning can be leveraged to create psychological models.

  Inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success in eliciting reasoning abilities through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce Video-R1 as the first attempt to systematically explore the R1 paradigm for incentivizing video reasoning within multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, directly applying RL training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-CoT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 37.1% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o.

  Compared to width-wise pruning, depth-wise pruning can significantly accelerate inference in resource-constrained scenarios. However, treating the entire Transformer layer as the minimum pruning unit may degrade model performance by indiscriminately discarding the entire information of the layer. This paper reveals the ``Patch-like'' feature relationship between layers in large language models by analyzing the correlation of the outputs of different layers in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Building on this observation, we propose a sliding layer merging method that dynamically selects and fuses consecutive layers from top to bottom according to a pre-defined similarity threshold, thereby simplifying the model structure while maintaining its performance. Extensive experiments on LLMs with various architectures and different parameter scales show that our method outperforms existing pruning techniques in both zero-shot inference performance and retraining recovery quality after pruning. In particular, in the experiment with 35% pruning on the Vicuna-7B model, our method achieved a 1.654% improvement in average performance on zero-shot tasks compared to the existing method. Moreover, we further reveal the potential of combining depth pruning with width pruning to enhance the pruning effect. Our codes are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. However, when training reasoning models, these approaches are primarily applicable to specific domains such as mathematics and programming, which imposes fundamental constraints on the breadth and scalability of training data. In contrast, continual pretraining (CPT) offers the advantage of not requiring task-specific signals. Nevertheless, how to effectively synthesize training data for reasoning and how such data affect a wide range of domains remain largely unexplored. This study provides a detailed evaluation of Reasoning CPT, a form of CPT that uses synthetic data to reconstruct the hidden thought processes underlying texts, based on the premise that texts are the result of the author's thinking process. Specifically, we apply Reasoning CPT to Gemma2-9B using synthetic data with hidden thoughts derived from STEM and Law corpora, and compare it to standard CPT on the MMLU benchmark. Our analysis reveals that Reasoning CPT consistently improves performance across all evaluated domains. Notably, reasoning skills acquired in one domain transfer effectively to others; the performance gap with conventional methods widens as problem difficulty increases, with gains of up to 8 points on the most challenging problems. Furthermore, models trained with hidden thoughts learn to adjust the depth of their reasoning according to problem difficulty.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely accessible, a detailed understanding of their knowledge within specific domains becomes necessary for successful real world use. This is particularly critical in public health, where failure to retrieve relevant, accurate, and current information could significantly impact UK residents. However, currently little is known about LLM knowledge of UK Government public health information. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new benchmark, PubHealthBench, with over 8000 questions for evaluating LLMs' Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and free form responses to public health queries. To create PubHealthBench we extract free text from 687 current UK government guidance documents and implement an automated pipeline for generating MCQA samples. Assessing 24 LLMs on PubHealthBench we find the latest private LLMs (GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1 and o1) have a high degree of knowledge, achieving >90% accuracy in the MCQA setup, and outperform humans with cursory search engine use. However, in the free form setup we see lower performance with no model scoring >75%. Importantly we find in both setups LLMs have higher accuracy on guidance intended for the general public. Therefore, there are promising signs that state of the art (SOTA) LLMs are an increasingly accurate source of public health information, but additional safeguards or tools may still be needed when providing free form responses on public health topics.

  The reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be improved by structurally denoising their weights, yet existing techniques primarily focus on denoising the feed-forward network (FFN) of the transformer block, and can not efficiently utilise the Multi-head Attention (MHA) block, which is the core of transformer architectures. To address this issue, we propose a novel intuitive framework that, at its very core, performs MHA compression through a multi-head tensorisation process and the Tucker decomposition. This enables both higher-dimensional structured denoising and compression of the MHA weights, by enforcing a shared higher-dimensional subspace across the weights of the multiple attention heads. We demonstrate that this approach consistently enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs across multiple benchmark datasets, and for both encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, while achieving compression rates of up to $\sim 250$ times in the MHA weights, all without requiring any additional data, training, or fine-tuning. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method can be seamlessly combined with existing FFN-only-based denoising techniques to achieve further improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Counterfactual examples are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) as valuable data to improve models, and in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to understand model behavior. The automated generation of counterfactual examples remains a challenging task even for large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance on many tasks. In this paper, we first introduce ZeroCF, a faithful approach for leveraging important words derived from feature attribution methods to generate counterfactual examples in a zero-shot setting. Second, we present a new framework, FitCF, which further verifies aforementioned counterfactuals by label flip verification and then inserts them as demonstrations for few-shot prompting, outperforming two state-of-the-art baselines. Through ablation studies, we identify the importance of each of FitCF's core components in improving the quality of counterfactuals, as assessed through flip rate, perplexity, and similarity measures. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of LIME and Integrated Gradients as backbone attribution methods for FitCF and find that the number of demonstrations has the largest effect on performance. Finally, we reveal a strong correlation between the faithfulness of feature attribution scores and the quality of generated counterfactuals.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely adopted, understanding how they learn from, and memorize, training data becomes crucial. Memorization in LLMs is widely assumed to only occur as a result of sequences being repeated in the training data. Instead, we show that LLMs memorize by assembling information from similar sequences, a phenomena we call mosaic memory. We show major LLMs to exhibit mosaic memory, with fuzzy duplicates contributing to memorization as much as 0.8 of an exact duplicate and even heavily modified sequences contributing substantially to memorization. Despite models display reasoning capabilities, we somewhat surprisingly show memorization to be predominantly syntactic rather than semantic. We finally show fuzzy duplicates to be ubiquitous in real-world data, untouched by deduplication techniques. Taken together, our results challenge widely held beliefs and show memorization to be a more complex, mosaic process, with real-world implications for privacy, confidentiality, model utility and evaluation.

  The progress of AI is bottlenecked by the quality of evaluation, and powerful LLM-as-a-Judge models have proved to be a core solution. Improved judgment ability is enabled by stronger chain-of-thought reasoning, motivating the need to find the best recipes for training such models to think. In this work we introduce J1, a reinforcement learning approach to training such models. Our method converts both verifiable and non-verifiable prompts to judgment tasks with verifiable rewards that incentivize thinking and mitigate judgment bias. In particular, our approach outperforms all other existing 8B or 70B models when trained at those sizes, including models distilled from DeepSeek-R1. J1 also outperforms o1-mini, and even R1 on some benchmarks, despite training a smaller model. We provide analysis and ablations comparing Pairwise-J1 vs Pointwise-J1 models, offline vs online training recipes, reward strategies, seed prompts, and variations in thought length and content. We find that our models make better judgments by learning to outline evaluation criteria, comparing against self-generated reference answers, and re-evaluating the correctness of model responses.

  The advent of large language models (LLMs) has allowed numerous applications, including the generation of queried responses, to be leveraged in chatbots and other conversational assistants. Being trained on a plethora of data, LLMs often undergo high levels of over-fitting, resulting in the generation of extra and incorrect data, thus causing hallucinations in output generation. One of the root causes of such problems is the lack of timely, factual, and personalized information fed to the LLM. In this paper, we propose an approach to address these problems by introducing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist the LLM in personalized response generation tailored to the users. KGs have the advantage of storing continuously updated factual information in a structured way. While our KGs can be used for a variety of frequently updated personal data, such as calendar, contact, and location data, we focus on calendar data in this paper. Our experimental results show that our approach works significantly better in understanding personal information and generating accurate responses compared to the baseline LLMs using personal data as text inputs, with a moderate reduction in response time.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, with optimizing their input prompts playing a pivotal role in maximizing their performance. However, while LLM prompts consist of both the task-agnostic system prompts and task-specific user prompts, existing work on prompt optimization has focused on user prompts specific to individual queries or tasks, and largely overlooked the system prompt that is, once optimized, applicable across different tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we introduce the novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to design system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable to unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning framework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various user prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user prompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct experiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we show that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to diverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system prompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer optimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved performance.

  Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through reinforcement learning (RL). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's interpretability and performance. To this end, we introduce a new class of generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. RM-R1 features a chain-of-rubrics (CoR) mechanism -- self-generating sample-level chat rubrics or math/code solutions, and evaluating candidate responses against them. The training of M-R1 consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across three reward model benchmarks on average, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., INF-ORM-Llama3.1-70B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 4.9%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities on complex evaluation benchmarks, many of which are formulated as question-answering (QA) tasks. Enhancing the performance of LLMs in QA contexts is becoming increasingly vital for advancing their development and applicability. This paper introduces ARR, an intuitive, effective, and general QA solving method that explicitly incorporates three key steps: analyzing the intent of the question, retrieving relevant information, and reasoning step by step. Notably, this paper is the first to introduce intent analysis in QA, which plays a vital role in ARR. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 diverse QA tasks demonstrate that ARR consistently outperforms the baseline methods. Ablation and case studies further validate the positive contributions of each ARR component. Furthermore, experiments involving variations in prompt design indicate that ARR maintains its effectiveness regardless of the specific prompt formulation. Additionally, extensive evaluations across various model sizes, LLM series, and generation settings solidify the effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of ARR.

  We propose two simple, principled and practical algorithms that enjoy provable scaling laws for the test-time compute of large language models (LLMs). The first one is a two-stage knockout-style algorithm: given an input problem, it first generates multiple candidate solutions, and then aggregate them via a knockout tournament for the final output. Assuming that the LLM can generate a correct solution with non-zero probability and do better than a random guess in comparing a pair of correct and incorrect solutions, we prove theoretically that the failure probability of this algorithm decays to zero exponentially or by a power law (depending on the specific way of scaling) as its test-time compute grows. The second one is a two-stage league-style algorithm, where each candidate is evaluated by its average win rate against multiple opponents, rather than eliminated upon loss to a single opponent. Under analogous but more robust assumptions, we prove that its failure probability also decays to zero exponentially with more test-time compute. Both algorithms require a black-box LLM and nothing else (e.g., no verifier or reward model) for a minimalistic implementation, which makes them appealing for practical applications and easy to adapt for different tasks. Through extensive experiments with diverse models and datasets, we validate the proposed theories and demonstrate the outstanding scaling properties of both algorithms.

  The prohibitive training costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a significant bottleneck in the development of next-generation LLMs. In this paper, we show that it is possible to significantly reduce the training costs of LLMs without sacrificing their performance. Specifically, we introduce patch-level training for LLMs, in which multiple tokens are aggregated into a unit of higher information density, referred to as a `patch', to serve as the fundamental text unit for training LLMs. During patch-level training, we feed the language model shorter sequences of patches and train it to predict the next patch, thereby processing the majority of the training data at a significantly reduced cost. Following this, the model continues token-level training on the remaining training data to align with the inference mode. Experiments on a diverse range of models (370M-2.7B parameters) demonstrate that patch-level training can reduce the overall training costs to 0.5$\times$, without compromising the model performance compared to token-level training.

  In the era of increasingly sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) systems, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for diverse applications, including tasks requiring nuanced textual understanding and contextual reasoning. This study investigates the capabilities of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs - GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLAMA3, Mistral 7B, and Claude-2 - for zero-shot and few-shot annotation of a complex textual dataset comprising social media posts in Russian and Ukrainian. Specifically, the focus is on the binary classification task of identifying references to human rights violations within the dataset.To evaluate the effectiveness of these models, their annotations are compared against a gold standard set of human double-annotated labels across 1000 samples. The analysis includes assessing annotation performance under different prompting conditions, with prompts provided in both English and Russian. Additionally, the study explores the unique patterns of errors and disagreements exhibited by each model, offering insights into their strengths, limitations, and cross-linguistic adaptability.By juxtaposing LLM outputs with human annotations, this research contributes to understanding the reliability and applicability of LLMs for sensitive, domain-specific tasks in multilingual contexts. It also sheds light on how language models handle inherently subjective and context-dependent judgments, a critical consideration for their deployment in real-world scenarios.

  Long chain-of-thought (CoT) is an essential ingredient in effective usage of modern large language models, but our understanding of the reasoning strategies underlying these capabilities remains limited. While some prior works have attempted to categorize CoTs using predefined strategy types, such approaches are constrained by human intuition and fail to capture the full diversity of model behaviors. In this work, we introduce the CoT Encyclopedia, a bottom-up framework for analyzing and steering model reasoning. Our method automatically extracts diverse reasoning criteria from model-generated CoTs, embeds them into a semantic space, clusters them into representative categories, and derives contrastive rubrics to interpret reasoning behavior. Human evaluations show that this framework produces more interpretable and comprehensive analyses than existing methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that this understanding enables performance gains: we can predict which strategy a model is likely to use and guide it toward more effective alternatives. Finally, we provide practical insights, such as that training data format (e.g., free-form vs. multiple-choice) has a far greater impact on reasoning behavior than data domain, underscoring the importance of format-aware model design.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across natural language tasks, but their ability to forecast violent conflict remains underexplored. We investigate whether LLMs possess meaningful parametric knowledge-encoded in their pretrained weights-to predict conflict escalation and fatalities without external data. This is critical for early warning systems, humanitarian planning, and policy-making. We compare this parametric knowledge with non-parametric capabilities, where LLMs access structured and unstructured context from conflict datasets (e.g., ACLED, GDELT) and recent news reports via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Incorporating external information could enhance model performance by providing up-to-date context otherwise missing from pretrained weights. Our two-part evaluation framework spans 2020-2024 across conflict-prone regions in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. In the parametric setting, LLMs predict conflict trends and fatalities relying only on pretrained knowledge. In the non-parametric setting, models receive summaries of recent conflict events, indicators, and geopolitical developments. We compare predicted conflict trend labels (e.g., Escalate, Stable Conflict, De-escalate, Peace) and fatalities against historical data. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs for conflict forecasting and the benefits of augmenting them with structured external knowledge.

  _Timour Ichmoukhamedov, David Martens_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Several recent works argue that LLMs have a universal truth direction where true and false statements are linearly separable in the activation space of the model. It has been demonstrated that linear probes trained on a single hidden state of the model already generalize across a range of topics and might even be used for lie detection in LLM conversations. In this work we explore how this truth direction generalizes between various conversational formats. We find good generalization between short conversations that end on a lie, but poor generalization to longer formats where the lie appears earlier in the input prompt. We propose a solution that significantly improves this type of generalization by adding a fixed key phrase at the end of each conversation. Our results highlight the challenges towards reliable LLM lie detectors that generalize to new settings.

  Pretrained language models (LLMs) are often constrained by their fixed tokenization schemes, leading to inefficiencies and performance limitations, particularly for multilingual or specialized applications. This tokenizer lock-in presents significant challenges. standard methods to overcome this often require prohibitive computational resources. Although tokenizer replacement with heuristic initialization aims to reduce this burden, existing methods often require exhaustive residual fine-tuning and still may not fully preserve semantic nuances or adequately address the underlying compression inefficiencies. Our framework introduces two innovations: first, Tokenadapt, a model-agnostic tokenizer transplantation method, and second, novel pre-tokenization learning for multi-word Supertokens to enhance compression and reduce fragmentation. Tokenadapt initializes new unique token embeddings via a hybrid heuristic that combines two methods: a local estimate based on subword decomposition using the old tokenizer, and a global estimate utilizing the top-k semantically similar tokens from the original vocabulary. This methodology aims to preserve semantics while significantly minimizing retraining requirements. Empirical investigations validate both contributions: the transplantation heuristic successfully initializes unique tokens, markedly outperforming conventional baselines and sophisticated methods including Transtokenizer and ReTok, while our Supertokens achieve notable compression gains. Our zero-shot perplexity results demonstrate that the TokenAdapt hybrid initialization consistently yields lower perplexity ratios compared to both ReTok and TransTokenizer baselines across different base models and newly trained target tokenizers. TokenAdapt typically reduced the overall perplexity ratio significantly compared to ReTok, yielding at least a 2-fold improvement in these aggregate scores.

  Subjective Answer Grading (SAG) plays a crucial role in education, standardized testing, and automated assessment systems, particularly for evaluating short-form responses in Short Answer Scoring (SAS). However, existing approaches often produce coarse-grained scores and lack detailed reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as zero-shot evaluators, they remain susceptible to bias, inconsistencies with human judgment, and limited transparency in scoring decisions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SAS-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based SAS tasks. SAS-Bench provides fine-grained, step-wise scoring, expert-annotated error categories, and a diverse range of question types derived from real-world subject-specific exams. This benchmark facilitates detailed evaluation of model reasoning processes and explainability. We also release an open-source dataset containing 1,030 questions and 4,109 student responses, each annotated by domain experts. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments with various LLMs, identifying major challenges in scoring science-related questions and highlighting the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in improving scoring accuracy. Our work offers valuable insights into the development of more robust, fair, and educationally meaningful LLM-based evaluation systems.

  Navigating high-stakes dilemmas involving conflicting values is challenging even for humans, let alone for AI. Yet prior work in evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in such situations has been limited to everyday scenarios. To close this gap, this work first introduces CLASH (Character perspective-based LLM Assessments in Situations with High-stakes), a meticulously curated dataset consisting of 345 high-impact dilemmas along with 3,795 individual perspectives of diverse values. In particular, we design CLASH in a way to support the study of critical aspects of value-based decision-making processes which are missing from prior work, including understanding decision ambivalence and psychological discomfort as well as capturing the temporal shifts of values in characters' perspectives. By benchmarking 10 open and closed frontier models, we uncover several key findings. (1) Even the strongest models, such as GPT-4o and Claude-Sonnet, achieve less than 50% accuracy in identifying situations where the decision should be ambivalent, while they perform significantly better in clear-cut scenarios. (2) While LLMs reasonably predict psychological discomfort as marked by human, they inadequately comprehend perspectives involving value shifts, indicating a need for LLMs to reason over complex values. (3) Our experiments also reveal a significant correlation between LLMs' value preferences and their steerability towards a given value. (4) Finally, LLMs exhibit greater steerability when engaged in value reasoning from a third-party perspective, compared to a first-person setup, though certain value pairs benefit uniquely from the first-person framing.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are widely used to assess medical students' communication skills, but scoring interview-based assessments is time-consuming and potentially subject to human bias. This study explored the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate OSCE evaluations using the Master Interview Rating Scale (MIRS). We compared the performance of four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Llama 3.1, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) in evaluating OSCE transcripts across all 28 items of the MIRS under the conditions of zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), few-shot, and multi-step prompting. The models were benchmarked against a dataset of 10 OSCE cases with 174 expert consensus scores available. Model performance was measured using three accuracy metrics (exact, off-by-one, thresholded). Averaging across all MIRS items and OSCE cases, LLMs performed with low exact accuracy (0.27 to 0.44), and moderate to high off-by-one accuracy (0.67 to 0.87) and thresholded accuracy (0.75 to 0.88). A zero temperature parameter ensured high intra-rater reliability ({\alpha} = 0.98 for GPT-4o). CoT, few-shot, and multi-step techniques proved valuable when tailored to specific assessment items. The performance was consistent across MIRS items, independent of encounter phases and communication domains. We demonstrated the feasibility of AI-assisted OSCE evaluation and provided benchmarking of multiple LLMs across multiple prompt techniques. Our work provides a baseline performance assessment for LLMs that lays a foundation for future research into automated assessment of clinical communication skills.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains essential for knowledge-based question answering (KBQA), current paradigms face critical challenges under specific domains. Existing methods struggle with targeted adaptation on small-scale KBs: vanilla unsupervised training exhibits poor effectiveness, while fine-tuning incurs prohibitive costs of external signals. We present KBAlign, a self-supervised framework that enhances RAG systems through efficient model adaptation. Our key insight is to leverage the model's intrinsic capabilities for knowledge alignment through two innovative mechanisms: multi-grained self-annotation that captures global knowledge for data construction, and iterative tuning that accelerates convergence through self verification. This framework enables cost-effective model adaptation to specific textual KBs, without human supervision or external model assistance. Experiments demonstrate that KBAlign can achieve 90\% of the performance gain obtained through GPT-4-supervised adaptation, while relying entirely on self-annotation of much smaller models. KBAlign significantly improves downstream QA accuracy across multiple domains with tiny costs, particularly benefiting scenarios requiring deep knowledge integration from specialized corpora. We release our experimental data, models, and process analyses to the community for further exploration (this https URL).

  In this paper, we introduce FAMMA, an open-source benchmark for \underline{f}in\underline{a}ncial \underline{m}ultilingual \underline{m}ultimodal question \underline{a}nswering (QA). Our benchmark aims to evaluate the abilities of large language models (LLMs) in answering complex reasoning questions that require advanced financial knowledge. The benchmark has two versions: FAMMA-Basic consists of 1,945 questions extracted from university textbooks and exams, along with human-annotated answers and rationales; FAMMA-LivePro consists of 103 novel questions created by human domain experts, with answers and rationales held out from the public for a contamination-free evaluation. These questions cover advanced knowledge of 8 major subfields in finance (e.g., corporate finance, derivatives, and portfolio management). Some are in Chinese or French, while a majority of them are in English. Each question has some non-text data such as charts, diagrams, or tables. Our experiments reveal that FAMMA poses a significant challenge on LLMs, including reasoning models such as GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Additionally, we curated 1,270 reasoning trajectories of DeepSeek-R1 on the FAMMA-Basic data, and fine-tuned a series of open-source Qwen models using this reasoning data. We found that training a model on these reasoning trajectories can significantly improve its performance on FAMMA-LivePro. We released our leaderboard, data, code, and trained models atthis https URL.

  Who is the US President? The answer changes depending on when the question is asked. While large language models (LLMs) are evaluated on various reasoning tasks, they often miss a crucial dimension: time. In real-world scenarios, the correctness of answers is frequently tied to temporal context. To address this gap, we present a novel framework and dataset spanning over 8,000 events from 2018 to 2024, annotated with day-level granularity and sourced globally across domains such as politics, science, and business. Our TimeShift evaluation method systematically probes LLMs for temporal reasoning, revealing that base models often outperform instruction-tuned and synthetic-trained counterparts on time-sensitive recall. Additionally, we find that even large-scale models exhibit brittleness in handling paraphrased facts, highlighting unresolved challenges in temporal consistency. By identifying these limitations, our work provides a significant step toward advancing time-aware language models capable of adapting to the dynamic nature of real-world knowledge.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The quantization of large language models (LLMs) has been a prominent research area aimed at enabling their lightweight deployment in practice. Existing research about LLM's quantization has mainly explored the interplay between weights and activations, or employing auxiliary components while neglecting the necessity of adjusting weights during quantization. Consequently, original weight distributions frequently fail to yield desired results after round-to-nearest (RTN) quantization. Even though incorporating techniques such as mixed precision and low-rank error approximation in LLM's quantization can yield improved results, they inevitably introduce additional computational overhead. On the other hand, traditional techniques for weight quantization, such as Generative Post-Training Quantization, rely on manually tweaking weight distributions to minimize local errors, but they fall short of achieving globally optimal outcomes. Although the recently proposed Learnable Singular-value Increment improves global weight quantization by modifying weight distributions, it disrupts the original distribution considerably. This introduces pronounced bias toward the training data and can degrade downstream task performance. In this paper, we introduce Singular-value Diagonal Expansion, a more nuanced approach to refining weight distributions to achieve better quantization alignment. Furthermore, we introduce Cross-layer Learning that improves overall quantization outcomes by distributing errors more evenly across layers. Our plug-and-play weight-quantization methods demonstrate substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, including OmniQuant, DuQuant, and PrefixQuant.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this study, we investigate whether attention-based information flow inside large language models (LLMs) is aggregated through noticeable patterns for long context processing. Our observations reveal that LLMs aggregate information through Pyramidal Information Funneling where attention is scattering widely in lower layers, progressively consolidating within specific contexts, and ultimately focusing on critical tokens (a.k.a massive activation or attention sink) in higher layers. Motivated by these insights, we developed PyramidKV, a novel and effective KV cache compression method. This approach dynamically adjusts the KV cache size across different layers, allocating more cache in lower layers and less in higher ones, diverging from traditional methods that maintain a uniform KV cache size. Our experimental evaluations, utilizing the LongBench benchmark, show that PyramidKV matches the performance of models with a full KV cache while retaining only 12% of the KV cache, thus significantly reducing memory usage. In scenarios emphasizing memory efficiency, where only 0.7% of the KV cache is maintained, PyramidKV surpasses other KV cache compression techniques, achieving up to a 20.5 absolute accuracy improvement on TREC dataset. In the Needle-in-a-Haystack experiment, PyramidKV outperforms competing methods in maintaining long-context comprehension in LLMs; notably, retaining just 128 KV cache entries enables the LLAMA-3-70B model to achieve 100.0 Acc. performance.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. Nonetheless, it was also witnessed that LLMs tend to produce inaccurate responses to specific queries. This deficiency can be traced to the tokenization step LLMs must undergo, which is an inevitable limitation inherent to all LLMs. In fact, incorrect tokenization is the critical point that hinders LLMs in understanding the input precisely, thus leading to unsatisfactory output. This defect is more obvious in Chinese scenarios. To demonstrate this flaw of LLMs, we construct an adversarial dataset, named as $\textbf{ADT (Adversarial Dataset for Tokenizer)}$, which draws upon the vocabularies of various open-source LLMs to challenge LLMs' tokenization. ADT consists of two subsets: the manually constructed ADT-Human and the automatically generated ADT-Auto. Our empirical results reveal that our ADT is highly effective on challenging the tokenization of leading LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama-3, Deepseek-R1 and so on, thus degrading these LLMs' capabilities. Moreover, our method of automatic data generation has been proven efficient and robust, which can be applied to any open-source LLMs. In this paper, we substantially investigate LLMs' vulnerability in terms of challenging their token segmentation, which will shed light on the subsequent research of improving LLMs' capabilities through optimizing their tokenization process and algorithms.

  Knowledge in materials science is widely dispersed across extensive scientific literature, posing significant challenges to the efficient discovery and integration of new materials. Traditional methods, often reliant on costly and time-consuming experimental approaches, further complicate rapid innovation. Addressing these challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence with materials science has opened avenues for accelerating the discovery process, though it also demands precise annotation, data extraction, and traceability of information. To tackle these issues, this article introduces the Materials Knowledge Graph (MKG), which utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques integrated with large language models to extract and systematically organize a decade's worth of high-quality research into structured triples, contains 162,605 nodes and 731,772 edges. MKG categorizes information into comprehensive labels such as Name, Formula, and Application, structured around a meticulously designed ontology, thus enhancing data usability and integration. By implementing network-based algorithms, MKG not only facilitates efficient link prediction but also significantly reduces reliance on traditional experimental methods. This structured approach not only streamlines materials research but also lays the groundwork for more sophisticated science knowledge graphs.

  Code security and usability are both essential for various coding assistant applications driven by large language models (LLMs). Current code security benchmarks focus solely on single evaluation task and paradigm, such as code completion and generation, lacking comprehensive assessment across dimensions like secure code generation, vulnerability repair and discrimination. In this paper, we first propose CoV-Eval, a multi-task benchmark covering various tasks such as code completion, vulnerability repair, vulnerability detection and classification, for comprehensive evaluation of LLM code security. Besides, we developed VC-Judge, an improved judgment model that aligns closely with human experts and can review LLM-generated programs for vulnerabilities in a more efficient and reliable way. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 proprietary and open-source LLMs. Overall, while most LLMs identify vulnerable codes well, they still tend to generate insecure codes and struggle with recognizing specific vulnerability types and performing repairs. Extensive experiments and qualitative analyses reveal key challenges and optimization directions, offering insights for future research in LLM code security.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an effective method to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing methods focus on optimizing the retriever or generator in the RAG system by directly utilizing the top-k retrieved documents. However, the documents effectiveness are various significantly across user queries, i.e. some documents provide valuable knowledge while others totally lack critical information. It hinders the retriever and generator's adaptation during training. Inspired by human cognitive learning, curriculum learning trains models using samples progressing from easy to difficult, thus enhancing their generalization ability, and we integrate this effective paradigm to the training of the RAG system. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage Curriculum Learning based RAG system training framework, named CL-RAG. We first construct training data with multiple difficulty levels for the retriever and generator separately through sample evolution. Then, we train the model in stages based on the curriculum learning approach, thereby optimizing the overall performance and generalization of the RAG system more effectively. Our CL-RAG framework demonstrates consistent effectiveness across four open-domain QA datasets, achieving performance gains of 2% to 4% over multiple advanced methods.

  Plain language summaries (PLSs) are essential for facilitating effective communication between clinicians and patients by making complex medical information easier for laypeople to understand and act upon. Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in automating PLS generation, but their effectiveness in supporting health information comprehension remains unclear. Prior evaluations have generally relied on automated scores that do not measure understandability directly, or subjective Likert-scale ratings from convenience samples with limited generalizability. To address these gaps, we conducted a large-scale crowdsourced evaluation of LLM-generated PLSs using Amazon Mechanical Turk with 150 participants. We assessed PLS quality through subjective Likert-scale ratings focusing on simplicity, informativeness, coherence, and faithfulness; and objective multiple-choice comprehension and recall measures of reader understanding. Additionally, we examined the alignment between 10 automated evaluation metrics and human judgments. Our findings indicate that while LLMs can generate PLSs that appear indistinguishable from human-written ones in subjective evaluations, human-written PLSs lead to significantly better comprehension. Furthermore, automated evaluation metrics fail to reflect human judgment, calling into question their suitability for evaluating PLSs. This is the first study to systematically evaluate LLM-generated PLSs based on both reader preferences and comprehension outcomes. Our findings highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that move beyond surface-level quality and for generation methods that explicitly optimize for layperson comprehension.

  _Benjamin White, Anastasia Shimorina_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper explores the design of an aspect-based sentiment analysis system using large language models (LLMs) for real-world use. We focus on quadruple opinion extraction -- identifying aspect categories, sentiment polarity, targets, and opinion expressions from text data across different domains and languages. Using internal datasets, we investigate whether a single fine-tuned model can effectively handle multiple domain-specific taxonomies simultaneously. We demonstrate that a combined multi-domain model achieves performance comparable to specialized single-domain models while reducing operational complexity. We also share lessons learned for handling non-extractive predictions and evaluating various failure modes when developing LLM-based systems for structured prediction tasks.

  Semantic text representation is a fundamental task in the field of natural language processing. Existing text embedding (e.g., SimCSE and LLM2Vec) have demonstrated excellent performance, but the values of each dimension are difficult to trace and interpret. Bag-of-words, as classic sparse interpretable embeddings, suffers from poor performance. Recently, Benara et al. (2024) propose interpretable text embeddings using large language models, which forms "0/1" embeddings based on responses to a series of questions. These interpretable text embeddings are typically high-dimensional (larger than 10,000). In this work, we propose Low-dimensional (lower than 500) Dense and Interpretable text embeddings with Relative representations (LDIR). The numerical values of its dimensions indicate semantic relatedness to different anchor texts through farthest point sampling, offering both semantic representation as well as a certain level of traceability and interpretability. We validate LDIR on multiple semantic textual similarity, retrieval, and clustering tasks. Extensive experimental results show that LDIR performs close to the black-box baseline models and outperforms the interpretable embeddings baselines with much fewer dimensions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Clinical evidence, derived from rigorous research and data analysis, provides healthcare professionals with reliable scientific foundations for informed decision-making. Integrating clinical evidence into real-time practice is challenging due to the enormous workload, complex professional processes, and time constraints. This highlights the need for tools that automate evidence synthesis to support more efficient and accurate decision making in clinical settings. This study introduces Quicker, an evidence-based clinical decision support system powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to automate evidence synthesis and generate clinical recommendations modeled after standard clinical guideline development processes. Quicker implements a fully automated chain that covers all phases, from questions to clinical recommendations, and further enables customized decision-making through integrated tools and interactive user interfaces. To evaluate Quicker's capabilities, we developed the Q2CRBench-3 benchmark dataset, based on clinical guideline development records for three different diseases. Experimental results highlighted Quicker's strong performance, with fine-grained question decomposition tailored to user preferences, retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and literature screening performance approaching comprehensive inclusion of relevant studies. In addition, Quicker-assisted evidence assessment effectively supported human reviewers, while Quicker's recommendations were more comprehensive and logically coherent than those of clinicians. In system-level testing, collaboration between a single reviewer and Quicker reduced the time required for recommendation development to 20-40 minutes. In general, our findings affirm the potential of Quicker to help physicians make quicker and more reliable evidence-based clinical decisions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Role-playing conversational agents (RPCAs) face persistent challenges in maintaining role consistency. To address this, we propose RAIDEN-R1, a novel reinforcement learning framework that integrates Verifiable Role-Awareness Reward (VRAR). The method introduces both singular and multi-term mining strategies to generate quantifiable rewards by assessing role-specific keys. Additionally, we construct a high-quality, role-aware Chain-of-Thought dataset through multi-LLM collaboration, and implement experiments to enhance reasoning coherence. Experiments on the RAIDEN benchmark demonstrate RAIDEN-R1's superiority: our 14B-GRPO model achieves 88.04% and 88.65% accuracy on Script-Based Knowledge and Conversation Memory metrics, respectively, outperforming baseline models while maintaining robustness. Case analyses further reveal the model's enhanced ability to resolve conflicting contextual cues and sustain first-person narrative consistency. This work bridges the non-quantifiability gap in RPCA training and provides insights into role-aware reasoning patterns, advancing the development of RPCAs.

  _Jintian Shao, Hongyi Huang, Jiayi Wu, YiMing Cheng, ZhiYu Wu, You Shan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success but face significant computational and memory challenges, particularly due to their extensive output vocabularies. The final linear projection layer, mapping hidden states to vocabulary-sized logits, often constitutes a substantial portion of the model's parameters and computational cost during inference. Existing methods like adaptive softmax or hierarchical softmax introduce structural complexities. In this paper, we propose VQ-Logits, a novel approach that leverages Vector Quantization (VQ) to drastically reduce the parameter count and computational load of the LLM output layer. VQ-Logits replaces the large V * dmodel output embedding matrix with a small, shared codebook of K embedding vectors (K << V ). Each token in the vocabulary is mapped to one of these K codebook vectors. The LLM predicts logits over this compact codebook, which are then efficiently "scattered" to the full vocabulary space using the learned or preassigned mapping. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on standard language modeling benchmarks (e.g., WikiText-103, C4) that VQ-Logits can achieve up to 99% parameter reduction in the output layer and 6x speedup in logit computation, with only a marginal 4% increase in perplexity compared to full softmax baselines. We further provide detailed ablation studies on codebook size, initialization, and learning strategies, showcasing the robustness and effectiveness of our approach.

  _Longchao Da, Parth Mitesh Shah, Kuan-Ru Liou, Jiaxing Zhang, Hua Wei_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models are now key assistants in human decision-making processes. However, a common note always seems to follow: "LLMs can make mistakes. Be careful with important info." This points to the reality that not all outputs from LLMs are dependable, and users must evaluate them manually. The challenge deepens as hallucinated responses, often presented with seemingly plausible explanations, create complications and raise trust issues among users. To tackle such issue, this paper proposes GE-Chat, a knowledge Graph enhanced retrieval-augmented generation framework to provide Evidence-based response generation. Specifically, when the user uploads a material document, a knowledge graph will be created, which helps construct a retrieval-augmented agent, enhancing the agent's responses with additional knowledge beyond its training corpus. Then we leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic generation, n-hop sub-graph searching, and entailment-based sentence generation to realize accurate evidence retrieval. We demonstrate that our method improves the existing models' performance in terms of identifying the exact evidence in a free-form context, providing a reliable way to examine the resources of LLM's conclusion and help with the judgment of the trustworthiness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce S-MedQA, an English medical question-answering (QA) dataset for benchmarking large language models in fine-grained clinical specialties. We use S-MedQA to check the applicability of a popular hypothesis related to knowledge injection in the knowledge-intense scenario of medical QA, and show that: 1) training on data from a speciality does not necessarily lead to best performance on that specialty and 2) regardless of the specialty fine-tuned on, token probabilities of clinically relevant terms for all specialties increase consistently. Thus, we believe improvement gains come mostly from domain shifting (e.g., general to medical) rather than knowledge injection and suggest rethinking the role of fine-tuning data in the medical domain. We release S-MedQA and all code needed to reproduce all our experiments to the research community.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose XRAG, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the generation abilities of LLMs in cross-lingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) settings where the user language does not match the retrieval results. XRAG is constructed from recent news articles to ensure that its questions require external knowledge to be answered. It covers the real-world scenarios of monolingual and multilingual retrieval, and provides relevancy annotations for each retrieved document. Our novel dataset construction pipeline results in questions that require complex reasoning, as evidenced by the significant gap between human and LLM performance. Consequently, XRAG serves as a valuable benchmark for studying LLM reasoning abilities, even before considering the additional cross-lingual complexity. Experimental results on five LLMs uncover two previously unreported challenges in cross-lingual RAG: 1) in the monolingual retrieval setting, all evaluated models struggle with response language correctness; 2) in the multilingual retrieval setting, the main challenge lies in reasoning over retrieved information across languages rather than generation of non-English text.

  _Han Peng, Jinhao Jiang, Zican Dong, Wayne Xin Zhao, Lei Fang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their input context length, yet they still struggle with retrieval and reasoning in long-context inputs. Existing methods propose to utilize the prompt strategy and retrieval head to alleviate this limitation. However, they still face challenges in balancing retrieval precision and recall, impacting their efficacy in answering questions. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{CAFE}$, a two-stage coarse-to-fine method to enhance multi-document question-answering capacities. By gradually eliminating the negative impacts of background and distracting documents, CAFE makes the responses more reliant on the evidence documents. Initially, a coarse-grained filtering method leverages retrieval heads to identify and rank relevant documents. Then, a fine-grained steering method guides attention to the most relevant content. Experiments across benchmarks show CAFE outperforms baselines, achieving up to 22.1% and 13.7% SubEM improvement over SFT and RAG methods on the Mistral model, respectively.

  _Lake Yin, Fan Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) have risen in prominence over the past few years, there has been concern over the potential biases in LLMs inherited from the training data. Previous studies have examined how LLMs exhibit implicit bias, such as when response generation changes when different social contexts are introduced. We argue that this implicit bias is not only an ethical, but also a technical issue, as it reveals an inability of LLMs to accommodate extraneous information. However, unlike other measures of LLM intelligence, there are no standard methods to benchmark this specific subset of LLM bias. To bridge this gap, we developed a method for calculating an easily interpretable benchmark, DIF (Demographic Implicit Fairness), by evaluating preexisting LLM logic and math problem datasets with sociodemographic personas. We demonstrate that this method can statistically validate the presence of implicit bias in LLM behavior and find an inverse trend between question answering accuracy and implicit bias, supporting our argument.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt optimization (PO) offers a practical alternative to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), enabling performance improvements without altering model weights. Existing methods typically rely on advanced, large-scale LLMs like GPT-4 to generate optimized prompts. However, due to limited downward compatibility, verbose, instruction-heavy prompts from advanced LLMs can overwhelm lightweight inference models and degrade response quality. In this work, we rethink prompt optimization through the lens of interpretable design. We first identify a set of model-agnostic prompt quality merits and empirically validate their effectiveness in enhancing prompt and response quality. We then introduce MePO, a merit-guided, lightweight, and locally deployable prompt optimizer trained on our preference dataset built from merit-aligned prompts generated by a lightweight LLM. Unlike prior work, MePO avoids online optimization reliance, reduces cost and privacy concerns, and, by learning clear, interpretable merits, generalizes effectively to both large-scale and lightweight inference models. Experiments demonstrate that MePO achieves better results across diverse tasks and model types, offering a scalable and robust solution for real-world deployment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models are, by definition, based on language. In an effort to underscore the critical need for regional localized models, this paper examines primary differences between variants of written Spanish across Latin America and Spain, with an in-depth sociocultural and linguistic contextualization therein. We argue that these differences effectively constitute significant gaps in the quotidian use of Spanish among dialectal groups by creating sociolinguistic dissonances, to the extent that locale-sensitive AI models would play a pivotal role in bridging these divides. In doing so, this approach informs better and more efficient localization strategies that also serve to more adequately meet inclusivity goals, while securing sustainable active daily user growth in a major low-risk investment geographic area. Therefore, implementing at least the proposed five sub variants of Spanish addresses two lines of action: to foment user trust and reliance on AI language models while also demonstrating a level of cultural, historical, and sociolinguistic awareness that reflects positively on any internationalization strategy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Each year, tens of millions of essays are written and graded in college-level English courses. Students are asked to analyze literary and cultural texts through a process known as close reading, in which they gather textual details to formulate evidence-based arguments. Despite being viewed as a basis for critical thinking and widely adopted as a required element of university coursework, close reading has never been evaluated on large language models (LLMs), and multi-discipline benchmarks like MMLU do not include literature as a subject. To fill this gap, we present KRISTEVA, the first close reading benchmark for evaluating interpretive reasoning, consisting of 1331 multiple-choice questions adapted from classroom data. With KRISTEVA, we propose three progressively more difficult sets of tasks to approximate different elements of the close reading process, which we use to test how well LLMs may seem to understand and reason about literary works: 1) extracting stylistic features, 2) retrieving relevant contextual information from parametric knowledge, and 3) multi-hop reasoning between style and external contexts. Our baseline results find that, while state-of-the-art LLMs possess some college-level close reading competency (accuracy 49.7% - 69.7%), their performances still trail those of experienced human evaluators on 10 out of our 11 tasks.

  _Xin Liu, Lechen Zhang, Sheza Munir, Yiyang Gu, Lu Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating long-form responses, but evaluating their factuality remains challenging due to complex inter-sentence dependencies within the generated facts. Prior solutions predominantly follow a decompose-decontextualize-verify pipeline but often fail to capture essential context and miss key relational facts. In this paper, we introduce VeriFact, a factuality evaluation framework designed to enhance fact extraction by identifying and resolving incomplete and missing facts to support more accurate verification results. Moreover, we introduce FactRBench , a benchmark that evaluates both precision and recall in long-form model responses, whereas prior work primarily focuses on precision. FactRBench provides reference fact sets from advanced LLMs and human-written answers, enabling recall assessment. Empirical evaluations show that VeriFact significantly enhances fact completeness and preserves complex facts with critical relational information, resulting in more accurate factuality evaluation. Benchmarking various open- and close-weight LLMs on FactRBench indicate that larger models within same model family improve precision and recall, but high precision does not always correlate with high recall, underscoring the importance of comprehensive factuality assessment.

  We directly compare the persuasion capabilities of a frontier large language model (LLM; Claude Sonnet 3.5) against incentivized human persuaders in an interactive, real-time conversational quiz setting. In this preregistered, large-scale incentivized experiment, participants (quiz takers) completed an online quiz where persuaders (either humans or LLMs) attempted to persuade quiz takers toward correct or incorrect answers. We find that LLM persuaders achieved significantly higher compliance with their directional persuasion attempts than incentivized human persuaders, demonstrating superior persuasive capabilities in both truthful (toward correct answers) and deceptive (toward incorrect answers) contexts. We also find that LLM persuaders significantly increased quiz takers' accuracy, leading to higher earnings, when steering quiz takers toward correct answers, and significantly decreased their accuracy, leading to lower earnings, when steering them toward incorrect answers. Overall, our findings suggest that AI's persuasion capabilities already exceed those of humans that have real-money bonuses tied to performance. Our findings of increasingly capable AI persuaders thus underscore the urgency of emerging alignment and governance frameworks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in reinforcement learning for language model post-training, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have shown promise in low-resource settings. However, GRPO typically relies on solution-level and scalar reward signals that fail to capture the semantic diversity among sampled completions. This leads to what we identify as a diversity-quality inconsistency, where distinct reasoning paths may receive indistinguishable rewards. To address this limitation, we propose $\textit{Diversity-aware Reward Adjustment}$ (DRA), a method that explicitly incorporates semantic diversity into the reward computation. DRA uses Submodular Mutual Information (SMI) to downweight redundant completions and amplify rewards for diverse ones. This encourages better exploration during learning, while maintaining stable exploitation of high-quality samples. Our method integrates seamlessly with both GRPO and its variant DR.~GRPO, resulting in $\textit{DRA-GRPO}$ and $\textit{DGA-DR.~GRPO}$. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks and find that it outperforms recent strong baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 58.2%, using only 7,000 fine-tuning samples and a total training cost of approximately $55.

We explain how this novel compression technique can be lossless and how the detail granularity is controllable.

  The recent development of reasoning language models (RLMs) represents a novel evolution in large language models. In particular, the recent release of DeepSeek-R1 has generated widespread social impact and sparked enthusiasm in the research community for exploring the explicit reasoning paradigm of language models. However, the implementation details of the released models have not been fully open-sourced by DeepSeek, including DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and the distilled small models. As a result, many replication studies have emerged aiming to reproduce the strong performance achieved by DeepSeek-R1, reaching comparable performance through similar training procedures and fully open-source data resources. These works have investigated feasible strategies for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), focusing on data preparation and method design, yielding various valuable insights. In this report, we provide a summary of recent replication studies to inspire future research. We primarily focus on SFT and RLVR as two main directions, introducing the details for data construction, method design and training procedure of current replication studies. Moreover, we conclude key findings from the implementation details and experimental results reported by these studies, anticipating to inspire future research. We also discuss additional techniques of enhancing RLMs, highlighting the potential of expanding the application scope of these models, and discussing the challenges in development. By this survey, we aim to help researchers and developers of RLMs stay updated with the latest advancements, and seek to inspire new ideas to further enhance RLMs.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable across academia, industry, and daily applications, yet current evaluation methods struggle to keep pace with their rapid development. One core challenge of evaluation in the large language model (LLM) era is the generalization issue: how to infer a model's near-unbounded abilities from inevitably bounded benchmarks. We address this challenge by proposing Model Utilization Index (MUI), a mechanism interpretability enhanced metric that complements traditional performance scores. MUI quantifies the effort a model expends on a task, defined as the proportion of activated neurons or features during inference. Intuitively, a truly capable model should achieve higher performance with lower effort. Extensive experiments across popular LLMs reveal a consistent inverse logarithmic relationship between MUI and performance, which we formulate as the Utility Law. From this law we derive four practical corollaries that (i) guide training diagnostics, (ii) expose data contamination issue, (iii) enable fairer model comparisons, and (iv) design model-specific dataset diversity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite significant advancements in large language models (LLMs), a major drawback of reasoning models is their enormous token usage, which increases computational cost, resource requirements, and response time. In this work, we revisit the core principles of reinforcement learning (RL) and, through mathematical analysis, demonstrate that the tendency to generate lengthy responses arises inherently from RL-based optimization during training. This finding questions the prevailing assumption that longer responses inherently improve reasoning accuracy. Instead, we uncover a natural correlation between conciseness and accuracy that has been largely overlooked. We show that introducing a secondary phase of RL training, using a very small set of problems, can significantly reduce chains of thought while maintaining or even enhancing accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that, while GRPO shares some interesting properties of PPO, it suffers from collapse modes, which limit its reliability for concise reasoning. Finally, we validate our conclusions through extensive experimental results.

  Video-based dialogue systems, such as education assistants, have compelling application value, thereby garnering growing interest. However, the current video-based dialogue systems are limited by their reliance on a single dialogue type, which hinders their versatility in practical applications across a range of scenarios, including question-answering, emotional dialog, etc. In this paper, we identify this challenge as how to generate video-driven multilingual mixed-type dialogues. To mitigate this challenge, we propose a novel task and create a human-to-human video-driven multilingual mixed-type dialogue corpus, termed KwaiChat, containing a total of 93,209 videos and 246,080 dialogues, across 4 dialogue types, 30 domains, 4 languages, and 13 topics. Additionally, we establish baseline models on KwaiChat. An extensive analysis of 7 distinct LLMs on KwaiChat reveals that GPT-4o achieves the best performance but still cannot perform well in this situation even with the help of in-context learning and fine-tuning, which indicates that the task is not trivial and needs further research.

  LLM Ensemble -- which involves the comprehensive use of multiple large language models (LLMs), each aimed at handling user queries during downstream inference, to benefit from their individual strengths -- has gained substantial attention recently. The widespread availability of LLMs, coupled with their varying strengths and out-of-the-box usability, has profoundly advanced the field of LLM Ensemble. This paper presents the first systematic review of recent developments in LLM Ensemble. First, we introduce our taxonomy of LLM Ensemble and discuss several related research problems. Then, we provide a more in-depth classification of the methods under the broad categories of "ensemble-before-inference, ensemble-during-inference, ensemble-after-inference'', and review all relevant methods. Finally, we introduce related benchmarks and applications, summarize existing studies, and suggest several future research directions.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in handling complex tasks requiring both extensive knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, the existing LLM inference pipeline operates as an opaque process without explicit separation between knowledge retrieval and reasoning steps, making the model's decision-making process unclear and disorganized. This ambiguity can lead to issues such as hallucinations and knowledge forgetting, which significantly impact the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we propose a new inference paradigm that decomposes the complex inference process into two distinct and clear actions: (1) memory recall: which retrieves relevant knowledge, and (2) reasoning: which performs logical steps based on the recalled knowledge. To facilitate this decomposition, we introduce two special tokens memory and reason, guiding the model to distinguish between steps that require knowledge retrieval and those that involve reasoning. Our experiment results show that this decomposition not only improves model performance but also enhances the interpretability of the inference process, enabling users to identify sources of error and refine model responses effectively.

  Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) usually take input as a concatenation of image token embeddings and text token embeddings and conduct causal modeling. However, their internal behaviors remain underexplored, raising the question of interaction among two types of tokens. To investigate such multimodal interaction during model inference, in this paper, we measure the contextualization among the hidden state vectors of tokens from different modalities. Our experiments uncover a four-phase inference dynamics of VLLMs against the depth of Transformer-based LMs, including (I) Alignment: In very early layers, contextualization emerges between modalities, suggesting a feature space alignment. (II) Intra-modal Encoding: In early layers, intra-modal contextualization is enhanced while inter-modal interaction is suppressed, suggesting a local encoding within modalities. (III) Inter-modal Encoding: In later layers, contextualization across modalities is enhanced, suggesting a deeper fusion across modalities. (IV) Output Preparation: In very late layers, contextualization is reduced globally, and hidden states are aligned towards the unembedding space.

  Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in a wide range of tasks, leading to increasing attention towards the research on how scaling LLMs affects their performance. Existing works, termed Scaling Laws, have discovered that the final test loss of LLMs scales as power-laws with model size, computational budget, and dataset size. However, the temporal change of the test loss of an LLM throughout its pre-training process remains unexplored, though it is valuable in many aspects, such as selecting better hyperparameters \textit{directly} on the target LLM. In this paper, we propose the novel concept of Temporal Scaling Law, studying how the test loss of an LLM evolves as the training steps scale up. In contrast to modeling the test loss as a whole in a coarse-grained manner, we break it down and dive into the fine-grained test loss of each token position, and further develop a dynamic hyperbolic-law. Afterwards, we derive the much more precise temporal scaling law by studying the temporal patterns of the parameters in the dynamic hyperbolic-law. Results on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) validation datasets demonstrate that our temporal scaling law accurately predicts the test loss of LLMs across training steps. Our temporal scaling law has broad practical applications. First, it enables direct and efficient hyperparameter selection on the target LLM, such as data mixture proportions. Secondly, viewing the LLM pre-training dynamics from the token position granularity provides some insights to enhance the understanding of LLM pre-training.

  While large language models demonstrate impressive performance on static benchmarks, the true potential of large language models as self-learning and reasoning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates the efficacy of self-reflection, heuristic mutation, and planning as prompting techniques to test the adaptive capabilities of agents. We conduct experiments with various open-source language models in dynamic environments and find that larger models generally outperform smaller ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, a too-long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks, while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops. Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits persistent limitations in crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and spatial coordination, suggesting that current-generation large language models still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while reasoning methods like Chain of thought improves multi-step reasoning on math word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important shortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move beyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.

  Taiwanese China Studies (CS) has developed into a rich, interdisciplinary research field shaped by the unique geopolitical position and long standing academic engagement with Mainland China. This study responds to the growing need to systematically revisit and reorganize decades of Taiwan based CS scholarship by proposing an AI assisted approach that transforms unstructured academic texts into structured, interactive knowledge representations. We apply generative AI (GAI) techniques and large language models (LLMs) to extract and standardize entity relation triples from 1,367 peer reviewed CS articles published between 1996 and 2019. These triples are then visualized through a lightweightthis http URLbased system, forming the foundation of a domain specific knowledge graph and vector database for the field. This infrastructure allows users to explore conceptual nodes and semantic relationships across the corpus, revealing previously uncharted intellectual trajectories, thematic clusters, and research gaps. By decomposing textual content into graph structured knowledge units, our system enables a paradigm shift from linear text consumption to network based knowledge navigation. In doing so, it enhances scholarly access to CS literature while offering a scalable, data driven alternative to traditional ontology construction. This work not only demonstrates how generative AI can augment area studies and digital humanities but also highlights its potential to support a reimagined scholarly infrastructure for regional knowledge systems.

  This study critically distinguishes between AI Agents and Agentic AI, offering a structured conceptual taxonomy, application mapping, and challenge analysis to clarify their divergent design philosophies and capabilities. We begin by outlining the search strategy and foundational definitions, characterizing AI Agents as modular systems driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Image Models (LIMs) for narrow, task-specific automation. Generative AI is positioned as a precursor, with AI Agents advancing through tool integration, prompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements. In contrast, Agentic AI systems represent a paradigmatic shift marked by multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and orchestrated autonomy. Through a sequential evaluation of architectural evolution, operational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, we present a comparative analysis across both paradigms. Application domains such as customer support, scheduling, and data summarization are contrasted with Agentic AI deployments in research automation, robotic coordination, and medical decision support. We further examine unique challenges in each paradigm including hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination failure and propose targeted solutions such as ReAct loops, RAG, orchestration layers, and causal modeling. This work aims to provide a definitive roadmap for developing robust, scalable, and explainable AI agent and Agentic AI-driven systems. >AI Agents, Agent-driven, Vision-Language-Models, Agentic AI Decision Support System, Agentic-AI Applications

  LLM-based multi-agent has gained significant attention for their potential in simulation and enhancing performance. However, existing works are limited to pure simulations or are constrained by predefined workflows, restricting their applicability and effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Agent Scaling Simulation (MASS) for portfolio construction. MASS achieves stable and continuous excess returns by progressively increasing the number of agents for large-scale simulations to gain a superior understanding of the market and optimizing agent distribution end-to-end through a reverse optimization process, rather than relying on a fixed workflow. We demonstrate its superiority through performance experiments, ablation studies, backtesting experiments, experiments on updated data and stock pools, scaling experiments, parameter sensitivity experiments, and visualization experiments, conducted in comparison with 6 state-of-the-art baselines on 3 challenging A-share stock pools. We expect the paradigm established by MASS to expand to other tasks with similar characteristics. The implementation of MASS has been open-sourced atthis https URL.

  The ReAct (Reasoning + Action) capability in large language models (LLMs) has become the foundation of modern agentic systems. Recent LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1/o3, exemplify this by emphasizing reasoning through the generation of ample intermediate tokens, which help build a strong premise before producing the final output tokens. In this paper, we introduce Pre-Act, a novel approach that enhances the agent's performance by creating a multi-step execution plan along with the detailed reasoning for the given user input. This plan incrementally incorporates previous steps and tool outputs, refining itself after each step execution until the final response is obtained. Our approach is applicable to both conversational and non-conversational agents. To measure the performance of task-oriented agents comprehensively, we propose a two-level evaluation framework: (1) turn level and (2) end-to-end. Our turn-level evaluation, averaged across five models, shows that our approach, Pre-Act, outperforms ReAct by 70% in Action Recall on the Almita dataset. While this approach is effective for larger models, smaller models crucial for practical applications, where latency and cost are key constraints, often struggle with complex reasoning tasks required for agentic systems. To address this limitation, we fine-tune relatively small models such as Llama 3.1 (8B & 70B) using the proposed Pre-Act approach. Our experiments show that the fine-tuned 70B model outperforms GPT-4, achieving a 69.5% improvement in action accuracy (turn-level) and a 28% improvement in goal completion rate (end-to-end) on the Almita (out-of-domain) dataset.

  Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to automatically produce diagnostic reports from medical images, with the potential to enhance clinical workflows and reduce radiologists' workload. While recent approaches leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have achieved strong results, they continue to face challenges such as factual inconsistency, hallucination, and cross-modal misalignment. We propose a multimodal multi-agent framework for RRG that aligns with the stepwise clinical reasoning workflow, where task-specific agents handle retrieval, draft generation, visual analysis, refinement, and synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms a strong baseline in both automatic metrics and LLM-based evaluations, producing more accurate, structured, and interpretable reports. This work highlights the potential of clinically aligned multi-agent frameworks to support explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications.

  Generating SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) from natural language specifications remains a major challenge in formal verification (FV) due to the inherent ambiguity and incompleteness of specifications. Existing LLM-based approaches, such as AssertLLM, focus on extracting information solely from specification documents, often failing to capture essential internal signal interactions and design details present in the RTL code, leading to incomplete or incorrect assertions. We propose a novel approach that constructs a Knowledge Graph (KG) from both specifications and RTL, using a hardware-specific schema with domain-specific entity and relation types. We create an initial KG from the specification and then systematically fuse it with information extracted from the RTL code, resulting in a unified, comprehensive KG. This combined representation enables a more thorough understanding of the design and allows for a multi-resolution context synthesis process which is designed to extract diverse verification contexts from the KG. Experiments on four designs demonstrate that our method significantly enhances SVA quality over prior methods. This structured representation not only improves FV but also paves the way for future research in tasks like code generation and design understanding.

  We demonstrate LLM agent specification gaming by instructing models to win against a chess engine. We find reasoning models like OpenAI o3 and DeepSeek R1 will often hack the benchmark by default, while language models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet need to be told that normal play won't work to hack.We improve upon prior work like (Hubinger et al., 2024; Meinke et al., 2024; Weij et al., 2024) by using realistic task prompts and avoiding excess nudging. Our results suggest reasoning models may resort to hacking to solve difficult problems, as observed in OpenAI (2024)'s o1 Docker escape during cyber capabilities testing.

  Advancements in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have created a promising foundation for developing autonomous agents. With the right tools, these agents could learn to solve tasks in new environments by accumulating and updating their knowledge. Current LLM-based agents process past experiences using a full history of observations, summarization, retrieval augmentation. However, these unstructured memory representations do not facilitate the reasoning and planning essential for complex decision-making. In our study, we introduce AriGraph, a novel method wherein the agent constructs and updates a memory graph that integrates semantic and episodic memories while exploring the environment. We demonstrate that our Ariadne LLM agent, consisting of the proposed memory architecture augmented with planning and decision-making, effectively handles complex tasks within interactive text game environments difficult even for human players. Results show that our approach markedly outperforms other established memory methods and strong RL baselines in a range of problems of varying complexity. Additionally, AriGraph demonstrates competitive performance compared to dedicated knowledge graph-based methods in static multi-hop question-answering.
