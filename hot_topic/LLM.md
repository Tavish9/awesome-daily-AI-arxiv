- **[Building Knowledge from Interactions: An LLM-Based Architecture for Adaptive Tutoring and Social Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01588)**  `arXiv:2504.01588`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Luca Garello, Giulia Belgiovine, Gabriele Russo, Francesco Rea, Alessandra Sciutti_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Integrating robotics into everyday scenarios like tutoring or physical training requires robots capable of adaptive, socially engaging, and goal-oriented interactions. While Large Language Models show promise in human-like communication, their standalone use is hindered by memory constraints and contextual incoherence. This work presents a multimodal, cognitively inspired framework that enhances LLM-based autonomous decision-making in social and task-oriented Human-Robot Interaction. Specifically, we develop an LLM-based agent for a robot trainer, balancing social conversation with task guidance and goal-driven motivation. To further enhance autonomy and personalization, we introduce a memory system for selecting, storing and retrieving experiences, facilitating generalized reasoning based on knowledge built across different interactions. A preliminary HRI user study and offline experiments with a synthetic dataset validate our approach, demonstrating the system's ability to manage complex interactions, autonomously drive training tasks, and build and retrieve contextual memories, advancing socially intelligent robotics.

- **[Bench4Merge: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Merging in Realistic Dense Traffic with Micro-Interactive Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15912)**  `arXiv:2410.15912`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  While the capabilities of autonomous driving have advanced rapidly, merging into dense traffic remains a significant challenge, many motion planning methods for this scenario have been proposed but it is hard to evaluate them. Most existing closed-loop simulators rely on rule-based controls for other vehicles, which results in a lack of diversity and randomness, thus failing to accurately assess the motion planning capabilities in highly interactive scenarios. Moreover, traditional evaluation metrics are insufficient for comprehensively evaluating the performance of merging in dense traffic. In response, we proposed a closed-loop evaluation benchmark for assessing motion planning capabilities in merging scenarios. Our approach involves other vehicles trained in large scale datasets with micro-behavioral characteristics that significantly enhance the complexity and diversity. Additionally, we have restructured the evaluation mechanism by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess each autonomous vehicle merging onto the main lane. Extensive experiments and test-vehicle deployment have demonstrated the progressiveness of this benchmark. Through this benchmark, we have obtained an evaluation of existing methods and identified common issues. The simulation environment and evaluation process can be accessed atthis https URL.

- **[Plan-and-Act using Large Language Models for Interactive Agreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01252)**  `arXiv:2504.01252`  `cs.RO`  
  _Kazuhiro Sasabuchi, Naoki Wake, Atsushi Kanehira, Jun Takamatsu, Katsushi Ikeuchi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent large language models (LLMs) are capable of planning robot actions. In this paper, we explore how LLMs can be used for planning actions with tasks involving situational human-robot interaction (HRI). A key problem of applying LLMs in situational HRI is balancing between "respecting the current human's activity" and "prioritizing the robot's task," as well as understanding the timing of when to use the LLM to generate an action plan. In this paper, we propose a necessary plan-and-act skill design to solve the above problems. We show that a critical factor for enabling a robot to switch between passive / active interaction behavior is to provide the LLM with an action text about the current robot's action. We also show that a second-stage question to the LLM (about the next timing to call the LLM) is necessary for planning actions at an appropriate timing. The skill design is applied to an Engage skill and is tested on four distinct interaction scenarios. We show that by using the skill design, LLMs can be leveraged to easily scale to different HRI scenarios with a reasonable success rate reaching 90% on the test scenarios.

- **[A Model-Agnostic Approach for Semantically Driven Disambiguation in Human-Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17004)**  `arXiv:2409.17004`  `cs.RO`  
  _Fethiye Irmak Dogan, Maithili Patel, Weiyu Liu, Iolanda Leite, Sonia Chernova_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ambiguities are inevitable in human-robot interaction, especially when a robot follows user instructions in a large, shared space. For example, if a user asks the robot to find an object in a home environment with underspecified instructions, the object could be in multiple locations depending on missing factors. For instance, a bowl might be in the kitchen cabinet or on the dining room table, depending on whether it is clean or dirty, full or empty, and the presence of other objects around it. Previous works on object search have assumed that the queried object is immediately visible to the robot or have predicted object locations using one-shot inferences, which are likely to fail for ambiguous or partially understood instructions. This paper focuses on these gaps and presents a novel model-agnostic approach leveraging semantically driven clarifications to enhance the robot's ability to locate queried objects in fewer attempts. Specifically, we leverage different knowledge embedding models, and when ambiguities arise, we propose an informative clarification method, which follows an iterative prediction process. The user experiment evaluation of our method shows that our approach is applicable to different custom semantic encoders as well as LLMs, and informative clarifications improve performances, enabling the robot to locate objects on its first attempts. The user experiment data is publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[Interpretable Steering of Large Language Models with Feature Guided Activation Additions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09929)**  `arXiv:2501.09929`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective and reliable control over large language model (LLM) behavior is a significant challenge. While activation steering methods, which add steering vectors to a model's hidden states, are a promising approach, existing techniques often lack precision and interpretability in how they influence model outputs. We introduce Feature Guided Activation Additions (FGAA), a novel activation steering method that leverages insights from Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and Sparse Autoencoder-Targeted Steering (SAE-TS). By operating in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) and employing optimization techniques to select desired SAE features, FGAA constructs precise steering vectors that provide better steering effects while maintaining coherence of steered model outputs. In this regard, evaluations on Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B models across various steering tasks demonstrate that FGAA outperforms existing steering methods of CAA, SAE decoder steering, and SAE-TS. Our results also highlight important trade-offs between steering scale and general model capabilities that are consistent across all tested steering methods.

- **[Interpreting Emergent Planning in Model-Free Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01871)**  `arXiv:2504.01871`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Thomas Bush, Stephen Chung, Usman Anwar, Adri√† Garriga-Alonso, David Krueger_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present the first mechanistic evidence that model-free reinforcement learning agents can learn to plan. This is achieved by applying a methodology based on concept-based interpretability to a model-free agent in Sokoban -- a commonly used benchmark for studying planning. Specifically, we demonstrate that DRC, a generic model-free agent introduced by Guez et al. (2019), uses learned concept representations to internally formulate plans that both predict the long-term effects of actions on the environment and influence action selection. Our methodology involves: (1) probing for planning-relevant concepts, (2) investigating plan formation within the agent's representations, and (3) verifying that discovered plans (in the agent's representations) have a causal effect on the agent's behavior through interventions. We also show that the emergence of these plans coincides with the emergence of a planning-like property: the ability to benefit from additional test-time compute. Finally, we perform a qualitative analysis of the planning algorithm learned by the agent and discover a strong resemblance to parallelized bidirectional search. Our findings advance understanding of the internal mechanisms underlying planning behavior in agents, which is important given the recent trend of emergent planning and reasoning capabilities in LLMs through RL

- **[TS-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Time Series Foundation Models are Stronger Zero-Shot Forecaster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07649)**  `arXiv:2503.07649`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Kanghui Ning, Zijie Pan, Yu Liu, Yushan Jiang, James Y. Zhang, Kashif Rasul, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) have become prevalent for time series forecasting tasks. However, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for forecasting enables the adaptation to specific domains but may not generalize well across diverse, unseen datasets. Meanwhile, existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) lack inherent mechanisms for domain adaptation and suffer from limited interpretability, making them suboptimal for zero-shot forecasting. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation based time series forecasting framework that enhances the generalization capability and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant time series segments from a dedicated knowledge database, incorporating contextual patterns for the given time series query. Next, we develop a learnable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based augmentation module, which dynamically fuses retrieved time series patterns with the TSFM's representation of the input query, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming TSFMs by up to 6.51% across diverse domains and showcasing desired interpretability.

- **[Analysis of an Idealized Stochastic Polyak Method and its Application to Black-Box Model Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01898)**  `arXiv:2504.01898`  `cs.LG`  
  _Robert M. Gower, Guillaume Garrigos, Nicolas Loizou, Dimitris Oikonomou, Konstantin Mishchenko, Fabian Schaipp_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We provide a general convergence theorem of an idealized stochastic Polyak step size called SPS$^*$. Besides convexity, we only assume a local expected gradient bound, that includes locally smooth and locally Lipschitz losses as special cases. We refer to SPS$^*$ as idealized because it requires access to the loss for every training batch evaluated at a solution. It is also ideal, in that it achieves the optimal lower bound for globally Lipschitz function, and is the first Polyak step size to have an $O(1/\sqrt{t})$ anytime convergence in the smooth setting. We show how to combine SPS$^*$ with momentum to achieve the same favorable rates for the last iterate. We conclude with several experiments to validate our theory, and a more practical setting showing how we can distill a teacher GPT-2 model into a smaller student model without any hyperparameter tuning.

- **[V2V-LLM: Vehicle-to-Vehicle Cooperative Autonomous Driving with Multi-Modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09980)**  `arXiv:2502.09980`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Hsu-kuang Chiu, Ryo Hachiuma, Chien-Yi Wang, Stephen F. Smith, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Min-Hung Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current autonomous driving vehicles rely mainly on their individual sensors to understand surrounding scenes and plan for future trajectories, which can be unreliable when the sensors are malfunctioning or occluded. To address this problem, cooperative perception methods via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication have been proposed, but they have tended to focus on perception tasks like detection or tracking. How those approaches contribute to overall cooperative planning performance is still under-explored. Inspired by recent progress using Large Language Models (LLMs) to build autonomous driving systems, we propose a novel problem setting that integrates a Multi-Modal LLM into cooperative autonomous driving, with the proposed Vehicle-to-Vehicle Question-Answering (V2V-QA) dataset and benchmark. We also propose our baseline method Vehicle-to-Vehicle Multi-Modal Large Language Model (V2V-LLM), which uses an LLM to fuse perception information from multiple connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and answer various types of driving-related questions: grounding, notable object identification, and planning. Experimental results show that our proposed V2V-LLM can be a promising unified model architecture for performing various tasks in cooperative autonomous driving, and outperforms other baseline methods that use different fusion approaches. Our work also creates a new research direction that can improve the safety of future autonomous driving systems. The code and data will be released to the public to facilitate open-source research in this field. Our project website:this https URL.

- **[DivPrune: Diversity-based Visual Token Pruning for Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02175)**  `arXiv:2503.02175`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Saeed Ranjbar Alvar, Gursimran Singh, Mohammad Akbari, Yong Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have emerged as powerful models capable of understanding various data modalities, including text, images, and videos. LMMs encode both text and visual data into tokens that are then combined and processed by an integrated Large Language Model (LLM). Including visual tokens substantially increases the total token count, often by thousands. The increased input length for LLM significantly raises the complexity of inference, resulting in high latency in LMMs. To address this issue, token pruning methods, which remove part of the visual tokens, are proposed. The existing token pruning methods either require extensive calibration and fine-tuning or rely on suboptimal importance metrics which results in increased redundancy among the retained tokens. In this paper, we first formulate token pruning as Max-Min Diversity Problem (MMDP) where the goal is to select a subset such that the diversity among the selected {tokens} is maximized. Then, we solve the MMDP to obtain the selected subset and prune the rest. The proposed method, DivPrune, reduces redundancy and achieves the highest diversity of the selected tokens. By ensuring high diversity, the selected tokens better represent the original tokens, enabling effective performance even at high pruning ratios without requiring fine-tuning. Extensive experiments with various LMMs show that DivPrune achieves state-of-the-art accuracy over 16 image- and video-language datasets. Additionally, DivPrune reduces both the end-to-end latency and GPU memory usage for the tested models. The code is available $\href{this https URL}{\text{here}}$.

- **[On Data Synthesis and Post-training for Visual Abstract Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01324)**  `arXiv:2504.01324`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Ke Zhu, Yu Wang, Jiangjiang Liu, Qunyi Xie, Shanshan Liu, Gang Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper is a pioneering work attempting to address abstract visual reasoning (AVR) problems for large vision-language models (VLMs). We make a common LLaVA-NeXT 7B model capable of perceiving and reasoning about specific AVR problems, surpassing both open-sourced (e.g., Qwen-2-VL-72B) and closed-sourced powerful VLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) with significant margin. This is a great breakthrough since almost all previous VLMs fail or show nearly random performance on representative AVR benchmarks. Our key success is our innovative data synthesis and post-training process, aiming to fully relieve the task difficulty and elicit the model to learn, step by step. Our 7B model is also shown to be behave well on AVR without sacrificing common multimodal comprehension abilities. We hope our paper could serve as an early effort in this area and would inspire further research in abstract visual reasoning.

- **[Olympus: A Universal Task Router for Computer Vision Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09612)**  `arXiv:2412.09612`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Yuanze Lin, Yunsheng Li, Dongdong Chen, Weijian Xu, Ronald Clark, Philip H. S. Torr_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Olympus, a new approach that transforms Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into a unified framework capable of handling a wide array of computer vision tasks. Utilizing a controller MLLM, Olympus delegates over 20 specialized tasks across images, videos, and 3D objects to dedicated modules. This instruction-based routing enables complex workflows through chained actions without the need for training heavy generative models. Olympus easily integrates with existing MLLMs, expanding their capabilities with comparable performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Olympus achieves an average routing accuracy of 94.75% across 20 tasks and precision of 91.82% in chained action scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness as a universal task router that can solve a diverse range of computer vision tasks.

- **[AdPO: Enhancing the Adversarial Robustness of Large Vision-Language Models with Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01735)**  `arXiv:2504.01735`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Chaohu Liu, Tianyi Gui, Yu Liu, Linli Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4o and LLaVA, have recently witnessed remarkable advancements and are increasingly being deployed in real-world applications. However, inheriting the sensitivity of visual neural networks, LVLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can result in erroneous or malicious outputs. While existing efforts utilize adversarial fine-tuning to enhance robustness, they often suffer from performance degradation on clean inputs. In this paper, we proposes AdPO, a novel adversarial defense strategy for LVLMs based on preference optimization. For the first time, we reframe adversarial training as a preference optimization problem, aiming to enhance the model's preference for generating normal outputs on clean inputs while rejecting the potential misleading outputs for adversarial examples. Notably, AdPO achieves this by solely modifying the image encoder, e.g., CLIP ViT, resulting in superior clean and adversarial performance in a variety of downsream tasks. Considering that training involves large language models (LLMs), the computational cost increases significantly. We validate that training on smaller LVLMs and subsequently transferring to larger models can achieve competitive performance while maintaining efficiency comparable to baseline methods. Our comprehensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed AdPO, which provides a novel perspective for future adversarial defense research.

  _Zhaochen Wang, Yujun Cai, Zi Huang, Bryan Hooi, Yiwei Wang, Ming-Hsuan Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly in processing multimodal information, but their ability to reconcile conflicting signals across modalities remains underexplored. This work investigates how VLMs process ASCII art, a unique medium where textual elements collectively form visual patterns, potentially creating semantic-visual conflicts. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that systematically challenges five state-of-the-art models (including GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini) using adversarial ASCII art, where character-level semantics deliberately contradict global visual patterns. Our experiments reveal a strong text-priority bias: VLMs consistently prioritize textual information over visual patterns, with visual recognition ability declining dramatically as semantic complexity increases. Various mitigation attempts through visual parameter tuning and prompt engineering yielded only modest improvements, suggesting that this limitation requires architectural-level solutions. These findings uncover fundamental flaws in how current VLMs integrate multimodal information, providing important guidance for future model development while highlighting significant implications for content moderation systems vulnerable to adversarial examples.

- **[ILLUME+: Illuminating Unified MLLM with Dual Visual Tokenization and Diffusion Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01934)**  `arXiv:2504.01934`  `cs.CV`  
  _Runhui Huang, Chunwei Wang, Junwei Yang, Guansong Lu, Yunlong Yuan, Jianhua Han, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present ILLUME+ that leverages dual visual tokenization and a diffusion decoder to improve both deep semantic understanding and high-fidelity image generation. Existing unified models have struggled to simultaneously handle the three fundamental capabilities in a unified model: understanding, generation, and editing. Models like Chameleon and EMU3 utilize VQGAN for image discretization, due to the lack of deep semantic interaction, they lag behind specialist models like LLaVA in visual understanding tasks. To mitigate this, LaViT and ILLUME employ semantic encoders for tokenization, but they struggle with image editing due to poor texture preservation. Meanwhile, Janus series decouples the input and output image representation, limiting their abilities to seamlessly handle interleaved image-text understanding and generation. In contrast, ILLUME+ introduces a unified dual visual tokenizer, DualViTok, which preserves both fine-grained textures and text-aligned semantics while enabling a coarse-to-fine image representation strategy for multimodal understanding and generation. Additionally, we employ a diffusion model as the image detokenizer for enhanced generation quality and efficient super-resolution. ILLUME+ follows a continuous-input, discrete-output scheme within the unified MLLM and adopts a progressive training procedure that supports dynamic resolution across the vision tokenizer, MLLM, and diffusion decoder. This design allows for flexible and efficient context-aware image editing and generation across diverse tasks. ILLUME+ (3B) exhibits competitive performance against existing unified MLLMs and specialized models across multimodal understanding, generation, and editing benchmarks. With its strong performance, ILLUME+ provides a scalable and versatile foundation for future multimodal applications. Project Page:this https URL.

  _Kun Ouyang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Enhancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for video understanding is crucial yet challenging. We present Spatial-R1, a targeted approach involving two key contributions: the curation of SR, a new video spatial reasoning dataset from ScanNet with automatically generated QA pairs across seven task types, and the application of Task-Specific Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for fine-tuning. By training the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct model on SR using GRPO, Spatial-R1 significantly advances performance on the VSI-Bench benchmark, achieving a 7.4\% gain over the baseline and outperforming strong contemporary models. This work validates the effectiveness of specialized data curation and optimization techniques for improving complex spatial reasoning in video MLLMs.

  _Min Shi, Shihao Wang, Chieh-Yun Chen, Jitesh Jain, Kai Wang, Junjun Xiong, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Balancing temporal resolution and spatial detail under limited compute budget remains a key challenge for video-based multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Existing methods typically compress video representations using predefined rules before feeding them into the LLM, resulting in irreversible information loss and often ignoring input instructions. To address this, we propose a novel slow-fast architecture that naturally circumvents this trade-off, enabling the use of more input frames while preserving spatial details. Inspired by how humans first skim a video before focusing on relevant parts, our slow-fast design employs a dual-token strategy: 1) "fast" visual tokens -- a compact set of compressed video features -- are fed into the LLM alongside text embeddings to provide a quick overview; 2) "slow" visual tokens -- uncompressed video features -- are cross-attended by text embeddings through specially designed hybrid decoder layers, enabling instruction-aware extraction of relevant visual details with linear complexity. We conduct systematic exploration to optimize both the overall architecture and key components. Experiments show that our model significantly outperforms self-attention-only baselines, extending the input capacity from 16 to 128 frames with just a 3% increase in computation, and achieving a 16% average performance improvement across five video understanding benchmarks. Our 7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of similar size. Furthermore, our slow-fast architecture is a plug-and-play design that can be integrated into other video MLLMs to improve efficiency and scalability.

- **[Safeguarding Vision-Language Models: Mitigating Vulnerabilities to Gaussian Noise in Perturbation-based Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01308)**  `arXiv:2504.01308`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jiawei Wang, Yushen Zuo, Yuanjun Chai, Zhendong Liu, Yichen Fu, Yichun Feng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating visual information, yet they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, especially when processing noisy or corrupted images. Although existing VLMs adopt security measures during training to mitigate such attacks, vulnerabilities associated with noise-augmented visual inputs are overlooked. In this work, we identify that missing noise-augmented training causes critical security gaps: many VLMs are susceptible to even simple perturbations such as Gaussian noise. To address this challenge, we propose Robust-VLGuard, a multimodal safety dataset with aligned / misaligned image-text pairs, combined with noise-augmented fine-tuning that reduces attack success rates while preserving functionality of VLM. For stronger optimization-based visual perturbation attacks, we propose DiffPure-VLM, leveraging diffusion models to convert adversarial perturbations into Gaussian-like noise, which can be defended by VLMs with noise-augmented safety fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the distribution-shifting property of diffusion model aligns well with our fine-tuned VLMs, significantly mitigating adversarial perturbations across varying intensities. The dataset and code are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) struggle with puzzles, which require precise perception, rule comprehension, and logical reasoning. Assessing and enhancing their performance in this domain is crucial, as it reflects their ability to engage in structured reasoning - an essential skill for real-world problem-solving. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate pre-trained models without additional training or fine-tuning, often lack a dedicated focus on reasoning, and fail to establish a systematic evaluation framework. To address these limitations, we introduce VGRP-Bench, a Visual Grid Reasoning Puzzle Benchmark featuring 20 diverse puzzles. VGRP-Bench spans multiple difficulty levels, and includes extensive experiments not only on existing chat LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), but also on reasoning LVLMs (e.g., Gemini-Thinking). Our results reveal that even the state-of-the-art LVLMs struggle with these puzzles, highlighting fundamental limitations in their puzzle-solving capabilities. Most importantly, through systematic experiments, we identify and analyze key factors influencing LVLMs' puzzle-solving performance, including the number of clues, grid size, and rule complexity. Furthermore, we explore two Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies that can be used in post-training: SFT on solutions (S-SFT) and SFT on synthetic reasoning processes (R-SFT). While both methods significantly improve performance on trained puzzles, they exhibit limited generalization to unseen ones. We will release VGRP-Bench to facilitate further research on LVLMs for complex, real-world problem-solving. Project page:this https URL.

  _Yuqing Wang, Tianwei Xiong, Daquan Zhou, Zhijie Lin, Yang Zhao, Bingyi Kang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  It is desirable but challenging to generate content-rich long videos in the scale of minutes. Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in generating coherent and long sequences of tokens in the domain of natural language processing, while the exploration of autoregressive LLMs for video generation is limited to generating short videos of several seconds. In this work, we conduct a deep analysis of the challenges that prevent autoregressive LLM-based video generators from generating long videos. Based on the observations and analysis, we propose Loong, a new autoregressive LLM-based video generator that can generate minute-long videos. Specifically, we model the text tokens and video tokens as a unified sequence for autoregressive LLMs and train the model from scratch. We propose progressive short-to-long training with a loss re-weighting scheme to mitigate the loss imbalance problem for long video training. We further investigate inference strategies, including video token re-encoding and sampling strategies, to diminish error accumulation during inference. Our proposed Loong can be trained on 10-second videos and be extended to generate minute-level long videos conditioned on text prompts, as demonstrated by the results.

- **[CoMM: A Coherent Interleaved Image-Text Dataset for Multimodal Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10462)**  `arXiv:2406.10462`  `cs.CV`  
  _Wei Chen, Lin Li, Yongqi Yang, Bin Wen, Fan Yang, Tingting Gao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Interleaved image-text generation has emerged as a crucial multimodal task, aiming at creating sequences of interleaved visual and textual content given a query. Despite notable advancements in recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs), generating integrated image-text sequences that exhibit narrative coherence and entity and style consistency remains challenging due to poor training data quality. To address this gap, we introduce CoMM, a high-quality Coherent interleaved image-text MultiModal dataset designed to enhance the coherence, consistency, and alignment of generated multimodal content. Initially, CoMM harnesses raw data from diverse sources, focusing on instructional content and visual storytelling, establishing a foundation for coherent and consistent content. To further refine the data quality, we devise a multi-perspective filter strategy that leverages advanced pre-trained models to ensure the development of sentences, consistency of inserted images, and semantic alignment between them. Various quality evaluation metrics are designed to prove the high quality of the filtered dataset. Meanwhile, extensive few-shot experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate CoMM's effectiveness in significantly enhancing the in-context learning capabilities of MLLMs. Moreover, we propose four new tasks to evaluate MLLMs' interleaved generation abilities, supported by a comprehensive evaluation framework. We believe CoMM opens a new avenue for advanced MLLMs with superior multimodal in-context learning and understanding ability.

  This survey presents a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenon of hallucination in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), also known as Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which have demonstrated significant advancements and remarkable abilities in multimodal tasks. Despite these promising developments, MLLMs often generate outputs that are inconsistent with the visual content, a challenge known as hallucination, which poses substantial obstacles to their practical deployment and raises concerns regarding their reliability in real-world applications. This problem has attracted increasing attention, prompting efforts to detect and mitigate such inaccuracies. We review recent advances in identifying, evaluating, and mitigating these hallucinations, offering a detailed overview of the underlying causes, evaluation benchmarks, metrics, and strategies developed to address this issue. Additionally, we analyze the current challenges and limitations, formulating open questions that delineate potential pathways for future research. By drawing the granular classification and landscapes of hallucination causes, evaluation benchmarks, and mitigation methods, this survey aims to deepen the understanding of hallucinations in MLLMs and inspire further advancements in the field. Through our thorough and in-depth review, we contribute to the ongoing dialogue on enhancing the robustness and reliability of MLLMs, providing valuable insights and resources for researchers and practitioners alike.

  Recent advances in text-to-3D creation integrate the potent prior of Diffusion Models from text-to-image generation into 3D domain. Nevertheless, generating 3D scenes with multiple objects remains challenging. Therefore, we present DreamScape, a method for generating 3D scenes from text. Utilizing Gaussian Splatting for 3D representation, DreamScape introduces 3D Gaussian Guide that encodes semantic primitives, spatial transformations and relationships from text using LLMs, enabling local-to-global optimization. Progressive scale control is tailored during local object generation, addressing training instability issue arising from simple blending in the global optimization stage. Collision relationships between objects are modeled at the global level to mitigate biases in LLMs priors, ensuring physical correctness. Additionally, to generate pervasive objects like rain and snow distributed extensively across the scene, we design specialized sparse initialization and densification strategy. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScape achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling high-fidelity, controllable 3D scene generation.

  _Boshi Wang, Huan Sun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs exhibit a basic generalization failure known as the Reversal Curse, where they struggle to learn reversible factual associations. Understanding why this occurs could help identify weaknesses in current models and advance their generalization and robustness. In this paper, we conjecture that the Reversal Curse in LLMs is a manifestation of the long-standing binding problem in cognitive science, neuroscience and AI. Specifically, we identify two primary causes of the Reversal Curse stemming from transformers' limitations in conceptual binding: the inconsistency and entanglements of concept representations. We perform a series of experiments that support these conjectures. Our exploration leads to a model design based on JEPA (Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture) that for the first time breaks the Reversal Curse without side-stepping it with specialized data augmentation or non-causal masking, and moreover, generalization could be further improved by incorporating special memory layers that support disentangled concept representations. We demonstrate that the skill of reversal unlocks a new kind of memory integration that enables models to solve large-scale arithmetic reasoning problems via parametric forward-chaining, outperforming frontier LLMs based on non-parametric memory and prolonged explicit reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tool learning, which allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage external tools for solving complex user tasks, has emerged as a promising avenue for extending model capabilities. However, current approaches primarily focus on data synthesis for fine-tuning LLMs to invoke tools effectively, largely ignoring how to fully stimulate the potential of the model. In this paper, we propose ToolACE-R, a novel method that introduces adaptive self-refinement for tool invocations. Our approach features a model-aware iterative training procedure that progressively incorporates more training samples based on the model's evolving capabilities. Additionally, it allows LLMs to iteratively refine their tool calls, optimizing performance without requiring external feedback. To further enhance computational efficiency, we integrate an adaptive mechanism when scaling the inference time, enabling the model to autonomously determine when to stop the refinement process. We conduct extensive experiments across several benchmark datasets, showing that ToolACE-R achieves competitive performance compared to advanced API-based models, even without any refinement. Furthermore, its performance can be further improved efficiently through adaptive self-refinement. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is compatible with base models of various sizes, offering a promising direction for more efficient tool learning.

  Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains underdiagnosed in clinical settings, presenting opportunities for automated detection to identify patients. This study evaluates natural language processing approaches for detecting PTSD from clinical interview transcripts. We compared general and mental health-specific transformer models (BERT/RoBERTa), embedding-based methods (SentenceBERT/LLaMA), and large language model prompting strategies (zero-shot/few-shot/chain-of-thought) using the DAIC-WOZ dataset. Domain-specific models significantly outperformed general models (Mental-RoBERTa F1=0.643 vs. RoBERTa-base 0.485). LLaMA embeddings with neural networks achieved the highest performance (F1=0.700). Zero-shot prompting using DSM-5 criteria yielded competitive results without training data (F1=0.657). Performance varied significantly across symptom severity and comorbidity status, with higher accuracy for severe PTSD cases and patients with comorbid depression. Our findings highlight the potential of domain-adapted embeddings and LLMs for scalable screening while underscoring the need for improved detection of nuanced presentations and offering insights for developing clinically viable AI tools for PTSD assessment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automatic text classification (ATC) has experienced remarkable advancements in the past decade, best exemplified by recent small and large language models (SLMs and LLMs), leveraged by Transformer architectures. Despite recent effectiveness improvements, a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis investigating whether the effectiveness gains of these recent approaches compensate their much higher costs when compared to more traditional text classification approaches such as SVMs and Logistic Regression is still missing in the literature. In this context, this work's main contributions are twofold: (i) we provide a scientifically sound comparative analysis of the cost-benefit of twelve traditional and recent ATC solutions including five open LLMs, and (ii) a large benchmark comprising {22 datasets}, including sentiment analysis and topic classification, with their (train-validation-test) partitions based on folded cross-validation procedures, along with documentation, and code. The release of code, data, and documentation enables the community to replicate experiments and advance the field in a more scientifically sound manner. Our comparative experimental results indicate that LLMs outperform traditional approaches (up to 26%-7.1% on average) and SLMs (up to 4.9%-1.9% on average) in terms of effectiveness. However, LLMs incur significantly higher computational costs due to fine-tuning, being, on average 590x and 8.5x slower than traditional methods and SLMs, respectively. Results suggests the following recommendations: (1) LLMs for applications that require the best possible effectiveness and can afford the costs; (2) traditional methods such as Logistic Regression and SVM for resource-limited applications or those that cannot afford the cost of tuning large LLMs; and (3) SLMs like Roberta for near-optimal effectiveness-efficiency trade-off.

  The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly reshaped the landscape of machine translation (MT), particularly for low-resource languages and domains that lack sufficient parallel corpora, linguistic tools, and computational infrastructure. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of recent progress in leveraging LLMs for MT. We analyze techniques such as few-shot prompting, cross-lingual transfer, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning that enable effective adaptation to under-resourced settings. The paper also explores synthetic data generation strategies using LLMs, including back-translation and lexical augmentation. Additionally, we compare LLM-based translation with traditional encoder-decoder models across diverse language pairs, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each. We discuss persistent challenges such as hallucinations, evaluation inconsistencies, and inherited biases while also evaluating emerging LLM-driven metrics for translation quality. This survey offers practical insights and outlines future directions for building robust, inclusive, and scalable MT systems in the era of large-scale generative models.

  This paper introduces STAR-1, a high-quality, just-1k-scale safety dataset specifically designed for large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1. Built on three core principles -- diversity, deliberative reasoning, and rigorous filtering -- STAR-1 aims to address the critical needs for safety alignment in LRMs. Specifically, we begin by integrating existing open-source safety datasets from diverse sources. Then, we curate safety policies to generate policy-grounded deliberative reasoning samples. Lastly, we apply a GPT-4o-based safety scoring system to select training examples aligned with best practices. Experimental results show that fine-tuning LRMs with STAR-1 leads to an average 40% improvement in safety performance across four benchmarks, while only incurring a marginal decrease (e.g., an average of 1.1%) in reasoning ability measured across five reasoning tasks. Extensive ablation studies further validate the importance of our design principles in constructing STAR-1 and analyze its efficacy across both LRMs and traditional LLMs. Our project page isthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-thought (CoT) has emerged as a critical mechanism for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), with self-consistency demonstrating notable promise in boosting performance. However, inherent linguistic biases in multilingual training corpora frequently cause semantic drift and logical inconsistencies, especially in sub-10B parameter LLMs handling complex inference tasks. To overcome these constraints, we propose the Cross-Lingual Consistency (CLC) framework, an innovative inference paradigm that integrates multilingual reasoning paths through majority voting to elevate LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Empirical evaluations on the CMATH dataset reveal CLC's superiority over the conventional self-consistency method, delivering 9.5%, 6.5%, and 6.0% absolute accuracy gains for DeepSeek-Math-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct, and Gemma2-9B-Instruct respectively. Expanding CLC's linguistic scope to 11 diverse languages implies two synergistic benefits: 1) neutralizing linguistic biases in multilingual training corpora through multilingual ensemble voting, 2) escaping monolingual reasoning traps by exploring the broader multilingual solution space. This dual benefits empirically enables more globally optimal reasoning paths compared to monolingual self-consistency baselines, as evidenced by the 4.1%-18.5% accuracy gains using Gemma2-9B-Instruct on the MGSM dataset.

  Evaluating large language models (LLMs) effectively remains a critical bottleneck, as traditional static benchmarks suffer from saturation and contamination, while human evaluations are costly and slow. This hinders timely or domain-specific assessment, crucial for real-world applications. We introduce YourBench, a novel, open-source framework that addresses these limitations by enabling dynamic, automated generation of reliable, up-to-date, and domain-tailored benchmarks cheaply and without manual annotation, directly from user-provided documents. We demonstrate its efficacy by replicating 7 diverse MMLU subsets using minimal source text, achieving this for under 15 USD in total inference costs while perfectly preserving the relative model performance rankings (Spearman Rho = 1) observed on the original benchmark. To ensure that YourBench generates data grounded in provided input instead of relying on posterior parametric knowledge in models, we also introduce Tempora-0325, a novel dataset of over 7K diverse documents, published exclusively after March 2025. Our comprehensive analysis spans 26 SoTA models from 7 major families across varying scales (3-671B parameters) to validate the quality of generated evaluations through rigorous algorithmic checks (e.g., citation grounding) and human assessments. We release the YourBench library, the Tempora-0325 dataset, 150k+ question answer pairs based on Tempora and all evaluation and inference traces to facilitate reproducible research and empower the community to generate bespoke benchmarks on demand, fostering more relevant and trustworthy LLM evaluation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-context learning (ICL) is critical for large language models (LLMs), but its effectiveness is constrained by finite context windows, particularly in ultra-long contexts. To overcome this, we introduce InfiniteICL, a framework that parallels context and parameters in LLMs with short- and long-term memory in human cognitive systems, focusing on transforming temporary context knowledge into permanent parameter updates. This approach significantly reduces memory usage, maintains robust performance across varying input lengths, and theoretically enables infinite context integration through the principles of context knowledge elicitation, selection, and consolidation. Evaluations demonstrate that our method reduces context length by 90% while achieving 103% average performance of full-context prompting across fact recall, grounded reasoning, and skill acquisition tasks. When conducting sequential multi-turn transformations on complex, real-world contexts (with length up to 2M tokens), our approach surpasses full-context prompting while using only 0.4% of the original contexts. These findings highlight InfiniteICL's potential to enhance the scalability and efficiency of LLMs by breaking the limitations of conventional context window sizes.

  Recent advancements in rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), applied during the post-training phase of large language models (LLMs), have significantly enhanced their capabilities in structured reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logical inference. However, the effectiveness of RL in social reasoning, particularly in Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' mental states, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that RL methods effectively unlock ToM reasoning capabilities even in small-scale LLMs (0.5B to 7B parameters). Using a modest dataset comprising 3200 questions across diverse scenarios, our RL-trained 7B model achieves 84.50\% accuracy on the Hi-ToM benchmark, surpassing models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-v3 despite significantly fewer parameters. While smaller models ($\leq$3B parameters) suffer from reasoning collapse, larger models (7B parameters) maintain stable performance through consistent belief tracking. Additionally, our RL-based models demonstrate robust generalization to higher-order, out-of-distribution ToM problems, novel textual presentations, and previously unseen datasets. These findings highlight RL's potential to enhance social cognitive reasoning, bridging the gap between structured problem-solving and nuanced social inference in LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has recently been explored to enhance the capabilities of Text Attribute Graphs (TAGs). Most existing methods feed textual descriptions of the graph structure or neighbouring nodes' text directly into LLMs. However, these approaches often cause LLMs to treat structural information simply as general contextual text, thus limiting their effectiveness in graph-related tasks. In this paper, we introduce LanSAGNN (Language Semantic Anisotropic Graph Neural Network), a framework that extends the concept of anisotropic GNNs to the natural language level. This model leverages LLMs to extract tailor-made semantic information for node pairs, effectively capturing the unique interactions within node relationships. In addition, we propose an efficient dual-layer LLMs finetuning architecture to better align LLMs' outputs with graph tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LanSAGNN significantly enhances existing LLM-based methods without increasing complexity while also exhibiting strong robustness against interference.

  In an era where AI-driven hiring is transforming recruitment practices, concerns about fairness and bias have become increasingly important. To explore these issues, we introduce a benchmark, FAIRE (Fairness Assessment In Resume Evaluation), to test for racial and gender bias in large language models (LLMs) used to evaluate resumes across different industries. We use two methods-direct scoring and ranking-to measure how model performance changes when resumes are slightly altered to reflect different racial or gender identities. Our findings reveal that while every model exhibits some degree of bias, the magnitude and direction vary considerably. This benchmark provides a clear way to examine these differences and offers valuable insights into the fairness of AI-based hiring tools. It highlights the urgent need for strategies to reduce bias in AI-driven recruitment. Our benchmark code and dataset are open-sourced at our repository:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The newly released OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated that test-time scaling can significantly improve model performance, especially in complex tasks such as logical reasoning. Common test-time scaling methods involve generating more chain of thoughts (CoTs) or longer CoTs with self-correction. However, while self-correction can improve performance, it may lead to significant token waste and reduce readability of the CoT if the reasoning steps are already correct. To demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can rectify errors at a more fine-grained level, we propose Adaptive Rectification Sampling (AR-Sampling), which can guide the LLMs to self-correction at the appropriate step. AR-Sampling leverages a process-supervised reward model (PRM) as a verifier and constructed trigger sentences to guide the model in adaptive step-level rethinking. Through the experiments on GSM8K and MATH500, it indicate that our approach enables the models to rethink in more fine-grained level, improving the accuracy of solutions, while generating a reasonable number of additional tokens.

  Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful knowledge bases yet are limited by static training data, leading to issues such as hallucinations and safety risks. Editing a model's internal knowledge through the locate-and-edit paradigm has proven a cost-effective alternative to retraining, though current unstructured approaches, especially window-based autoregressive methods, often disrupt the causal dependency between early memory updates and later output tokens. In this work, we first theoretically analyze these limitations and then introduce Matryoshka Unstructured Knowledge Editing ($\mu$KE), a novel memory update mechanism that preserves such dependencies via a Matryoshka-style objective and adaptive loss coefficients. Empirical evaluations on two models across four benchmarks demonstrate that $\mu$KE improves edit efficacy by up to 12.33% over state-of-the-art methods, and remain robust when applied to diverse formatted edits, underscoring its potential for effective unstructured knowledge editing in LLMs.

  Determining faithfulness of a claim to a source document is an important problem across many domains. This task is generally treated as a binary judgment of whether the claim is supported or unsupported in relation to the source. In many cases, though, whether a claim is supported can be ambiguous. For instance, it may depend on making inferences from given evidence, and different people can reasonably interpret the claim as either supported or unsupported based on their agreement with those inferences. Forcing binary labels upon such claims lowers the reliability of evaluation. In this work, we reframe the task to manage the subjectivity involved with factuality judgments of ambiguous claims. We introduce LLM-generated edits of summaries as a method of providing a nuanced evaluation of claims: how much does a summary need to be edited to be unambiguous? Whether a claim gets rewritten and how much it changes can be used as an automatic evaluation metric, the Ambiguity Rewrite Metric (ARM), with a much richer feedback signal than a binary judgment of faithfulness. We focus on the area of narrative summarization as it is particularly rife with ambiguity and subjective interpretation. We show that ARM produces a 21% absolute improvement in annotator agreement on claim faithfulness, indicating that subjectivity is reduced.

  Large Language models (LLMs) have been prominent for language translation, including low-resource languages. There has been limited study about the assessment of the quality of translations generated by LLMs, including Gemini, GPT and Google Translate. In this study, we address this limitation by using semantic and sentiment analysis of selected LLMs for Indian languages, including Sanskrit, Telugu and Hindi. We select prominent texts that have been well translated by experts and use LLMs to generate their translations to English, and then we provide a comparison with selected expert (human) translations. Our findings suggest that while LLMs have made significant progress in translation accuracy, challenges remain in preserving sentiment and semantic integrity, especially in figurative and philosophical contexts. The sentiment analysis revealed that GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 are better at preserving the sentiments for the Bhagavad Gita (Sanskrit-English) translations when compared to Google Translate. We observed a similar trend for the case of Tamas (Hindi-English) and Maha P (Telugu-English) translations. GPT-4o performs similarly to GPT-3.5 in the translation in terms of sentiments for the three languages. We found that LLMs are generally better at translation for capturing sentiments when compared to Google Translate.

  The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of benchmarks that consider temporal dynamics, however, there remains a gap in understanding how well these models can generalize across temporal contexts due to the inherent dynamic nature of language and information. This paper introduces the concept of temporal generalization in LLMs, including bias in past and future generalizations. Then we introduce FreshBench, a new evaluation framework that employs fresh text and event prediction for assessing LLMs' temporal adaptability, ensuring the evaluation process free from data leakage and subjective bias. The experiment shows significant temporal biases and a decline in performance over time. Our findings reveal that powerful models, while initially superior, tend to decline more rapidly in future generalization. Additionally, powerful open-source models demonstrate better long-term adaptability compared to their closed-source counterparts. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Since the advent of reasoning-based large language models, many have found great success from distilling reasoning capabilities into student models. Such techniques have significantly bridged the gap between reasoning and standard LLMs on coding tasks. Despite this, much of the progress on distilling reasoning models remains locked behind proprietary datasets or lacks details on data curation, filtering and subsequent training. To address this, we construct a superior supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset that we use to achieve state-of-the-art coding capability results in models of various sizes. Our distilled models use only SFT to achieve 61.8% on LiveCodeBench and 24.6% on CodeContests, surpassing alternatives trained with reinforcement learning. We then perform analysis on the data sources used to construct our dataset, the impact of code execution filtering, and the importance of instruction/solution diversity. We observe that execution filtering negatively affected benchmark accuracy, leading us to prioritize instruction diversity over solution correctness. Finally, we also analyze the token efficiency and reasoning patterns utilized by these models. We will open-source these datasets and distilled models to the community.

  While AI agents have shown remarkable performance at various tasks, they still struggle with complex multi-modal applications, structured generation and strategic planning. Improvements via standard fine-tuning is often impractical, as solving agentic tasks usually relies on black box API access without control over model parameters. Inference-time methods such as Best-of-N (BON) sampling offer a simple yet effective alternative to improve performance. However, BON lacks iterative feedback integration mechanism. Hence, we propose Iterative Agent Decoding (IAD) which combines iterative refinement with dynamic candidate evaluation and selection guided by a verifier. IAD differs in how feedback is designed and integrated, specifically optimized to extract maximal signal from reward scores. We conduct a detailed comparison of baselines across key metrics on Sketch2Code, Text2SQL, and Webshop where IAD consistently outperforms baselines, achieving 3--6% absolute gains on Sketch2Code and Text2SQL (with and without LLM judges) and 8--10% gains on Webshop across multiple metrics. To better understand the source of IAD's gains, we perform controlled experiments to disentangle the effect of adaptive feedback from stochastic sampling, and find that IAD's improvements are primarily driven by verifier-guided refinement, not merely sampling diversity. We also show that both IAD and BON exhibit inference-time scaling with increased compute when guided by an optimal verifier. Our analysis highlights the critical role of verifier quality in effective inference-time optimization and examines the impact of noisy and sparse rewards on scaling behavior. Together, these findings offer key insights into the trade-offs and principles of effective inference-time optimization.

  Recently, building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to enhance the capability of large language models (LLMs) has become a common practice. Especially in the legal domain, previous judicial decisions play a significant role under the doctrine of stare decisis which emphasizes the importance of making decisions based on (retrieved) prior documents. However, the overall performance of RAG system depends on many components: (1) retrieval corpora, (2) retrieval algorithms, (3) rerankers, (4) LLM backbones, and (5) evaluation metrics. Here we propose LRAGE, an open-source tool for holistic evaluation of RAG systems focusing on the legal domain. LRAGE provides GUI and CLI interfaces to facilitate seamless experiments and investigate how changes in the aforementioned five components affect the overall accuracy. We validated LRAGE using multilingual legal benches including Korean (KBL), English (LegalBench), and Chinese (LawBench) by demonstrating how the overall accuracy changes when varying the five components mentioned above.

  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable multilingual capabilities despite the extreme language imbalance in the pre-training data. In this paper, we closely examine the reasons behind this phenomenon, focusing on the pre-training corpus. We find that the existence of code-switching, alternating between different languages within a context, is key to multilingual capabilities. We conduct an analysis to investigate code-switching in the pre-training corpus, examining its presence and categorizing it into four types within two quadrants. We then assess its impact on multilingual performance. These types of code-switching data are unbalanced in proportions and demonstrate different effects on facilitating language transfer. To better explore the power of code-switching for language alignment during pre-training, we investigate the strategy of synthetic code-switching. We continuously scale up the synthetic code-switching data and observe remarkable improvements in both benchmarks and representation space. Extensive experiments indicate that incorporating synthetic code-switching data enables better language alignment and generalizes well to high, medium, and low-resource languages with pre-training corpora of varying qualities.

  We present OpenThaiGPT 1.6 and R1 (OTG-1.6 and OTG-R1), Thai-centric Large Language Models (LLMs) developed through distinct methodologies to enhance generalization and reasoning capabilities. OTG-1.6 employs Task Arithmetic model merging for broad generalization, while OTG-R1 integrates multi-stage training with the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO) for advanced reasoning. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate superior performance across Thai language tasks, achieving competitive results against larger-scale open-source Thai LLMs. This paper details the proposed models, training processes, benchmarks, and results, highlighting improvements over previous models and establishing new performance standards for Thai-centric LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an increasingly important tool in research and society at large. While LLMs are regularly used all over the world by experts and lay-people alike, they are predominantly developed with English-speaking users in mind, performing well in English and other wide-spread languages while less-resourced languages such as Luxembourgish are seen as a lower priority. This lack of attention is also reflected in the sparsity of available evaluation tools and datasets. In this study, we investigate the viability of language proficiency exams as such evaluation tools for the Luxembourgish language. We find that large models such as ChatGPT, Claude and DeepSeek-R1 typically achieve high scores, while smaller models show weak performances. We also find that the performances in such language exams can be used to predict performances in other NLP tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pretraining data curation is a cornerstone in Large Language Model (LLM) development, leading to growing research on quality filtering of large web corpora. From statistical quality flags to LLM-based labeling systems, datasets are divided into categories, frequently reducing to a binary: those passing the filters deemed as valuable examples, others discarded as useless or detrimental. However, a more detailed understanding of the contribution of different kinds of texts to model performance is still largely lacking. In this article, we present the first study utilizing registers (also known as genres) - a widely used standard in corpus linguistics to model linguistic variation - to curate pretraining datasets and investigate the effect of register on the performance of LLMs. We perform comparative studies by training models with register classified data and evaluating them using standard benchmarks, and show that the register of pretraining data substantially affects model performance. We uncover surprising relationships between the pretraining material and the resulting models: using the News register results in subpar performance, and on the contrary, including the Opinion class, covering texts such as reviews and opinion blogs, is highly beneficial. While a model trained on the entire unfiltered dataset outperforms those trained on datasets limited to a single register, combining well-performing registers like How-to-Instructions, Informational Description, and Opinion leads to major improvements. Furthermore, analysis of individual benchmark results reveals key differences in the strengths and drawbacks of specific register classes as pretraining data. These findings show that register is an important explainer of model variation and can facilitate more deliberate future data selection practices.

  The best performing transformer-based language models use subword tokenization techniques, such as Byte-Pair-Encoding (BPE). However, these approaches often overlook linguistic principles, such as morphological segmentation, which we believe is fundamental for understanding language-specific word structure. In this study, we leverage an annotated Danish morphological dataset to train a semisupervised model for morphological segmentation, enabling the development of tokenizers optimized for Danish morphology. We evaluate four distinct tokenizers, including two custom morphological tokenizers, by analyzing their performance in morphologically segmenting Danish words. Additionally, we train two generative transformer models, \textit{CerebrasGPT-111M} and \textit{LLaMA-3.2 1B}, using these tokenizers and evaluate their downstream performance. Our findings reveal that our custom-developed tokenizers substantially enhance morphological segmentation, achieving an F1 score of 58.84, compared to 39.28 achieved by a Danish BPE tokenizer. In downstream tasks, models trained with our morphological tokenizers outperform those using BPE tokenizers across different evaluation metrics. These results highlight that incorporating Danish morphological segmentation strategies into tokenizers leads to improved performance in generative transformer models on Danish language

  The detrimental effects of toxicity in competitive online video games are widely acknowledged, prompting publishers to monitor player chat conversations. This is challenging due to the context-dependent nature of toxicity, often spread across multiple messages or informed by non-textual interactions. Traditional toxicity detectors focus on isolated messages, missing the broader context needed for accurate moderation. This is especially problematic in video games, where interactions involve specialized slang, abbreviations, and typos, making it difficult for standard models to detect toxicity, especially given its rarity. We adapted RoBERTa LLM to support moderation tailored to video games, integrating both textual and non-textual context. By enhancing pretrained embeddings with metadata and addressing the unique slang and language quirks through domain adaptive pretraining, our method better captures the nuances of player interactions. Using two gaming datasets - from Defense of the Ancients 2 (DOTA 2) and Call of Duty$^\circledR$: Modern Warfare$^\circledR$III (MWIII) we demonstrate which sources of context (metadata, prior interactions...) are most useful, how to best leverage them to boost performance, and the conditions conducive to doing so. This work underscores the importance of context-aware and domain-specific approaches for proactive moderation.

  Predicting future events stands as one of the ultimate aspirations of artificial intelligence. Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based systems have shown remarkable potential in forecasting future events, thereby garnering significant interest in the research community. Currently, several benchmarks have been established to evaluate the forecasting capabilities by formalizing the event prediction as a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and reasoning task. In these benchmarks, each prediction question is answered with relevant retrieved news articles. However, because there is no consideration on whether the questions can be supported by valid or sufficient supporting rationales, some of the questions in these benchmarks may be inherently noninferable. To address this issue, we introduce a new benchmark, PROPHET, which comprises inferable forecasting questions paired with relevant news for retrieval. To ensure the inferability of the benchmark, we propose Causal Intervened Likelihood (CIL), a statistical measure that assesses inferability through causal inference. In constructing this benchmark, we first collected recent trend forecasting questions and then filtered the data using CIL, resulting in an inferable benchmark for event prediction. Through extensive experiments, we first demonstrate the validity of CIL and in-depth investigations into event prediction with the aid of CIL. Subsequently, we evaluate several representative prediction systems on PROPHET, drawing valuable insights for future directions.

  This paper presents LITE, an LLM-based evaluation method designed for efficient and flexible assessment of taxonomy quality. To address challenges in large-scale taxonomy evaluation, such as efficiency, fairness, and consistency, LITE adopts a top-down hierarchical evaluation strategy, breaking down the taxonomy into manageable substructures and ensuring result reliability through cross-validation and standardized input formats. LITE also introduces a penalty mechanism to handle extreme cases and provides both quantitative performance analysis and qualitative insights by integrating evaluation metrics closely aligned with task objectives. Experimental results show that LITE demonstrates high reliability in complex evaluation tasks, effectively identifying semantic errors, logical contradictions, and structural flaws in taxonomies, while offering directions for improvement.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present ThinkPrune, a simple yet effective method for pruning the thinking length for long-thinking LLMs, which has been found to often produce inefficient and redundant thinking processes. Existing preliminary explorations of reducing thinking length primarily focus on forcing the thinking process to early exit, rather than adapting the LLM to optimize and consolidate the thinking process, and therefore the length-performance tradeoff observed so far is sub-optimal. To fill this gap, ThinkPrune offers a simple solution that continuously trains the long-thinking LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL) with an added token limit, beyond which any unfinished thoughts and answers will be discarded, resulting in a zero reward. To further preserve model performance, we introduce an iterative length pruning approach, where multiple rounds of RL are conducted, each with an increasingly more stringent token limit. We observed that ThinkPrune results in a remarkable performance-length tradeoff -- on the AIME24 dataset, the reasoning length of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B can be reduced by half with only 2% drop in performance. We also observed that after pruning, the LLMs can bypass unnecessary steps while keeping the core reasoning process complete. Code is available atthis https URL.

  _Jihyun Janice Ahn, Wenpeng Yin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While the inconsistency of LLMs is not a novel topic, prior research has predominantly addressed two types of generative inconsistencies: i) Randomness Inconsistency: running the same LLM multiple trials, yielding varying responses; ii) Paraphrase Inconsistency: paraphrased prompts result in different responses from the same LLM. Randomness Inconsistency arises from the inherent randomness due to stochastic sampling in generative models, while Paraphrase Inconsistency is a consequence of the language modeling objectives, where paraphrased prompts alter the distribution of vocabulary logits. This research discovers Prompt-Reverse Inconsistency (PRIN), a new form of LLM self-inconsistency: given a question and a couple of LLM-generated answer candidates, the LLM often has conflicting responses when prompted "Which are correct answers?" and "Which are incorrect answers?". PRIN poses a big concern as it undermines the credibility of LLM-as-a-judge, and suggests a challenge for LLMs to adhere to basic logical rules. We conduct a series of experiments to investigate PRIN, examining the extent of PRIN across different LLMs, methods to mitigate it, potential applications, and its relationship with Randomness Inconsistency and Paraphrase Inconsistency. As the first study to explore PRIN, our findings offer valuable insights into the inner workings of LLMs and contribute to advancing trustworthy AI.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advent of large language models (LLMs) in the education sector has provided impetus to automate grading short answer questions. LLMs make evaluating short answers very efficient, thus addressing issues like staff shortage. However, in the task of Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG), LLM responses are influenced by diverse perspectives in their training dataset, leading to inaccuracies in evaluating nuanced or partially correct answers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, Grade Guard.1. To enhance the task-based specialization of the LLMs, the temperature parameter has been fine-tuned using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).2. Unlike traditional approaches, LLMs in Grade Guard compute an Indecisiveness Score (IS) along with the grade to reflect uncertainty in predicted grades.3. Introduced Confidence-Aware Loss (CAL) to generate an optimized Indecisiveness Score (IS).4. To improve reliability, self-reflection based on the optimized IS has been introduced into the framework, enabling human re-evaluation to minimize incorrect grade assignments.Our experimentation shows that the best setting of Grade Guard outperforms traditional methods by 19.16% RMSE in Upstage Solar Pro, 23.64% RMSE in Upstage Solar Mini, 4.00% RMSE in Gemini 1.5 Flash, and 10.20% RMSE in GPT 4-o Mini. Future work includes improving interpretability by generating rationales for grades to enhance accuracy. Expanding benchmark datasets and annotating them with domain-specific nuances will enhance grading accuracy. Finally, analyzing feedback to enhance confidence in predicted grades, reduce biases, optimize grading criteria, and personalize learning while supporting multilingual grading systems will make the solution more accurate, adaptable, fair, and inclusive.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. As we progress toward an agentic world where LLM-based agents autonomously handle specialized tasks, it becomes crucial for these models to adapt to new tasks without forgetting previously learned information - a challenge known as catastrophic forgetting. This study evaluates the continual fine-tuning of various open-source LLMs with different parameter sizes (specifically models under 10 billion parameters) on key NLU tasks from the GLUE benchmark, including SST-2, MRPC, CoLA, and MNLI. By employing prompt engineering and task-specific adjustments, we assess and compare the models' abilities to retain prior knowledge while learning new tasks. Our results indicate that models such as Phi-3.5-mini exhibit minimal forgetting while maintaining strong learning capabilities, making them well-suited for continual learning environments. Additionally, models like Orca-2-7b and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate impressive learning abilities and overall performance after fine-tuning. This work contributes to understanding catastrophic forgetting in LLMs and highlights prompting engineering to optimize model performance for continual learning scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cultural Intelligence (CQ) refers to the ability to understand unfamiliar cultural contexts-a crucial skill for large language models (LLMs) to effectively engage with globally diverse users. While existing research often focuses on explicitly stated cultural norms, such approaches fail to capture the subtle, implicit values that underlie real-world conversations. To address this gap, we introduce CQ-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' capability to infer implicit cultural values from natural conversational contexts. We generate a multi-character conversation-based stories dataset using values from the World Value Survey and GlobalOpinions datasets, with topics including ethical, religious, social, and political. Our dataset construction pipeline includes rigorous validation procedures-incorporation, consistency, and implicitness checks-using GPT-4o, with 98.2% human-model agreement in the final validation. Our benchmark consists of three tasks of increasing complexity: attitude detection, value selection, and value extraction. We find that while o1 and Deepseek-R1 models reach human-level performance in value selection (0.809 and 0.814), they still fall short in nuanced attitude detection, with F1 scores of 0.622 and 0.635, respectively. In the value extraction task, GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini score 0.602 and 0.598, highlighting the difficulty of open-ended cultural reasoning. Notably, fine-tuning smaller models (e.g., LLaMA-3.2-3B) on only 500 culturally rich examples improves performance by over 10%, even outperforming stronger baselines (o3-mini) in some cases. Using CQ-Bench, we provide insights into the current challenges in LLMs' CQ research and suggest practical pathways for enhancing LLMs' cross-cultural reasoning abilities.

  The reproduction of state-of-the-art multimodal LLM pre-training faces barriers at every stage of the pipeline, including high-quality data filtering, multimodal data mixture strategies, sequence packing techniques, and training frameworks. We introduce Open-Qwen2VL, a fully open-source 2B-parameter Multimodal Large Language Model pre-trained efficiently on 29M image-text pairs using only 220 A100-40G GPU hours. Our approach employs low-to-high dynamic image resolution and multimodal sequence packing to significantly enhance pre-training efficiency. The training dataset was carefully curated using both MLLM-based filtering techniques (e.g., MLM-Filter) and conventional CLIP-based filtering methods, substantially improving data quality and training efficiency. The Open-Qwen2VL pre-training is conducted on academic level 8xA100-40G GPUs at UCSB on 5B packed multimodal tokens, which is 0.36% of 1.4T multimodal pre-training tokens of Qwen2-VL. The final instruction-tuned Open-Qwen2VL outperforms partially-open state-of-the-art MLLM Qwen2-VL-2B on various multimodal benchmarks of MMBench, SEEDBench, MMstar, and MathVista, indicating the remarkable training efficiency of Open-Qwen2VL. We open-source all aspects of our work, including compute-efficient and data-efficient training details, data filtering methods, sequence packing scripts, pre-training data in WebDataset format, FSDP-based training codebase, and both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints. We redefine "fully open" for multimodal LLMs as the complete release of: 1) the training codebase, 2) detailed data filtering techniques, and 3) all pre-training and supervised fine-tuning data used to develop the model.

  Recent progress in o1-like models has significantly enhanced the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), empowering them to tackle increasingly complex tasks through reflection capabilities, such as making assumptions, backtracking, and self-refinement. However, effectively evaluating such reflection capabilities remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce LR$^2$Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the Long-chain Reflective Reasoning capabilities of LLMs. LR$^2$Bench comprises 850 samples across six Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) where reflective reasoning is crucial for deriving solutions that meet all given constraints. Each type of task focuses on distinct constraint patterns, such as knowledge-based, logical, and spatial constraints, providing a comprehensive evaluation of diverse problem-solving scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluation on both conventional models and o1-like models. Our experimental results reveal that even the most advanced reasoning-specific models, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1-preview, struggle with tasks in LR$^2$Bench, achieving an average Exact Match score of only 20.0% and 23.6%, respectively. These findings underscore the significant room for improvement in the reflective reasoning capabilities of current LLMs. The leaderboard of our benchmark is available atthis https URL

  The breakthrough of generative large language models (LLMs) that can solve different tasks through chat interaction has led to a significant increase in the use of general benchmarks to assess the quality or performance of these models beyond individual applications. There is also a need for better methods to evaluate and also to compare models due to the ever increasing number of new models published. However, most of the established benchmarks revolve around the English language. This paper analyses the benefits and limitations of current evaluation datasets, focusing on multilingual European benchmarks. We analyse seven multilingual benchmarks and identify four major challenges. Furthermore, we discuss potential solutions to enhance translation quality and mitigate cultural biases, including human-in-the-loop verification and iterative translation ranking. Our analysis highlights the need for culturally aware and rigorously validated benchmarks to assess the reasoning and question-answering capabilities of multilingual LLMs accurately.

  In this work, we propose a Multi-LLM summarization framework, and investigate two different multi-LLM strategies including centralized and decentralized. Our multi-LLM summarization framework has two fundamentally important steps at each round of conversation: generation and evaluation. These steps are different depending on whether our multi-LLM decentralized summarization is used or centralized. In both our multi-LLM decentralized and centralized strategies, we have k different LLMs that generate diverse summaries of the text. However, during evaluation, our multi-LLM centralized summarization approach leverages a single LLM to evaluate the summaries and select the best one whereas k LLMs are used for decentralized multi-LLM summarization. Overall, we find that our multi-LLM summarization approaches significantly outperform the baselines that leverage only a single LLM by up to 3x. These results indicate the effectiveness of multi-LLM approaches for summarization.

  This paper leverages large-language models (LLMs) to experimentally determine optimal strategies for scaling up social media content annotation for stance detection on HPV vaccine-related tweets. We examine both conventional fine-tuning and emergent in-context learning methods, systematically varying strategies of prompt engineering across widely used LLMs and their variants (e.g., GPT4, Mistral, and Llama3, etc.). Specifically, we varied prompt template design, shot sampling methods, and shot quantity to detect stance on HPV vaccination. Our findings reveal that 1) in general, in-context learning outperforms fine-tuning in stance detection for HPV vaccine social media content; 2) increasing shot quantity does not necessarily enhance performance across models; and 3) different LLMs and their variants present differing sensitivity to in-context learning conditions. We uncovered that the optimal in-context learning configuration for stance detection on HPV vaccine tweets involves six stratified shots paired with detailed contextual prompts. This study highlights the potential and provides an applicable approach for applying LLMs to research on social media stance and skepticism detection.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency losslessly, but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy SD more effectively for high throughput inference. We leverage draft model with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck, which scales with both sequence length and batch size. Additionally, we propose a theoretical model to select the optimal drafting strategy for maximum speedup. Our work highlights the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2.51x speedup for Llama3.1-8B when serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on various types of hardware and tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to learn and perform complex tasks through in-context learning (ICL). However, a comprehensive understanding of its internal mechanisms is still lacking. This paper explores the role of induction heads in a few-shot ICL setting. We analyse two state-of-the-art models, Llama-3-8B and InternLM2-20B on abstract pattern recognition and NLP tasks. Our results show that even a minimal ablation of induction heads leads to ICL performance decreases of up to ~32% for abstract pattern recognition tasks, bringing the performance close to random. For NLP tasks, this ablation substantially decreases the model's ability to benefit from examples, bringing few-shot ICL performance close to that of zero-shot prompts. We further use attention knockout to disable specific induction patterns, and present fine-grained evidence for the role that the induction mechanism plays in ICL.

  The path to interpreting a language model often proceeds via analysis of circuits -- sparse computational subgraphs of the model that capture specific aspects of its behavior. Recent work has automated the task of discovering circuits. Yet, these methods have practical limitations, as they rely either on inefficient search algorithms or inaccurate approximations. In this paper, we frame automated circuit discovery as an optimization problem and propose *Edge Pruning* as an effective and scalable solution. Edge Pruning leverages gradient-based pruning techniques, but instead of removing neurons or components, it prunes the \emph{edges} between components. Our method finds circuits in GPT-2 that use less than half the number of edges compared to circuits found by previous methods while being equally faithful to the full model predictions on standard circuit-finding tasks. Edge Pruning is efficient even with as many as 100K examples, outperforming previous methods in speed and producing substantially better circuits. It also perfectly recovers the ground-truth circuits in two models compiled with Tracr. Thanks to its efficiency, we scale Edge Pruning to CodeLlama-13B, a model over 100x the scale that prior methods operate on. We use this setting for a case study comparing the mechanisms behind instruction prompting and in-context learning. We find two circuits with more than 99.96% sparsity that match the performance of the full model and reveal that the mechanisms in the two settings overlap substantially. Our case study shows that Edge Pruning is a practical and scalable tool for interpretability and sheds light on behaviors that only emerge in large models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While there has been significant development of models for Plain Language Summarization (PLS), evaluation remains a challenge. PLS lacks a dedicated assessment metric, and the suitability of text generation evaluation metrics is unclear due to the unique transformations involved (e.g., adding background explanations, removing jargon). To address these questions, our study introduces a granular meta-evaluation testbed, APPLS, designed to evaluate metrics for PLS. We identify four PLS criteria from previous work -- informativeness, simplification, coherence, and faithfulness -- and define a set of perturbations corresponding to these criteria that sensitive metrics should be able to detect. We apply these perturbations to extractive hypotheses for two PLS datasets to form our testbed. Using APPLS, we assess performance of 14 metrics, including automated scores, lexical features, and LLM prompt-based evaluations. Our analysis reveals that while some current metrics show sensitivity to specific criteria, no single method captures all four criteria simultaneously. We therefore recommend a suite of automated metrics be used to capture PLS quality along all relevant criteria. This work contributes the first meta-evaluation testbed for PLS and a comprehensive evaluation of existing metrics. APPLS and our evaluation code is available atthis https URL.

  In the quest to enable robots to coexist with humans, understanding dynamic situations and selecting appropriate actions based on common sense and affordances are essential. Conventional AI systems face challenges in applying affordance, as it represents implicit knowledge derived from common sense. However, large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities due to their ability to process extensive human knowledge. This study proposes a method for automatic affordance acquisition by leveraging LLM outputs. The process involves generating text using LLMs, reconstructing the output into a symbol network using morphological and dependency analysis, and calculating affordances based on network distances. Experiments using ``apple'' as an example demonstrated the method's ability to extract context-dependent affordances with high explainability. The results suggest that the proposed symbol network, reconstructed from LLM outputs, enables robots to interpret affordances effectively, bridging the gap between symbolized data and human-like situational understanding.

  Planning methods with high adaptability to dynamic environments are crucial for the development of autonomous and versatile robots. We propose a method for leveraging a large language model (GPT-4o) to automatically generate networks capable of adapting to dynamic environments. The proposed method collects environmental "status," representing conditions and goals, and uses them to generate agents. These agents are interconnected on the basis of specific conditions, resulting in networks that combine flexibility and generality. We conducted evaluation experiments to compare the networks automatically generated with the proposed method with manually constructed ones, confirming the comprehensiveness of the proposed method's networks and their higher generality. This research marks a significant advancement toward the development of versatile planning methods applicable to robotics, autonomous vehicles, smart systems, and other complex environments.

  Nowadays, the rapid development of mobile economy has promoted the flourishing of online marketing campaigns, whose success greatly hinges on the efficient matching between user preferences and desired marketing campaigns where a well-established Marketing-oriented Knowledge Graph (dubbed as MoKG) could serve as the critical "bridge" for preference propagation. In this paper, we seek to carefully prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) with domain-level knowledge as a better marketing-oriented knowledge miner for marketing-oriented knowledge graph construction, which is however non-trivial, suffering from several inevitable issues in real-world marketing scenarios, i.e., uncontrollable relation generation of LLMs,insufficient prompting ability of a single prompt, the unaffordable deployment cost of LLMs. To this end, we propose PAIR, a novel Progressive prompting Augmented mIning fRamework for harvesting marketing-oriented knowledge graph with LLMs. In particular, we reduce the pure relation generation to an LLM based adaptive relation filtering process through the knowledge-empowered prompting technique. Next, we steer LLMs for entity expansion with progressive prompting augmentation,followed by a reliable aggregation with comprehensive consideration of both self-consistency and semantic relatedness. In terms of online serving, we specialize in a small and white-box PAIR (i.e.,LightPAIR),which is fine-tuned with a high-quality corpus provided by a strong teacher-LLM. Extensive experiments and practical applications in audience targeting verify the effectiveness of the proposed (Light)PAIR.

  We introduce PaperBench, a benchmark evaluating the ability of AI agents to replicate state-of-the-art AI research. Agents must replicate 20 ICML 2024 Spotlight and Oral papers from scratch, including understanding paper contributions, developing a codebase, and successfully executing experiments. For objective evaluation, we develop rubrics that hierarchically decompose each replication task into smaller sub-tasks with clear grading criteria. In total, PaperBench contains 8,316 individually gradable tasks. Rubrics are co-developed with the author(s) of each ICML paper for accuracy and realism. To enable scalable evaluation, we also develop an LLM-based judge to automatically grade replication attempts against rubrics, and assess our judge's performance by creating a separate benchmark for judges. We evaluate several frontier models on PaperBench, finding that the best-performing tested agent, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New) with open-source scaffolding, achieves an average replication score of 21.0\%. Finally, we recruit top ML PhDs to attempt a subset of PaperBench, finding that models do not yet outperform the human baseline.

  As digitalization and cloud technologies evolve, the web is becoming increasingly important in the modern society. Autonomous web agents based on large language models (LLMs) hold a great potential in work automation. It is therefore important to accurately measure and monitor the progression of their capabilities. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the current state of web agents. Our results depict a very different picture of the competency of current agents, suggesting over-optimism in previously reported results. This gap can be attributed to shortcomings in existing benchmarks. We introduce Online-Mind2Web, an online evaluation benchmark consisting of 300 diverse and realistic tasks spanning 136 websites. It enables us to evaluate web agents under a setting that approximates how real users use these agents. To facilitate more scalable evaluation and development, we also develop a novel LLM-as-a-Judge automatic evaluation method and show that it can achieve around 85% agreement with human judgment, substantially higher than existing methods. Finally, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of current web agents, highlighting both their strengths and limitations to inspire future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often benefit from verbalized reasoning at inference time, but it remains unclear which aspects of task difficulty these extra reasoning tokens address. To investigate this question, we formalize a framework using deterministic finite automata (DFAs). DFAs offer a formalism through which we can characterize task complexity through measurable properties such as run length (number of reasoning steps required) and state-space size (decision complexity). We first show that across different tasks and models of different sizes and training paradigms, there exists an optimal amount of reasoning tokens such that the probability of producing a correct solution is maximized. We then investigate which properties of complexity govern this critical length: we find that task instances with longer corresponding underlying DFA runs (i.e. demand greater latent state-tracking requirements) correlate with longer reasoning lengths, but, surprisingly, that DFA size (i.e. state-space complexity) does not. We then demonstrate an implication of these findings: being able to predict the optimal number of reasoning tokens for new problems and filtering out non-optimal length answers results in consistent accuracy improvements.

  Systematic generalization refers to the capacity to understand and generate novel combinations from known components. Despite recent progress by large language models (LLMs) across various domains, these models often fail to extend their knowledge to novel compositional scenarios, revealing notable limitations in systematic generalization. There has been an ongoing debate about whether neural networks possess the capacity for systematic generalization, with recent studies suggesting that meta-learning approaches designed for compositionality can significantly enhance this ability. However, these insights have largely been confined to linguistic problems, leaving their applicability to other tasks an open question. In this study, we extend the approach of meta-learning for compositionality to the domain of abstract spatial reasoning. To this end, we introduce $\textit{SYGAR}$-a dataset designed to evaluate the capacity of models to systematically generalize from known geometric transformations (e.g., translation, rotation) of two-dimensional objects to novel combinations of these transformations (e.g., translation+rotation). Our results show that a transformer-based encoder-decoder model, trained via meta-learning for compositionality, can systematically generalize to previously unseen transformation compositions, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs, including o3-mini, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, which fail to exhibit similar systematic behavior. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of meta-learning in promoting systematicity beyond linguistic tasks, suggesting a promising direction toward more robust and generalizable models.

  _Si Chen, Xiao Yu, Ninareh Mehrabi, Rahul Gupta, Zhou Yu, Ruoxi Jia_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The exploitation of large language models (LLMs) for malicious purposes poses significant security risks as these models become more powerful and widespread. While most existing red-teaming frameworks focus on single-turn attacks, real-world adversaries typically operate in multi-turn scenarios, iteratively probing for vulnerabilities and adapting their prompts based on threat model responses. In this paper, we propose \AlgName, a novel multi-turn red-teaming agent that emulates sophisticated human attackers through complementary learning dimensions: global tactic-wise learning that accumulates knowledge over time and generalizes to new attack goals, and local prompt-wise learning that refines implementations for specific goals when initial attempts fail. Unlike previous multi-turn approaches that rely on fixed strategy sets, \AlgName enables the agent to identify new jailbreak tactics, develop a goal-based tactic selection framework, and refine prompt formulations for selected tactics. Empirical evaluations on JailbreakBench demonstrate our framework's superior performance, achieving over 90\% attack success rates against GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama-3.1-70B within 5 conversation turns, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of dynamic learning in identifying and exploiting model vulnerabilities in realistic multi-turn scenarios.

  Embodied agents operating in real-world environments must interpret ambiguous and under-specified human instructions. A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent must fetch a specific object instance given an ambiguous instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines, including GPT-4o, and supervised fine-tuned MLLMs, on our task. Our results demonstrate that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin ($19.1$-$40.3\%$), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.

  This paper presents a simple, effective, and cost-efficient strategy to improve LLM performance by scaling test-time compute. Our strategy builds upon the repeated-sampling-then-voting framework, with a novel twist: incorporating multiple models, even weaker ones, to leverage their complementary strengths that potentially arise from diverse training data and paradigms. By using consistency as a signal, our strategy dynamically switches between models. Theoretical analysis highlights the efficiency and performance advantages of our strategy. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our strategy not only outperforms self-consistency and state-of-the-art multi-agent debate approaches, but also significantly reduces inference costs. Additionally, ModelSwitch requires only a few comparable LLMs to achieve optimal performance and can be extended with verification methods, demonstrating the potential of leveraging multiple LLMs in the generation-verification paradigm.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose a novel factored agent architecture designed to overcome the limitations of traditional single-agent systems in agentic AI. Our approach decomposes the agent into two specialized components: (1) a large language model (LLM) that serves as a high level planner and in-context learner, which may use dynamically available information in user prompts, (2) a smaller language model which acts as a memorizer of tool format and output. This decoupling addresses prevalent issues in monolithic designs, including malformed, missing, and hallucinated API fields, as well as suboptimal planning in dynamic environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our factored architecture significantly improves planning accuracy and error resilience, while elucidating the inherent trade-off between in-context learning and static memorization. These findings suggest that a factored approach is a promising pathway for developing more robust and adaptable agentic AI systems.

  Large Language Models excel in reasoning yet often rely on Chain-of-Thought prompts, limiting performance on tasks demanding more nuanced topological structures. We present SOLAR (Scalable Optimization of Large-scale Architecture for Reasoning), a framework that dynamically optimizes Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and Graph-of-Thought (GoT) topologies to boost accuracy and efficiency. Our Topological-Annotation-Generation (TAG) system automates dataset creation, annotation, and difficulty segmentation, leading to stronger post training and test-time performance. We also propose Topological-Scaling, a curriculum-learning-based approach that adaptively combines post training and inference scaling to each task. On MATH and GSM8K, SOLAR delivers notable gains: +5% accuracy with Topological Tuning, +9% with Topological Rewarding, and +10.02% with Hybrid Scaling, while reducing response length by over 5%, lowering inference latency. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce a multi-task Topological Reward Model (M-TRM) that selects both the optimal reasoning topology and final answer in a single pass, eliminating multiple single-task TRMs. Remarkably, M-TRM also surpasses all single-task TRMs, improving accuracy by +10% and rank correlation by +9%. Overall, SOLAR establishes a new benchmark for scalable, high-precision LLM reasoning and introduces a fully automated, dynamic topology competition mechanism.

  Despite prior safety alignment efforts, mainstream LLMs can still generate harmful and unethical content when subjected to jailbreaking attacks. Existing jailbreaking methods fall into two main categories: template-based and optimization-based methods. The former requires significant manual effort and domain knowledge, while the latter, exemplified by Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), which seeks to maximize the likelihood of harmful LLM outputs through token-level optimization, also encounters several limitations: requiring white-box access, necessitating pre-constructed affirmative phrase, and suffering from low efficiency. In this paper, we present ECLIPSE, a novel and efficient black-box jailbreaking method utilizing optimizable suffixes. Drawing inspiration from LLMs' powerful generation and optimization capabilities, we employ task prompts to translate jailbreaking goals into natural language instructions. This guides the LLM to generate adversarial suffixes for malicious queries. In particular, a harmfulness scorer provides continuous feedback, enabling LLM self-reflection and iterative optimization to autonomously and efficiently produce effective suffixes. Experimental results demonstrate that ECLIPSE achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 0.92 across three open-source LLMs and GPT-3.5-Turbo, significantly surpassing GCG in 2.4 times. Moreover, ECLIPSE is on par with template-based methods in ASR while offering superior attack efficiency, reducing the average attack overhead by 83%.

  Spreadsheets are characterized by their extensive two-dimensional grids, flexible layouts, and varied formatting options, which pose significant challenges for large language models (LLMs). In response, we introduce SpreadsheetLLM, pioneering an efficient encoding method designed to unleash and optimize LLMs' powerful understanding and reasoning capability on spreadsheets. Initially, we propose a vanilla serialization approach that incorporates cell addresses, values, and formats. However, this approach was limited by LLMs' token constraints, making it impractical for most applications. To tackle this challenge, we develop SheetCompressor, an innovative encoding framework that compresses spreadsheets effectively for LLMs. It comprises three modules: structural-anchor-based compression, inverse index translation, and data-format-aware aggregation. It significantly improves performance in the spreadsheet table detection task, outperforming the vanilla approach by 25.6% in GPT4's in-context learning setting. Moreover, fine-tuned LLM with SheetCompressor has an average compression ratio of 25 times, and achieves a state-of-the-art 78.9% F1 score, surpassing the best existing models by 12.3%. Finally, we propose Chain of Spreadsheet for downstream tasks of spreadsheet understanding and validate it in a new and demanding spreadsheet QA task. We methodically leverage the inherent layout and structure of spreadsheets, demonstrating that SpreadsheetLLM is highly effective across a variety of spreadsheet tasks.
