- **[A Multi-Level Similarity Approach for Single-View Object Grasping: Matching, Planning, and Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11938)**  `arXiv:2507.11938`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Grasping unknown objects from a single view has remained a challenging topic in robotics due to the uncertainty of partial observation. Recent advances in large-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion. However, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in performance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental changes. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping, we abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective: similarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the grasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly achieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key steps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform similarity matching with an existing database containing various object models, identifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate models with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the unknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local fine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy observation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that integrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive evaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor, the C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between partial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database models. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce the semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration approach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under single-view conditions.

  Robot vision has greatly benefited from advancements in multimodal fusion techniques and vision-language models (VLMs). We systematically review the applications of multimodal fusion in key robotic vision tasks, including semantic scene understanding, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), 3D object detection, navigation and localization, and robot manipulation. We compare VLMs based on large language models (LLMs) with traditional multimodal fusion methods, analyzing their advantages, limitations, and synergies. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of commonly used datasets, evaluating their applicability and challenges in real-world robotic scenarios. Furthermore, we identify critical research challenges such as cross-modal alignment, efficient fusion strategies, real-time deployment, and domain adaptation, and propose future research directions, including self-supervised learning for robust multimodal representations, transformer-based fusion architectures, and scalable multimodal frameworks. Through a comprehensive review, comparative analysis, and forward-looking discussion, we provide a valuable reference for advancing multimodal perception and interaction in robotic vision.

- **[Enhancing Trust in Autonomous Agents: An Architecture for Accountability and Explainability through Blockchain and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09567)**  `arXiv:2403.09567`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Laura Fern√°ndez-Becerra, Miguel √Ångel Gonz√°lez-Santamarta, √Ångel Manuel Guerrero-Higueras, Francisco Javier Rodr√≠guez-Lera, Vicente Matell√°n Olivera_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The deployment of autonomous agents in environments involving human interaction has increasingly raised security concerns. Consequently, understanding the circumstances behind an event becomes critical, requiring the development of capabilities to justify their behaviors to non-expert users. Such explanations are essential in enhancing trustworthiness and safety, acting as a preventive measure against failures, errors, and misunderstandings. Additionally, they contribute to improving communication, bridging the gap between the agent and the user, thereby improving the effectiveness of their interactions. This work presents an accountability and explainability architecture implemented for ROS-based mobile robots. The proposed solution consists of two main components. Firstly, a black box-like element to provide accountability, featuring anti-tampering properties achieved through blockchain technology. Secondly, a component in charge of generating natural language explanations by harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) over the data contained within the previously mentioned black box. The study evaluates the performance of our solution in three different scenarios, each involving autonomous agent navigation functionalities. This evaluation includes a thorough examination of accountability and explainability metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in using accountable data from robot actions to obtain coherent, accurate and understandable explanations, even when facing challenges inherent in the use of autonomous agents in real-world scenarios.

- **[Assessing the Value of Visual Input: A Benchmark of Multimodal Large Language Models for Robotic Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12391)**  `arXiv:2507.12391`  `cs.RO`  
  _Jacinto Colan, Ana Davila, Yasuhisa Hasegawa_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for enhancing robotic path planning. This paper assesses visual input's utility for multimodal LLMs in such tasks via a comprehensive benchmark. We evaluated 15 multimodal LLMs on generating valid and optimal paths in 2D grid environments, simulating simplified robotic planning, comparing text-only versus text-plus-visual inputs across varying model sizes and grid complexities. Our results indicate moderate success rates on simpler small grids, where visual input or few-shot text prompting offered some benefits. However, performance significantly degraded on larger grids, highlighting a scalability challenge. While larger models generally achieved higher average success, the visual modality was not universally dominant over well-structured text for these multimodal systems, and successful paths on simpler grids were generally of high quality. These results indicate current limitations in robust spatial reasoning, constraint adherence, and scalable multimodal integration, identifying areas for future LLM development in robotic path planning.

  _Luca Garello, Francesca Cocchella, Alessandra Sciutti, Manuel Catalano, Francesco Rea_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous robots are increasingly being tested into public spaces to enhance user experiences, particularly in cultural and educational settings. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the autonomous museum guide robot Alter-Ego equipped with advanced navigation and interactive capabilities. The robot leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide real-time, context aware question-and-answer (Q&A) interactions, allowing visitors to engage in conversations about exhibits. It also employs robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques, enabling seamless navigation through museum spaces and route adaptation based on user requests. The system was tested in a real museum environment with 34 participants, combining qualitative analysis of visitor-robot conversations and quantitative analysis of pre and post interaction surveys. Results showed that the robot was generally well-received and contributed to an engaging museum experience, despite some limitations in comprehension and responsiveness. This study sheds light on HRI in cultural spaces, highlighting not only the potential of AI-driven robotics to support accessibility and knowledge acquisition, but also the current limitations and challenges of deploying such technologies in complex, real-world environments.

- **[Robot Drummer: Learning Rhythmic Skills for Humanoid Drumming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11498)**  `arXiv:2507.11498`  `cs.RO`  
  _Asad Ali Shahid, Francesco Braghin, Loris Roveda_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humanoid robots have seen remarkable advances in dexterity, balance, and locomotion, yet their role in expressive domains such as music performance remains largely unexplored. Musical tasks, like drumming, present unique challenges, including split-second timing, rapid contacts, and multi-limb coordination over performances lasting minutes. In this paper, we introduce Robot Drummer, a humanoid capable of expressive, high-precision drumming across a diverse repertoire of songs. We formulate humanoid drumming as sequential fulfillment of timed contacts and transform drum scores into a Rhythmic Contact Chain. To handle the long-horizon nature of musical performance, we decompose each piece into fixed-length segments and train a single policy across all segments in parallel using reinforcement learning. Through extensive experiments on over thirty popular rock, metal, and jazz tracks, our results demonstrate that Robot Drummer consistently achieves high F1 scores. The learned behaviors exhibit emergent human-like drumming strategies, such as cross-arm strikes, and adaptive stick assignments, demonstrating the potential of reinforcement learning to bring humanoid robots into the domain of creative musical performance.

- **[STEP Planner: Constructing cross-hierarchical subgoal tree as an embodied long-horizon task planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21030)**  `arXiv:2506.21030`  `cs.RO`  
  _Tianxing Zhou, Zhirui Wang, Haojia Ao, Guangyan Chen, Boyang Xing, Jingwen Cheng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to perform reliable long-horizon task planning is crucial for deploying robots in real-world environments. However, directly employing Large Language Models (LLMs) as action sequence generators often results in low success rates due to their limited reasoning ability for long-horizon embodied tasks. In the STEP framework, we construct a subgoal tree through a pair of closed-loop models: a subgoal decomposition model and a leaf node termination model. Within this framework, we develop a hierarchical tree structure that spans from coarse to fine resolutions. The subgoal decomposition model leverages a foundation LLM to break down complex goals into manageable subgoals, thereby spanning the subgoal tree. The leaf node termination model provides real-time feedback based on environmental states, determining when to terminate the tree spanning and ensuring each leaf node can be directly converted into a primitive action. Experiments conducted in both the VirtualHome WAH-NL benchmark and on real robots demonstrate that STEP achieves long-horizon embodied task completion with success rates up to 34% (WAH-NL) and 25% (real robot) outperforming SOTA methods.

- **[BRIDGE: Bootstrapping Text to Control Time-Series Generation via Multi-Agent Iterative Optimization and Diffusion Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02445)**  `arXiv:2503.02445`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL` `cs.MA`  
  _Hao Li, Yu-Hao Huang, Chang Xu, Viktor Schlegel, Renhe Jiang, Riza Batista-Navarro, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time-series Generation (TSG) is a prominent research area with broad applications in simulations, data augmentation, and counterfactual analysis. While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by up to 12% on MSE and 6% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.

- **[PRISM: Distributed Inference for Foundation Models at Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12145)**  `arXiv:2507.12145`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models (FMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, from image classification to natural langurage processing, but pose significant challenges for deployment at edge. This has sparked growing interest in developing practical and efficient strategies for bringing foundation models to edge environments. In this work, we propose PRISM, a communication-efficient and compute-aware strategy for distributed Transformer inference on edge devices. Our method leverages a Segment Means representation to approximate intermediate output features, drastically reducing inter-device communication. Additionally, we restructure the self-attention mechanism to eliminate redundant computations caused by per-device Key/Value calculation in position-wise partitioning and design a partition-aware causal masking scheme tailored for autoregressive models. We evaluate PRISM on ViT, BERT, and GPT-2 across diverse datasets, namely CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, GLUE, and CBT. Our results demonstrate substantial reductions in communication overhead (up to 99.2% for BERT at compression rate CR = 128) and per-device computation (51.24% for BERT at the same setting), with only minor accuracy degradation. This method offers a scalable and practical solution for deploying foundation models in distributed resource-constrained environments.

- **[FADE: Why Bad Descriptions Happen to Good Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16994)**  `arXiv:2502.16994`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have highlighted the potential of automating interpretability pipelines in analyzing the latent representations within LLMs. While this may enhance our understanding of internal mechanisms, the field lacks standardized evaluation methods for assessing the validity of discovered features. We attempt to bridge this gap by introducing FADE: Feature Alignment to Description Evaluation, a scalable model-agnostic framework for automatically evaluating feature-to-description alignment. FADE evaluates alignment across four key metrics - Clarity, Responsiveness, Purity, and Faithfulness - and systematically quantifies the causes of the misalignment between features and their descriptions. We apply FADE to analyze existing open-source feature descriptions and assess key components of automated interpretability pipelines, aiming to enhance the quality of descriptions. Our findings highlight fundamental challenges in generating feature descriptions, particularly for SAEs compared to MLP neurons, providing insights into the limitations and future directions of automated interpretability. We release FADE as an open-source package at:this https URL

- **[Learning to Reason at the Frontier of Learnability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12272)**  `arXiv:2502.12272`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Thomas Foster, Jakob Foerster_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning is now widely adopted as the final stage of large language model training, especially for reasoning-style tasks such as maths problems. Typically, models attempt each question many times during a single training step and attempt to learn from their successes and failures. However, we demonstrate that throughout training with two popular algorithms (PPO and VinePPO) on two widely used datasets, many questions are either solved by all attempts - meaning they are already learned - or by none - providing no meaningful training signal. To address this, we adapt a method from the reinforcement learning literature - sampling for learnability - and apply it to the reinforcement learning stage of LLM training. Our curriculum prioritises questions with high variance of success, i.e. those where the agent sometimes succeeds, but not always. Our findings demonstrate that this curriculum consistently boosts training performance across multiple algorithms and datasets, paving the way for more efficient and effective reinforcement learning with LLMs.

- **[Can LLMs Find Fraudsters? Multi-level LLM Enhanced Graph Fraud Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11997)**  `arXiv:2507.11997`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Tairan Huang, Yili Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within multimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM \textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks. However, prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training instability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled learning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning framework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks, effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning baselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning models.

- **[Predictable Scale: Part II, Farseer: A Refined Scaling Law in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10972)**  `arXiv:2506.10972`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Houyi Li, Wenzhen Zheng, Qiufeng Wang, Zhenyu Ding, Haoying Wang, Zili Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions, demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings, enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs atthis https URLto foster further research.

- **[Scaling laws for activation steering with Llama 2 models and refusal mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11771)**  `arXiv:2507.11771`  `cs.LG`  
  _Sheikh Abdur Raheem Ali, Justin Xu, Ivory Yang, Jasmine Xinze Li, Ayse Arslan, Clark Benham_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) evolve in complexity and capability, the efficacy of less widely deployed alignment techniques are uncertain. Building on previous work on activation steering and contrastive activation addition (CAA), this paper explores the effectiveness of CAA with model scale using the family of Llama 2 models (7B, 13B, and 70B). CAA works by finding desirable 'directions' in the model's residual stream vector space using contrastive pairs (for example, hate to love) and adding this direction to the residual stream during the forward pass. It directly manipulates the residual stream and aims to extract features from language models to better control their outputs. Using answer matching questions centered around the refusal behavior, we found that 1) CAA is most effective when applied at early-mid layers. 2) The effectiveness of CAA diminishes with model size. 3) Negative steering has more pronounced effects than positive steering across all model sizes.

- **[Composing Linear Layers from Irreducibles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11688)**  `arXiv:2507.11688`  `cs.LG`  
  _Travis Pence, Daisuke Yamada, Vikas Singh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contemporary large models often exhibit behaviors suggesting the presence of low-level primitives that compose into modules with richer functionality, but these fundamental building blocks remain poorly understood. We investigate this compositional structure in linear layers by asking: can we identify/synthesize linear transformations from a minimal set of geometric primitives? Using Clifford algebra, we show that linear layers can be expressed as compositions of bivectors -- geometric objects encoding oriented planes -- and introduce a differentiable algorithm that decomposes them into products of rotors. This construction uses only O(log^2 d) parameters, versus O(d^2) required by dense matrices. Applied to the key, query, and value projections in LLM attention layers, our rotor-based layers match the performance of strong baselines such as block-Hadamard and low-rank approximations. Our findings provide an algebraic perspective on how these geometric primitives can compose into higher-level functions within deep models.

  _Rynaa Grover, Jayant Sravan Tamarapalli, Sahiti Yerramilli, Nilay Pande_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.

- **[Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11558)**  `arXiv:2507.11558`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Changlu Chen, Yanbin Liu, Chaoxi Niu, Ling Chen, Tianqing Zhu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these, ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones (e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.

- **[Visual Position Prompt for MLLM based Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15426)**  `arXiv:2503.15426`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Wei Tang, Yanpeng Sun, Qinying Gu, Zechao Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at various image-related tasks, they encounter challenges in precisely aligning coordinates with spatial information within images, particularly in position-aware tasks such as visual grounding. This limitation arises from two key factors. First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult to associate textual descriptions with precise image locations. Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address these issues, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM enhanced with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms: the global VPP overlays a learnable, axis-like tensor onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues, while the local VPP incorporates position-aware queries to support fine-grainedthis http URLeffectively train our model with spatial guidance, we further introduce VPP-SFT, a curated dataset of 0.6M high-quality visual grounding samples. Designed in a compact format, it enables efficient training and is significantly smaller than datasets used by other MLLMs (e.g., ~21M samples in MiniGPT-v2), yet still provides a strong performance boost. The resulting model, VPP-LLaVA, not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard visual grounding benchmarks but also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to challenging unseen datasets. The code and dataset are available atthis https URL.

- **[Mitigating Object Hallucinations via Sentence-Level Early Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12455)**  `arXiv:2507.12455`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shangpin Peng, Senqiao Yang, Li Jiang, Zhuotao Tian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized cross-modal understanding but continue to struggle with hallucinations - fabricated content contradicting visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods either incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight: hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose **SENTINEL** (**S**entence-level **E**arly i**N**tervention **T**hrough **IN**-domain pr**E**ference **L**earning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use context-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to build context-aware preference data iteratively. Finally, we train models using a context-aware preference loss (C-DPO) that emphasizes discriminative learning at the sentence level where hallucinations initially manifest. Experimental results show that SENTINEL can reduce hallucinations by over 90\% compared to the original model and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on both hallucination benchmarks and general capabilities benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority and generalization ability. The models, datasets, and code are available atthis https URL.

- **[MGFFD-VLM: Multi-Granularity Prompt Learning for Face Forgery Detection with VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12232)**  `arXiv:2507.12232`  `cs.CV`  
  _Tao Chen, Jingyi Zhang, Decheng Liu, Chunlei Peng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies have utilized visual large language models (VLMs) to answer not only "Is this face a forgery?" but also "Why is the face a forgery?" These studies introduced forgery-related attributes, such as forgery location and type, to construct deepfake VQA datasets and train VLMs, achieving high accuracy while providing human-understandable explanatory text descriptions. However, these methods still have limitations. For example, they do not fully leverage face quality-related attributes, which are often abnormal in forged faces, and they lack effective training strategies for forgery-aware VLMs. In this paper, we extend the VQA dataset to create DD-VQA+, which features a richer set of attributes and a more diverse range of samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel forgery detection framework, MGFFD-VLM, which integrates an Attribute-Driven Hybrid LoRA Strategy to enhance the capabilities of Visual Large Language Models (VLMs). Additionally, our framework incorporates Multi-Granularity Prompt Learning and a Forgery-Aware Training Strategy. By transforming classification and forgery segmentation results into prompts, our method not only improves forgery classification but also enhances interpretability. To further boost detection performance, we design multiple forgery-related auxiliary losses. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing methods in both text-based forgery judgment and analysis, achieving superior accuracy.

OVIGo-3DHSG represents an extensive indoor environment over a Hierarchical Scene Graph derived from sequences of RGB-D frames utilizing a set of open-vocabulary foundation models and sensor data processing. The hierarchical representation explicitly models spatial relations across floors, rooms, locations, and objects. To effectively address complex queries involving spatial reference to other objects, we integrate the hierarchical scene graph with a Large Language Model for multistep reasoning. This integration leverages inter-layer (e.g., room-to-object) and intra-layer (e.g., object-to-object) connections, enhancing spatial contextual understanding. We investigate the semantic and geometry accuracy of hierarchical representation on Habitat Matterport 3D Semantic multi-floor scenes. Our approach demonstrates efficient scene comprehension and robust object grounding compared to existing methods. Overall OVIGo-3DHSG demonstrates strong potential for applications requiring spatial reasoning and understanding of indoor environments. Related materials can be found atthis https URL.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly used for content moderation, yet their robustness in short-form video contexts remains underexplored. Current safety evaluations often rely on unimodal attacks, failing to address combined attack vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating the tri-modal safety of MLLMs. First, we present the Short-Video Multimodal Adversarial (SVMA) dataset, comprising diverse short-form videos with human-guided synthetic adversarial attacks. Second, we propose ChimeraBreak, a novel tri-modal attack strategy that simultaneously challenges visual, auditory, and semantic reasoning pathways. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant vulnerabilities with high Attack Success Rates (ASR). Our findings uncover distinct failure modes, showing model biases toward misclassifying benign or policy-violating content. We assess results using LLM-as-a-judge, demonstrating attack reasoning efficacy. Our dataset and findings provide crucial insights for developing more robust and safe MLLMs.

  Mental visualization, the ability to construct and manipulate visual representations internally, is a core component of human cognition and plays a vital role in tasks involving reasoning, prediction, and abstraction. Despite the rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current benchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insight into the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns to support problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each task is procedurally generated and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns, robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.

  With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI) technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment (SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  Visual grounding in text-rich document images is a critical yet underexplored challenge for Document Intelligence and Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems. We present DRISHTIKON, a multi-granular and multi-block visual grounding framework designed to enhance interpretability and trust in VQA for complex, multilingual documents. Our approach integrates multilingual OCR, large language models, and a novel region matching algorithm to localize answer spans at the block, line, word, and point levels. We introduce the Multi-Granular Visual Grounding (MGVG) benchmark, a curated test set of diverse circular notifications from various sectors, each manually annotated with fine-grained, human-verified labels across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level granularity providing the best balance between precision and recall. Ablation studies further highlight the benefits of multi-block and multi-line reasoning. Comparative evaluations reveal that leading vision-language models struggle with precise localization, underscoring the effectiveness of our structured, alignment-based approach. Our findings pave the way for more robust and interpretable document understanding systems in real-world, text-centric scenarios with multi-granular grounding support. Code and dataset are made available for future research.

  Editing images using natural language instructions has become a natural and expressive way to modify visual content; yet, evaluating the performance of such models remains challenging. Existing evaluation approaches often rely on image-text similarity metrics like CLIP, which lack precision. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark designed to evaluate text-guided image editing models in a more grounded manner, along two critical dimensions: (i) functional correctness, assessed via automatically generated multiple-choice questions that verify whether the intended change was successfully applied; and (ii) image content preservation, which ensures that non-targeted regions of the image remain visually consistent using an object-aware masking technique and preservation scoring. The benchmark includes over 1000 high-quality editing examples across 20 diverse content categories, each annotated with detailed editing instructions, evaluation questions, and spatial object masks. We conduct a large-scale study comparing GPT-Image-1, the latest flagship in the text-guided image editing space, against several state-of-the-art editing models, and validate our automatic metrics against human ratings. Results show that GPT-Image-1 leads in instruction-following accuracy, but often over-modifies irrelevant image regions, highlighting a key trade-off in the current model behavior. GIE-Bench provides a scalable, reproducible framework for advancing more accurate evaluation of text-guided image editing.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The remarkable performance of large multimodal models (LMMs) has attracted significant interest from the image segmentation community. To align with the next-token-prediction paradigm, current LMM-driven segmentation methods either use object boundary points to represent masks or introduce special segmentation tokens, whose hidden states are decoded by a segmentation model requiring the original image as input. However, these approaches often suffer from inadequate mask representation and complex architectures, limiting the potential of LMMs. In this work, we propose the Hierarchical Mask Tokenizer (HiMTok), which represents segmentation masks with up to 32 tokens and eliminates the need for the original image during mask de-tokenization. HiMTok allows for compact and coarse-to-fine mask representations, aligning well with the LLM next-token-prediction paradigm and facilitating the direct acquisition of segmentation capabilities. We develop a 3-stage training recipe for progressive learning of segmentation and visual capabilities, featuring a hierarchical mask loss for effective coarse-to-fine learning. Additionally, we enable bidirectional information flow, allowing conversion between bounding boxes and mask tokens to fully leverage multi-task training potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various segmentation tasks,while also enhancing visual grounding and maintaining overall visual understanding.

  We propose a new task to benchmark human-in-scene understanding for embodied agents: Human-In-Scene Question Answering (HIS-QA). Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models. The codes and data:this https URL.

  Current object detectors excel at entity localization and classification, yet exhibit inherent limitations in event recognition capabilities. This deficiency arises from their architecture's emphasis on discrete object identification rather than modeling the compositional reasoning, inter-object correlations, and contextual semantics essential for comprehensive event understanding. To address this challenge, we present a novel framework that expands the capability of standard object detectors beyond mere object recognition to complex event understanding through LLM-guided symbolic reasoning. Our key innovation lies in bridging the semantic gap between object detection and event understanding without requiring expensive task-specific training. The proposed plug-and-play framework interfaces with any open-vocabulary detector while extending their inherent capabilities across architectures. At its core, our approach combines (i) a symbolic regression mechanism exploring relationship patterns among detected entities and (ii) a LLM-guided strategically guiding the search toward meaningful expressions. These discovered symbolic rules transform low-level visual perception into interpretable event understanding, providing a transparent reasoning path from objects to events with strong transferability acrossthis http URLcompared our training-free framework against specialized event recognition systems across diverse application domains. Experiments demonstrate that our framework enhances multiple object detector architectures to recognize complex events such as illegal fishing activities (75% AUROC, +8.36% improvement), construction safety violations (+15.77%), and abnormal crowd behaviors (+23.16%).

  Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating complex social phenomena using human-like agents with specific traits. In human societies, value similarity is important for building trust and close relationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true in artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among LLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we evaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective model and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main experiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and analyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness following a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to investigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents with higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal closeness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a valid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the mechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a foundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.

  Text data augmentation is a widely used strategy for mitigating data sparsity in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in low-resource settings where limited samples hinder effective semantic modeling. While augmentation can improve input diversity and downstream interpretability, existing techniques often lack mechanisms to ensure semantic preservation during large-scale or iterative generation, leading to redundancy and instability. This work introduces a principled evaluation framework for large language model (LLM) based text augmentation, comprising two components: (1) Scalability Analysis, which measures semantic consistency as augmentation volume increases, and (2) Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR), which evaluates semantic drift across recursive paraphrasing cycles. Empirical evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs show that GPT-3.5 Turbo achieved the best balance of semantic fidelity, diversity, and generation efficiency. Applied to a real-world topic modeling task using BERTopic with GPT-enhanced few-shot labeling, the proposed approach results in a 400% increase in topic granularity and complete elimination of topic overlaps. These findings validated the utility of the proposed frameworks for structured evaluation of LLM-based augmentation in practical NLP pipelines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs encounter significant challenges in resource consumption nowadays, especially with long contexts. Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs, which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without appreciably sacrificing performance. Experiments on different series of models show the generalizability of IAM. Importantly, it is also orthogonal to many existing KV cache optimization methods, making it a versatile addition to the current toolkit for enhancing LLM efficiency.

  Autoregressive language models are constrained by their inherently sequential nature, generating one token at a time. This paradigm limits inference speed and parallelism, especially during later stages of generation when the direction and semantics of text are relatively certain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages the inherent knowledge of vanilla autoregressive language models about future tokens, combining techniques to realize this potential and enable simultaneous prediction of multiple subsequent tokens. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a masked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted from a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original LLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a lightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from the predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including a consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated tokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens quadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity. Our method achieves significant speedups through supervised fine-tuning on pretrained models. For example, it generates code and math nearly 5x faster, and improves general chat and knowledge tasks by almost 2.5x. These gains come without any loss in quality.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to their safe and reliable deployment.

  Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework.

  Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionised many fields, with LLM-as-a-service (LLMSaaS) offering accessible, general-purpose solutions without costly task-specific training. In contrast to the widely studied prompt engineering for directly solving tasks (in vivo), this paper explores LLMs' potential for in-vitro applications: using LLM-generated labels to improve supervised training of mainstream models. We examine two strategies - (1) noisy label correction and (2) training data augmentation - in empathy computing, an emerging task to predict psychology-based questionnaire outcomes from inputs like textual narratives. Crowdsourced datasets in this domain often suffer from noisy labels that misrepresent underlying empathy. We show that replacing or supplementing these crowdsourced labels with LLM-generated labels, developed using psychology-based scale-aware prompts, achieves statistically significant accuracy improvements. Notably, the RoBERTa pre-trained language model (PLM) trained with noise-reduced labels yields a state-of-the-art Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.648 on the public NewsEmp benchmarks. This paper further analyses evaluation metric selection and demographic biases to help guide the future development of more equitable empathy computing models.

  Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs) before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers, while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is challenging due to the substantial computational resources required. Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i) initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii) refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and $1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.

  This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing on the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and category-sensitive patterns.

  Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g., bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs, and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

  For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular, rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding. Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues. Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data integration processes and interoperability across institutions.

  While end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown impressive performance in transcribing general speech, they often struggle to accurately recognize contextually relevant keywords, such as proper nouns or user-specific entities.Previous approaches have explored leveraging keyword dictionaries in the textual modality to improve keyword recognition, either through token-level fusion that guides token-by-token generation or phrase-level fusion that enables direct copying of keyword phrases.However, these methods operate at different granularities and have their own limitations.In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained fusion approach that jointly leverages the strengths of both token-level and phrase-level fusion with Large Language Models (LLMs).Our approach incorporates a late-fusion strategy that elegantly combines ASR's acoustic information with LLM's rich contextual knowledge, balancing fine-grained token precision with holistic phrase-level understanding.Experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while preserving high accuracy on non-keyword text.Ablation studies further confirm that the token-level and phrase-level components both contribute significantly to the performance gains, complementing each other in our joint multi-grained framework.The code and models will be publicly available atthis https URL.

  Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the inter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs. The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99% identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then, we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods, datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive, trustworthy, and human-centric.

  If AI models can detect when they are being evaluated, the effectiveness of evaluations might be compromised. For example, models could have systematically different behavior during evaluations, leading to less reliable benchmarks for deployment and governance decisions. We investigate whether frontier language models can accurately classify transcripts based on whether they originate from evaluations or real-world deployment, a capability we call evaluation awareness. To achieve this, we construct a diverse benchmark of 1,000 prompts and transcripts from 61 distinct datasets. These span public benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, SWEBench), real-world deployment interactions, and agent trajectories from scaffolding frameworks (e.g., web-browsing agents). Frontier models clearly demonstrate above-random evaluation awareness (Gemini-2.5-Pro reaches an AUC of $0.83$), but do not yet surpass our simple human baseline (AUC of $0.92$). Furthermore, both AI models and humans are better at identifying evaluations in agentic settings compared to chat settings. Additionally, we test whether models can identify the purpose of the evaluation. Under multiple-choice and open-ended questioning, AI models far outperform random chance in identifying what an evaluation is testing for. Our results indicate that frontier models already exhibit a substantial, though not yet superhuman, level of evaluation-awareness. We recommend tracking this capability in future models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems are experiencing a revolution driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the evaluation methodologies for these systems remain insufficient for their growing sophistication. While traditional automatic metrics effectively assessed earlier modular systems, they focus solely on the dialogue level and cannot detect critical intermediate errors that can arise during user-agent interactions. In this paper, we introduce TD-EVAL (Turn and Dialogue-level Evaluation), a two-step evaluation framework that unifies fine-grained turn-level analysis with holistic dialogue-level comparisons. At turn level, we evaluate each response along three TOD-specific dimensions: conversation cohesion, backend knowledge consistency, and policy compliance. Meanwhile, we design TOD Agent Arena that uses pairwise comparisons to provide a measure of dialogue-level quality. Through experiments on MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench, we demonstrate that TD-EVAL effectively identifies the conversational errors that conventional metrics miss. Furthermore, TD-EVAL exhibits better alignment with human judgments than traditional and LLM-based metrics. These findings demonstrate that TD-EVAL introduces a new paradigm for TOD system evaluation, efficiently assessing both turn and system levels with a plug-and-play framework for future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Negation plays an important role in various natural language processing tasks such as Natural Language Inference and Sentiment Analysis tasks. Numerous prior studies have found that contextual text embedding models such as BERT, ELMO, RoBERTa or XLNet face challenges in accurately understanding negation. Recent advancements in universal text embeddings have demonstrated superior performance over contextual text embeddings in various tasks. However, due to the bias in popular evaluation benchmarks, the negation awareness capacity of these models remains unclear. To bridge the gap in existing literature, an in-depth analysis is initiated in this work to study the negation awareness of cutting-edge universal text embedding models. Our findings reveal a significant lack of negation awareness in these models, often interpreting negated text pairs as semantically similar. To efficiently deal with the conflict that different tasks need different trade-offs between topic and negation information among other semantic information, a data-efficient and computational-efficient embedding re-weighting method is proposed without modifying the parameters of text embedding models. The proposed solution is able to improve text embedding models' negation awareness significantly on both simple negation understanding task and complex negation understanding task. Furthermore, the proposed solution can also significantly improve the negation awareness of Large Language Model based task-specific high dimensional universal text embeddings.

  Generative large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated gaps in diverse cultural awareness across the globe. We investigate the effect of retrieval augmented generation and search-grounding techniques on LLMs' ability to display familiarity with various national cultures. Specifically, we compare the performance of standard LLMs, LLMs augmented with retrievals from a bespoke knowledge base (i.e., KB grounding), and LLMs augmented with retrievals from a web search (i.e., search grounding) on multiple cultural awareness benchmarks. We find that search grounding significantly improves the LLM performance on multiple-choice benchmarks that test propositional knowledge (e.g., cultural norms, artifacts, and institutions), while KB grounding's effectiveness is limited by inadequate knowledge base coverage and a suboptimal retriever. However, search grounding also increases the risk of stereotypical judgments by language models and fails to improve evaluators' judgments of cultural familiarity in a human evaluation with adequate statistical power. These results highlight the distinction between propositional cultural knowledge and open-ended cultural fluency when it comes to evaluating LLMs' cultural awareness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are often asked to generate structured outputs that obey precise syntactic rules, such as code snippets or formatted data. Grammar-constrained decoding (GCD) can guarantee that LLM outputs matches such rules by masking out tokens that will provably lead to outputs that do not belong to a specified context-free grammar (CFG). To guarantee soundness, GCD algorithms have to compute how a given LLM subword tokenizer can align with the tokens usedby a given context-free grammar and compute token masks based on this information. Doing so efficiently is challenging and existing GCD algorithms require tens of minutes to preprocess common grammars. We present a new GCD algorithm together with an implementation that offers 17.71x faster offline preprocessing than existing approaches while preserving state-of-the-art efficiency in online mask computation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite their success, Large-Language Models (LLMs) still face criticism due to their lack of interpretability. Traditional post-hoc interpretation methods, based on attention and gradient-based analysis, offer limited insights as they only approximate the model's decision-making processes and have been proved to be unreliable. For this reason, Concept-Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have been lately proposed in the textual field to provide interpretable predictions based on human-understandable concepts. However, CBMs still exhibit several limitations due to their architectural constraints limiting their expressivity, to the absence of task-interpretability when employing non-linear task predictors and for requiring extensive annotations that are impractical for real-world text data. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a novel Linearly Interpretable Concept Embedding Model (LICEM) going beyond the current accuracy-interpretability trade-off. LICEMs classification accuracy is better than existing interpretable models and matches black-box ones. We show that the explanations provided by our models are more interveneable and causally consistent with respect to existing solutions. Finally, we show that LICEMs can be trained without requiring any concept supervision, as concepts can be automatically predicted when using an LLM backbone.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training data, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots. Recent advancements, however, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time information retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While prior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites, their capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains unexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic attributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic dataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international participants, we show that these models can access social media content and predict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic dataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles, which may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal activity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science in the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information operations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. We recommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing applications, while preserving controlled access for verified research purposes.

  ELOQUENT is a set of shared tasks that aims to create easily testable high-level criteria for evaluating generative language models. Sensemaking is one such shared task.In Sensemaking, we try to assess how well generative models ``make sense out of a given text'' in three steps inspired by exams in a classroom setting: (1) Teacher systems should prepare a set of questions, (2) Student systems should answer these questions, and (3) Evaluator systems should score these answers, all adhering rather strictly to a given set of input materials.We report on the 2025 edition of Sensemaking, where we had 7 sources of test materials (fact-checking analyses of statements, textbooks, transcribed recordings of a lecture, and educational videos) spanning English, German, Ukrainian, and Czech languages.This year, 4 teams participated, providing us with 2 Teacher submissions, 2 Student submissions, and 2 Evaluator submissions. We added baselines for Teacher and Student using commercial large language model systems. We devised a fully automatic evaluation procedure, which we compare to a minimalistic manual evaluation.We were able to make some interesting observations. For the first task, the creation of questions, better evaluation strategies will still have to be devised because it is difficult to discern the quality of the various candidate question sets. In the second task, question answering, the LLMs examined overall perform acceptably, but restricting their answers to the given input texts remains problematic. In the third task, evaluation of question answers, our adversarial tests reveal that systems using the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm erroneously rate both garbled question-answer pairs and answers to mixed-up questions as acceptable.

  This paper presents an intervention study on the effects of the combined methods of (1) the Socratic method, (2) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, (3) simplified gamification and (4) formative feedback on university students' Maths learning driven by large language models (LLMs). We call our approach Mathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students struggle with Maths and as a result avoid Math-related discipline or subjects despite the importance of Maths across many fields, including signal processing. Oftentimes, students' Maths difficulties stem from suboptimal pedagogy. We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT) method to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after randomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students. Samples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade School Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH) datasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a manageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were used to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer 4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for capability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the MEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even much better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH dataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult Maths problems.

  We investigate the abilities of 28 Large language Models (LLMs) to reason about cardinal directions (CDs) using a benchmark generated from a set of templates, extensively testing an LLM's ability to determine the correct CD given a particular scenario. The templates allow for a number of degrees of variation such as means of locomotion of the agent involved, and whether set in the first, second or third person. Even the newer Large Reasoning Models are unable to reliably determine the correct CD for all questions. This paper summarises and extends earlier work presented at COSIT-24.

  The following paper introduces a general linguistic creativity test for humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). The test consists of various tasks aimed at assessing their ability to generate new original words and phrases based on word formation processes (derivation and compounding) and on metaphorical language use. We administered the test to 24 humans and to an equal number of LLMs, and we automatically evaluated their answers using OCSAI tool for three criteria: Originality, Elaboration, and Flexibility. The results show that LLMs not only outperformed humans in all the assessed criteria, but did better in six out of the eight test tasks. We then computed the uniqueness of the individual answers, which showed some minor differences between humans and LLMs. Finally, we performed a short manual analysis of the dataset, which revealed that humans are more inclined towards E(extending)-creativity, while LLMs favor F(ixed)-creativity.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide accurate word definitions and explanations for any context. However, the scope of the definition changes for different target groups, like children or language learners. This is especially relevant for homonyms, words with multiple meanings, where oversimplification might risk information loss by omitting key senses, potentially misleading users who trust LLM outputs. We investigate how simplification impacts homonym definition quality across three target groups: Normal, Simple, and ELI5. Using two novel evaluation datasets spanning multiple languages, we test DeepSeek v3, Llama 4 Maverick, Qwen3-30B A3B, GPT-4o mini, and Llama 3.1 8B via LLM-as-Judge and human annotations. Our results show that simplification drastically degrades definition completeness by neglecting polysemy, increasing the risk of misunderstanding. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B with Direct Preference Optimization substantially improves homonym response quality across all prompt types. These findings highlight the need to balance simplicity and completeness in educational NLP to ensure reliable, context-aware definitions for all learners.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Task-agnostic prompt compression leverages the redundancy in natural language to reduce computational overhead and enhance information density within prompts, especially in long-context scenarios. Existing methods predominantly rely on information entropy as the metric to compress lexical units, aiming to achieve minimal information loss. However, these approaches overlook two critical aspects: (i) the importance of attention-critical tokens at the algorithmic level, and (ii) shifts in information entropy during the compression process. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a dynamic attention-aware approach for task-agnostic prompt compression (DAC). This approach effectively integrates entropy and attention information, dynamically sensing entropy shifts during compression to achieve fine-grained prompt compression. Extensive experiments across various domains, including LongBench, GSM8K, and BBH, show that DAC consistently yields robust and substantial improvements across a diverse range of tasks and LLMs, offering compelling evidence of its efficacy.

  Instruction-following capability has become a major ability to be evaluated for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing datasets, such as IFEval, are either predominantly monolingual and centered on English or simply machine translated to other languages, limiting their applicability in multilingual contexts. In this paper, we present an carefully-curated extension of IFEval to a localized multilingual version named Marco-Bench-MIF, covering 30 languages with varying levels of localization. Our benchmark addresses linguistic constraints (e.g., modifying capitalization requirements for Chinese) and cultural references (e.g., substituting region-specific company names in prompts) via a hybrid pipeline combining translation with verification. Through comprehensive evaluation of 20+ LLMs on our Marco-Bench-MIF, we found that: (1) 25-35% accuracy gap between high/low-resource languages, (2) model scales largely impact performance by 45-60% yet persists script-specific challenges, and (3) machine-translated data underestimates accuracy by7-22% versus localized data. Our analysis identifies challenges in multilingual instruction following, including keyword consistency preservation and compositional constraint adherence across languages.

  _Jiachen Zhao, Jing Huang, Zhengxuan Wu, David Bau, Weiyan Shi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness. Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a new perspective to study AI safety

  _Kazuyoshi Otsuka_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study positions large language models (LLMs) as "subjective literary critics" to explore aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in literary assessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into English and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent sessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed significant variations in evaluation consistency ({\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to 0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance across stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming distinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session within-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically minimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped by RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that LLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human critical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers.

  Human reasoning involves different strategies, each suited to specific problems. Prior work shows that large language model (LLMs) tend to favor a single reasoning strategy, potentially limiting their effectiveness in diverse reasoning challenges. In this work, we investigate whether prompting can control LLMs reasoning strategies and assess its impact on logical problem-solving. While our experiments show that no single strategy consistently improves accuracy, performance could be enhanced if models could adaptively choose the optimal strategy. We propose methods to guide LLMs in strategy selection, highlighting new ways to refine their reasoning abilities.

  This paper explores the design of an aspect-based sentiment analysis system using large language models (LLMs) for real-world use. We focus on quadruple opinion extraction -- identifying aspect categories, sentiment polarity, targets, and opinion expressions from text data across different domains and languages. We investigate whether a single fine-tuned model can effectively handle multiple domain-specific taxonomies simultaneously. We demonstrate that a combined multi-domain model achieves performance comparable to specialized single-domain models while reducing operational complexity. We also share lessons learned for handling non-extractive predictions and evaluating various failure modes when developing LLM-based systems for structured prediction tasks.

  Recent shifts in the space of large language model (LLM) research have shown an increasing focus on novel architectures to compete with prototypical Transformer-based models that have long dominated this space. Linear recurrent models have proven to be a viable competitor due to their computational efficiency. However, such models still demonstrate a sizable gap compared to Transformers in terms of in-context learning among other tasks that require recalling information from a context. In this work, we introduce Resona, a simple and scalable framework for augmenting linear recurrent models with retrieval. Resona augments models with the ability to integrate retrieved information from the provided input context, enabling tailored behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments on a variety of linear recurrent models demonstrate that Resona-augmented models observe significant performance gains on a variety of synthetic as well as real-world natural language tasks, highlighting its ability to act as a general purpose method to improve the in-context learning and language modeling abilities of linear recurrent LLMs.

  Academic paper review is a critical yet time-consuming task within the research community. With the increasing volume of academic publications, automating the review process has become a significant challenge. The primary issue lies in generating comprehensive, accurate, and reasoning-consistent review comments that align with human reviewers' judgments. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing ReviewAgents, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate academic paper reviews. We first introduce a novel dataset, Review-CoT, consisting of 142k review comments, designed for training LLM agents. This dataset emulates the structured reasoning process of human reviewers-summarizing the paper, referencing relevant works, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and generating a review conclusion. Building upon this, we train LLM reviewer agents capable of structured reasoning using a relevant-paper-aware training method. Furthermore, we construct ReviewAgents, a multi-role, multi-LLM agent review framework, to enhance the review comment generation process. Additionally, we propose ReviewBench, a benchmark for evaluating the review comments generated by LLMs. Our experimental results on ReviewBench demonstrate that while existing LLMs exhibit a certain degree of potential for automating the review process, there remains a gap when compared to human-generated reviews. Moreover, our ReviewAgents framework further narrows this gap, outperforming advanced LLMs in generating review comments.

  To advance personalized applications such as recommendation systems and user behavior prediction, recent research increasingly adopts large language models (LLMs) for human -readable persona modeling. In dynamic real -world scenarios, effective persona modeling necessitates leveraging streaming behavior data to continually optimize user personas. However, existing methods -whether regenerating personas or incrementally extending them with new behaviors -often fail to achieve sustained improvements in persona quality or future behavior prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose DEEPER, a novel approach for dynamic persona modeling that enables continual persona optimization. Specifically, we enhance the model's direction -search capability through an iterative reinforcement learning framework, allowing it to automatically identify effective update directions and optimize personas using discrepancies between user behaviors and model predictions. Extensive experiments on dynamic persona modeling involving 4800 users across 10 domains highlight the superior persona optimization capabilities of DEEPER, delivering an impressive 32.2% average reduction in user behavior prediction error over four update rounds -outperforming the best baseline by a remarkable 22.92%.

  Modern language models are trained on large, unstructured datasets consisting of trillions of tokens and obtained by crawling the web. The unstructured nature makes it difficult to reason about their contents and develop systematic approaches to data curation. In this paper, we unpack monolithic web corpora by developing taxonomies of their contents and organizing them into domains. We introduce WebOrganizer, a framework for organizing web pages in terms of both their topic and format. Using these two complementary notions of domains, we automatically annotate pre-training data by distilling annotations from a large language model into efficient classifiers. This allows us to study how data from different domains should be mixed to improve models on downstream tasks, and we show that we can combine insights about effective topics and formats to further boost performance. We demonstrate that our domain mixing also improves existing methods that select data based on quality. Furthermore, we study and compare how quality-based methods will implicitly change the domain mixture. Overall, our work demonstrates that constructing and mixing domains provides a valuable complement to quality-based data curation methods, opening new avenues for effective and insightful pre-training data curation.

  The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a significant challenge due to their computational demands, specially on tasks requiring long outputs. However, natural language often contains redundancy, which presents an opportunity for optimization. We have observed that LLMs can generate distilled language-concise outputs that retain essential meaning, when prompted appropriately. We propose TRIM, a pipeline for saving computational cost in which a shorter distilled output from the LLM is reconstructed into a full narrative by a smaller model with lower inference costs. Our experiments show promising results, particularly in general knowledge domains with 20.58% saved tokens on average with tiny decrease in evaluation metrics, hinting that this approach can effectively balance efficiency and accuracy in language processing tasks.

  Human processing of idioms relies on understanding the contextual sentences in which idioms occur, as well as language-intrinsic features such as frequency and speaker-intrinsic factors like familiarity. While LLMs have shown high performance on idiomaticity detection tasks, this success may be attributed to reasoning shortcuts in existing datasets. To this end, we construct a novel, controlled contrastive dataset designed to test whether LLMs can effectively use context to disambiguate idiomatic meaning. Additionally, we explore how collocational frequency and sentence probability influence model performance. Our findings reveal that LLMs often fail to resolve idiomaticity when it is required to attend to the surrounding context, and that models perform better on sentences that have higher likelihood. The collocational frequency of expressions also impacts performance. We make our code and dataset publicly available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have become integral tool for users from various backgrounds. LLMs, trained on vast corpora, reflect the linguistic and cultural nuances embedded in their pre-training data. However, the values and perspectives inherent in this data can influence the behavior of LLMs, leading to potential biases. As a result, the use of LLMs in contexts involving spiritual or moral values necessitates careful consideration of these underlying biases. Our work starts with verification of our hypothesis by testing the spiritual values of popular LLMs. Experimental results show that LLMs' spiritual values are quite diverse, as opposed to the stereotype of atheists or secularists. We then investigate how different spiritual values affect LLMs in social-fairness scenarios e.g., hate speech identification). Our findings reveal that different spiritual values indeed lead to different sensitivity to different hate target groups. Furthermore, we propose to continue pre-training LLMs on spiritual texts, and empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in mitigating spiritual bias.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but updating their knowledge post-training remains a critical challenge. While recent model editing techniques like Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) show promise, their effectiveness may vary based on the nature of the knowledge being edited. We introduce the concept of ``perplexingness'': the degree to which new knowledge conflicts with an LLM's learned conceptual hierarchies and categorical relationships. For instance, editing ``British Shorthair is a kind of cat'' to ``British Shorthair is a kind of dog'' represents a low-perplexingness edit within the same taxonomic level, while editing ``A cat is a kind of animal'' to ``A cat is a kind of plant'' represents a high-perplexingness edit that violates fundamental categorical boundaries. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we introduce HierarchyData, a carefully curated dataset of 99 hyponym-hypernym pairs across diverse categories. Through controlled experiments across three models and four editing methods, we demonstrate a strong negative correlation between the perplexingness of new knowledge and the effectiveness of knowledge editing. Our analysis reveals that edits involving more abstract concepts (hypernyms) generally exhibit higher perplexingness and are more resistant to modification than their specific counterparts (hyponyms). These findings highlight a fundamental challenge in LLM knowledge editing: the more a new fact contradicts an LLM's learned conceptual hierarchies, the harder it becomes to reliably encode that knowledge.

  Recent advances in language model interpretability have identified circuits, critical subnetworks that replicate model behaviors, yet how knowledge is structured within these crucial subnetworks remains opaque. To gain an understanding toward the knowledge in the circuits, we conduct systematic knowledge editing experiments on the circuits of the GPT-2 language model. Our analysis reveals intriguing patterns in how circuits respond to editing attempts, the extent of knowledge distribution across network components, and the architectural composition of knowledge-bearing circuits. These findings offer insights into the complex relationship between model circuits and knowledge representation, deepening the understanding of how information is organized within language models. Our findings offer novel insights into the ``meanings'' of the circuits, and introduce directions for further interpretability and safety research of language models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts.

  This paper introduces GeoChain, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating step-by-step geographic reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million Q&A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning, and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within MLLMs.

  Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge, human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then, conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld, a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

  Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process that enables logical inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reasoning has emerged as a key capability that distinguishes advanced AI systems from conventional models that empower chatbots. In this survey, we categorize existing methods along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) Regimes, which define the stage at which reasoning is achieved (either at inference time or through dedicated training); and (2) Architectures, which determine the components involved in the reasoning process, distinguishing between standalone LLMs and agentic compound systems that incorporate external tools, and multi-agent collaborations. Within each dimension, we analyze two key perspectives: (1) Input level, which focuses on techniques that construct high-quality prompts that the LLM condition on; and (2) Output level, which methods that refine multiple sampled candidates to enhance reasoning quality. This categorization provides a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape of LLM reasoning, highlighting emerging trends such as the shift from inference-scaling to learning-to-reason (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and the transition to agentic workflows (e.g., OpenAI Deep Research, Manus Agent). Additionally, we cover a broad spectrum of learning algorithms, from supervised fine-tuning to reinforcement learning such as PPO and GRPO, and the training of reasoners and verifiers. We also examine key designs of agentic workflows, from established patterns like generator-evaluator and LLM debate to recent innovations. ...

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to capture extensive world knowledge, yet how this is achieved without direct sensorimotor experience remains a fundamental puzzle. This study proposes a novel theoretical solution by introducing the Collective World Model hypothesis. We argue that an LLM does not learn a world model from scratch; instead, it learns a statistical approximation of a collective world model that is already implicitly encoded in human language through a society-wide process of embodied, interactive sense-making. To formalize this process, we introduce generative emergent communication (Generative EmCom), a framework built on the Collective Predictive Coding (CPC). This framework models the emergence of language as a process of decentralized Bayesian inference over the internal states of multiple agents. We argue that this process effectively creates an encoder-decoder structure at a societal scale: human society collectively encodes its grounded, internal representations into language, and an LLM subsequently decodes these symbols to reconstruct a latent space that mirrors the structure of the original collective representations. This perspective provides a principled, mathematical explanation for how LLMs acquire their capabilities. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) the formalization of the Generative EmCom framework, clarifying its connection to world models and multi-agent reinforcement learning, and 2) its application to interpret LLMs, explaining phenomena such as distributional semantics as a natural consequence of representation reconstruction. This work provides a unified theory that bridges individual cognitive development, collective language evolution, and the foundations of large-scale AI.

  Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power, general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an 18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in spatially complex areas.

  Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems. However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation, assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and (3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective foundation for multi-agent collaboration.

  Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental method in operations research, but formulating DP models has traditionally required expert knowledge of both the problem context and DP techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges due to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of training data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing LLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such as linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark covering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic evaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a 7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on hard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel synthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a limited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for diversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key insight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong correctness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such guarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse formulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both approaches and the importance of combining them.

  We introduce a modular harness design for LLM agents that composes of perception, memory, and reasoning components, enabling a single LLM or VLM backbone to tackle a wide spectrum of multi turn gaming environments without domain-specific engineering. Using classic and modern game suites as low-barrier, high-diversity testbeds, our framework provides a unified workflow for analyzing how each module affects performance across dynamic interactive settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the harness lifts gameplay performance consistently over un-harnessed baselines and reveals distinct contribution patterns, for example, memory dominates in long-horizon puzzles while perception is critical in vision noisy arcades. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our modular harness design in advancing general-purpose agent, given the familiarity and ubiquity of games in everyday human experience.

  Reasoning-capable language models achieve state-of-the-art performance in diverse complex tasks by generating long, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. While recent works show that base models can acquire such reasoning traces via reinforcement learning or distillation from stronger models like DeepSeek-R1, previous works demonstrate that even short CoT prompting without fine-tuning is able to improve reasoning. We ask whether long CoT can be induced in a base model using only prompting or minimal tuning. Using just 20 long CoT examples from the reasoning model \texttt{QwQ-32B-Preview}, we lightly fine-tune the base model \texttt{Qwen2.5-32B}. The resulting model outperforms the much larger \texttt{Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct}, showing that a handful of high-quality examples can unlock strong reasoning capabilities. We further explore using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators, enhanced with prompt engineering, multi-pass editing, and structural guidance. However, neither matches the performance of reasoning model traces, suggesting that certain latent qualities of expert CoT are difficult to replicate. We analyze key properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty, diversity, and answer length, that influence reasoning distillation. While challenges remain, we are optimistic that carefully curated human-written CoT, even in small quantities, can activate reasoning behaviors in base models. We release our human-authored dataset across refinement stages and invite further investigation into what makes small-scale reasoning supervision so effective.
