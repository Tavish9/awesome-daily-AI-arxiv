- **[RoboInspector: Unveiling the Unreliability of Policy Code for LLM-enabled Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21378)**  `arXiv:2508.21378`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in reasoning and code generation, enabling robotic manipulation to be initiated with just a single instruction. The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code required to control the robot. Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable policy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse requirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user instructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to drive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy code generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to unveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled robotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation task and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive experiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in two prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable behaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight for practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback that improves the reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in LLM-enabled robotic manipulation, evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first, and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets. The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process, while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data and managing bias.

- **[Model-Task Alignment Drives Distinct RL Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21188)**  `arXiv:2508.21188`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs, exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods remain effective.

- **[Refusal Tokens: A Simple Way to Calibrate Refusals in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06748)**  `arXiv:2412.06748`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A key component of building safe and reliable language models is enabling the models to appropriately refuse to follow certain instructions or answer certain questions. We may want models to output refusal messages for various categories of user queries, for example, ill-posed questions, instructions for committing illegal acts, or queries which require information past the model's knowledge horizon. Engineering models that refuse to answer such questions is complicated by the fact that an individual may want their model to exhibit varying levels of sensitivity for refusing queries of various categories, and different users may want different refusal rates. The current default approach involves training multiple models with varying proportions of refusal messages from each category to achieve the desired refusal rates, which is computationally expensive and may require training a new model to accommodate each user's desired preference over refusal rates. To address these challenges, we propose refusal tokens, one such token for each refusal category or a single refusal token, which are prepended to the model's responses during training. We then show how to increase or decrease the probability of generating the refusal token for each category during inference to steer the model's refusal behavior. Refusal tokens enable controlling a single model's refusal rates without the need of any further fine-tuning, but only by selectively intervening during generation.

- **[WebInject: Prompt Injection Attack to Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11717)**  `arXiv:2505.11717`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.CV`  
  _Xilong Wang, John Bloch, Zedian Shao, Yuepeng Hu, Shuyan Zhou, Neil Zhenqiang Gong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-based web agents interact with webpage environments by generating actions based on screenshots of the webpages. In this work, we propose WebInject, a prompt injection attack that manipulates the webpage environment to induce a web agent to perform an attacker-specified action. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the rendered webpage. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the perturbation induces the web agent to perform the attacker-specified action. We formulate the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple datasets shows that WebInject is highly effective and significantly outperforms baselines.

- **[BASE-Q: Bias and Asymmetric Scaling Enhanced Rotational Quantization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15689)**  `arXiv:2506.15689`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Liulu He, Shenli Zheng, Karwei Sun, Yijiang Liu, Yufei Zhao, Chongkang Tan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rotations have become essential to state-of-the-art quantization pipelines for large language models (LLMs) by effectively smoothing outliers in weights and activations. However, further optimizing the rotation parameters offers only limited performance gains and introduces significant training overhead: due to rotation parameter sharing, full-model must be loaded simultaneously to enable backpropagation, resulting in substantial memory consumption and limited practical utility. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of current rotational quantization methods: (i) rotation fails to align channel means, resulting in wider quantization bounds and increased rounding errors; and (ii) rotation makes the activation distribution more Gaussian-like, increasing energy loss caused by clipping errors. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{BASE-Q}, a simple yet powerful approach that combines bias correction and asymmetric scaling to effectively reduce rounding and clipping errors. Furthermore, BASE-Q enables blockwise optimization, eliminating the need for memory-intensive full-model backpropagation. Extensive experiments on various LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BASE-Q, narrowing the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5\%, 42.9\%, and 29.2\% compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively. The code will be released soon.

- **[ROSE: A Reward-Oriented Data Selection Framework for LLM Task-Specific Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00631)**  `arXiv:2412.00631`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Instruction tuning has underscored the significant potential of large language models (LLMs) in producing more human controllable and effective outputs in various domains. In this work, we focus on the data selection problem for task-specific instruction tuning of LLMs. Prevailing methods primarily rely on the crafted similarity metrics to select training data that aligns with the test data distribution. The goal is to minimize instruction tuning loss on the test data, ultimately improving performance on the target task. However, it has been widely observed that instruction tuning loss (i.e., cross-entropy loss for next token prediction) in LLMs often fails to exhibit a monotonic relationship with actual task performance. This misalignment undermines the effectiveness of current data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. To address this issue, we introduce ROSE, a novel Reward-Oriented inStruction data sElection method which leverages pairwise preference loss as a reward signal to optimize data selection for task-specific instruction tuning. Specifically, ROSE adapts an influence formulation to approximate the influence of training data points relative to a few-shot preference validation set to select the most task-related training data points. Experimental results show that by selecting just 5\% of the training data using ROSE, our approach can achieve competitive results compared to fine-tuning with the full training dataset, and it surpasses other state-of-the-art data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. Our qualitative analysis further confirms the robust generalizability of our method across multiple benchmark datasets and diverse model architectures.

- **[Automating the Deep Space Network Data Systems; A Case Study in Adaptive Anomaly Detection through Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21111)**  `arXiv:2508.21111`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Evan J. Chou, Lisa S. Locke, Harvey M. Soldan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction, parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system, we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data, completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous data.

  _Weida Wang, Dongchen Huang, Jiatong Li, Tengchao Yang, Ziyang Zheng, Di Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce CMPhysBench, designed to assess the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Condensed Matter Physics, as a novel Benchmark. CMPhysBench is composed of more than 520 graduate-level meticulously curated questions covering both representative subfields and foundational theoretical frameworks of condensed matter physics, such as magnetism, superconductivity, strongly correlated systems, etc. To ensure a deep understanding of the problem-solving process,we focus exclusively on calculation problems, requiring LLMs to independently generate comprehensive solutions. Meanwhile, leveraging tree-based representations of expressions, we introduce the Scalable Expression Edit Distance (SEED) score, which provides fine-grained (non-binary) partial credit and yields a more accurate assessment of similarity between prediction and ground-truth. Our results show that even the best models, Grok-4, reach only 36 average SEED score and 28% accuracy on CMPhysBench, underscoring a significant capability gap, especially for this practical and frontier domain relative to traditional physics. The code anddataset are publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[BudgetThinker: Empowering Budget-aware LLM Reasoning with Control Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17196)**  `arXiv:2508.17196`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have leveraged increased test-time computation to enhance reasoning capabilities, a strategy that, while effective, incurs significant latency and resource costs, limiting their applicability in real-world time-constrained or cost-sensitive scenarios. This paper introduces BudgetThinker, a novel framework designed to empower LLMs with budget-aware reasoning, enabling precise control over the length of their thought processes. We propose a methodology that periodically inserts special control tokens during inference to continuously inform the model of its remaining token budget. This approach is coupled with a comprehensive two-stage training pipeline, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to familiarize the model with budget constraints, followed by a curriculum-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase that utilizes a length-aware reward function to optimize for both accuracy and budget adherence. We demonstrate that BudgetThinker significantly surpasses strong baselines in maintaining performance across a variety of reasoning budgets on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Our method provides a scalable and effective solution for developing efficient and controllable LLM reasoning, making advanced models more practical for deployment in resource-constrained and real-time environments.

- **[ETTRL: Balancing Exploration and Exploitation in LLM Test-Time Reinforcement Learning Via Entropy Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11356)**  `arXiv:2508.11356`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Jia Liu, ChangYi He, YingQiao Lin, MingMin Yang, FeiYang Shen, ShaoGuo Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models have yielded significant improvements in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, these models remain heavily dependent on annotated data and exhibit limited adaptability in unsupervised scenarios. To address these limitations, test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) has been proposed, which enables self-optimization by leveraging model-generated pseudo-labels. Despite its promise, TTRL faces several key challenges, including high inference costs due to parallel rollouts and early-stage estimation bias that fosters overconfidence, reducing output diversity and causing performance plateaus. To address these challenges, we introduce an entropy-based mechanism to enhance the exploration-exploitation balance in test-time reinforcement learning through two strategies: Entropy-fork Tree Majority Rollout (ETMR) and Entropy-based Advantage Reshaping (EAR). Compared with the baseline, our approach enables Llama3.1-8B to achieve a 68 percent relative improvement in Pass at 1 metric on the AIME 2024 benchmark, while consuming only 60 percent of the rollout tokens budget. This highlights our method's ability to effectively optimize the trade-off between inference efficiency, diversity, and estimation robustness, thereby advancing unsupervised reinforcement learning for open-domain reasoning tasks.

- **[Beyond Frequency: The Role of Redundancy in Large Language Model Memorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12321)**  `arXiv:2506.12321`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Jie Zhang, Qinghua Zhao, Chi-ho Lin, Zhongfeng Kang, Lei Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Memorization in large language models poses critical risks for privacy and fairness as these systems scale to billions of parameters. While previous studies established correlations between memorization and factors like token frequency and repetition patterns, we revealed distinct response patterns: frequency increases minimally impact memorized samples (e.g. 0.09) while substantially affecting non-memorized samples (e.g., 0.25), with consistency observed across model scales. Through counterfactual analysis by perturbing sample prefixes and quantifying perturbation strength through token positional changes, we demonstrate that redundancy correlates with memorization patterns. Our findings establish that: about 79% of memorized samples are low-redundancy, these low-redundancy samples exhibit 2-fold higher vulnerability than high-redundancy ones, and consequently memorized samples drop by 0.6 under perturbation while non-memorized samples drop by only 0.01, indicating that more redundant content becomes both more memorable and more fragile. These findings suggest potential redundancy-guided approaches for data preprocessing, thereby reducing privacy risks and mitigating bias to ensure fairness in model deployments.

- **[Mamba State-Space Models Are Lyapunov-Stable Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00209)**  `arXiv:2406.00209`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _John T. Halloran, Manbir Gulati, Paul F. Roysdon_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mamba state-space models (SSMs) have recently outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer large language models (LLMs) in various tasks and been widely adapted. However, a major concern for stable learning in recurrent-based deep models (such as SSMs) is the sensitivity of their recurrent dynamics. Despite widespread adaptation, the sensitivity of Mamba's recurrent dynamics under common fine-tuning methods-e.g., mixed-precision fine-tuning (MPFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-remains unexplored. Empirically, we show that Mamba LLMs are extremely stable to changes introduced by combinations of MPFT and PEFT, in stark contrast to Transformer LLMs, which we demonstrate may drastically diverge from their respective full-precision counterparts under different combinations of MPFT and PEFT (despite the near-ubiquitous adaptation of these fine-tuning frameworks for attention-based models). The demonstrated robustness of Mamba LLMs are due to their recurrent dynamics, which we prove are guaranteed to be stable using dynamical systems theory (in particular, Lyapunov stability). We conclude by using MPFT and PEFT to novelly study Mamba LLMs' in-context learning (ICL) abilities on natural language tasks, thus supplementing other recent work.

  _Simone Scardapane_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural networks surround us, in the form of large language models, speech transcription systems, molecular discovery algorithms, robotics, and much more. Stripped of anything else, neural networks are compositions of differentiable primitives, and studying them means learning how to program and how to interact with these models, a particular example of what is called differentiable programming.This primer is an introduction to this fascinating field imagined for someone, like Alice, who has just ventured into this strange differentiable wonderland. I overview the basics of optimizing a function via automatic differentiation, and a selection of the most common designs for handling sequences, graphs, texts, and audios. The focus is on a intuitive, self-contained introduction to the most important design techniques, including convolutional, attentional, and recurrent blocks, hoping to bridge the gap between theory and code (PyTorch and JAX) and leaving the reader capable of understanding some of the most advanced models out there, such as large language models (LLMs) and multimodal architectures.

- **[QR-LoRA: QR-Based Low-Rank Adaptation for Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21810)**  `arXiv:2508.21810`  `cs.LG`  
  _Jessica Liang, Anirudh Bharadwaj_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors -- training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning, standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

- **[Improving Fisher Information Estimation and Efficiency for LoRA-based LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21300)**  `arXiv:2508.21300`  `cs.LG`  
  _Yejin Kim, Eunwon Kim, Buru Chang, Junsuk Choe_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch. Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[CALM: A Framework for Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21273)**  `arXiv:2508.21273`  `cs.LG`  
  _Ashok Devireddy, Shunping Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM (Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop, continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic, context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model, validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

  Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with IG.

- **[Adaptive LLM Routing under Budget Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21141)**  `arXiv:2508.21141`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries (in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

  _Xinxing Ren, Qianbo Zang, Zekun Guo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, LLMs still struggle in the simulation domain, particularly in generating Simulink models, which are essential tools in engineering and scientific research. Our preliminary experiments indicate that LLM agents often fail to produce reliable and complete Simulink simulation code from text-only inputs, likely due to the lack of Simulink-specific data in their pretraining. To address this challenge, we propose SimuGen, a multimodal agent-based framework that automatically generates accurate Simulink simulation code by leveraging both the visual Simulink diagram and domain knowledge. SimuGen coordinates several specialized agents, including an investigator, unit test reviewer, code generator, executor, debug locator, and report writer, supported by a domain-specific knowledge base. This collaborative and modular design enables interpretable, robust, and reproducible Simulink simulation generation. Our source code is publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[SpecPipe: Accelerating Pipeline Parallelism-based LLM Inference with Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04104)**  `arXiv:2504.04104`  `cs.LG`  
  _Haofei Yin, Mengbai Xiao, Tinghong Li, Xiao Zhang, Dongxiao Yu, Guanghui Zhang_

  The demand for large language model inference is rapidly increasing. Pipeline parallelism offers a cost-effective deployment strategy for distributed inference but suffers from high service latency. While incorporating speculative decoding to pipeline parallelism improves performance, it still faces challenges of low hardware utilization and narrow speculative window. Inspired by branch prediction in instruction pipelining, we introduce SpecPipe, which fills the pipeline with speculative tokens of a request step-by-step. By maximizing the hardware utilization, SpecPipe decodes one token per pipeline step ideally. Specifically, SpecPipe comprises a dynamic speculative token tree and a pipelined inference framework. The tree dynamically accepts tokens from a speculative token source and outputs the tokens to the inference pipeline. Since the speculative window relaxed in our framework, a high-accuracy draft model is integrated without fine-tuning. The pipeline inference framework follows node-wise computation, pruning propagation, and inter-node communication stages. We implement SpecPipe and a variant SpecPipe-DB with dynamic batching for single- and multi-request inference, respectively. On an 8-stage pipeline, SpecPipe improves time between tokens on diverse single-request workloads by $4.19\times$-$5.53\times$ over standard pipeline parallelism and by $2.08\times$-$2.38\times$ over prior tree-based speculative decoding methods. For multi-request workloads, SpecPipe-DB achieves $1.64\times$-$2.08\times$ higher throughput and $1.61\times$-$2.06\times$ lower time between tokens than vLLM.

  Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been specifically marketed towards oncology use.Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300 multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%, outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95% CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69). Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed clinical adaptation.Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement. While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert oversight before clinical implementation.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query. Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower computational cost.

  Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4 times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs. Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination. To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

  _Zhizhong Huang, Xiaoming Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models (e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture \textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only \textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen categories. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Despite significant progress, existing research on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) mainly focuses on general visual understanding, overlooking the ability to integrate textual context associated with objects for a more context-aware multimodal understanding -- an ability we refer to as Region-level Context-aware Multimodal Understanding (RCMU). To address this limitation, we first formulate the RCMU task, which requires models to respond to user instructions by integrating both image content and textual information of regions or objects. To equip MLLMs with RCMU capabilities, we propose Region-level Context-aware Visual Instruction Tuning (RCVIT), which incorporates object information into the model input and enables the model to utilize bounding box coordinates to effectively associate objects' visual content with their textual information. To address the lack of datasets, we introduce the RCMU dataset, a large-scale visual instruction tuning dataset that covers multiple RCMU tasks. We also propose RC\&P-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that can evaluate the performance of MLLMs in RCMU and multimodal personalized understanding tasks. Additionally, we propose a reference-free evaluation metric to perform a comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of the region-level context-aware image descriptions. By performing RCVIT on Qwen2-VL models with the RCMU dataset, we developed RC-Qwen2-VL models. Experimental results indicate that RC-Qwen2-VL models not only achieve outstanding performance on multiple RCMU tasks but also demonstrate successful applications in multimodal RAG and personalized conversation.

  If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today, would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective, distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively across downstream QA tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose models to specialized domains.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications. While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes, where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the effectiveness of our framework.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1) Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training) and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information screening for improving video-language understanding.

  Understanding multi-page documents poses a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as it requires fine-grained visual comprehension and multi-hop reasoning across pages. While prior work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing advanced reasoning in MLLMs, its application to multi-page document understanding remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework, Evidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO). EviGRPO incorporates an evidence-aware reward mechanism that promotes a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, guiding the model to first retrieve relevant pages before generating answers. This training paradigm enables us to build high-quality models with limited supervision. To support this, we design a two-stage annotation pipeline and a curriculum learning strategy, based on which we construct two datasets: EviBench, a high-quality training set with 4.8k examples, and ArxivFullQA, an evaluation benchmark with 8.6k QA pairs based on scientific papers. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that DocR1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-page tasks, while consistently maintaining strong results on single-page benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of NLP tasks, but they remain fundamentally stateless, constrained by limited context windows that hinder long-horizon reasoning. Recent efforts to address this limitation often augment LLMs with an external memory bank, yet most existing pipelines are static and heuristic-driven, lacking any learned mechanism for deciding what to store, update, or retrieve. We present Memory-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that equips LLMs with the ability to actively manage and utilize external memory through two specialized agents: a Memory Manager that learns to perform structured memory operations, including adding, updating, deleting, or taking no operation on memory entries; and an Answer Agent that selects the most relevant entries and reasons over them to produce an answer. Both agents are fine-tuned with outcome-driven RL (PPO and GRPO), enabling adaptive memory management and utilization with minimal supervision. With as few as 152 question-answer pairs and a corresponding temporal memory bank for training, Memory-R1 outperforms the strongest existing baseline and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse question types and LLM backbones. Beyond presenting an effective approach, this work provides insights into how RL can unlock more agentic, memory-aware behavior in LLMs, pointing toward richer, more persistent reasoning systems.

  Emotion recognition in low-resource languages like Marathi remains challenging due to limited annotated data. We present L3Cube-MahaEmotions, a high-quality Marathi emotion recognition dataset with 11 fine-grained emotion labels. The training data is synthetically annotated using large language models (LLMs), while the validation and test sets are manually labeled to serve as a reliable gold-standard benchmark. Building on the MahaSent dataset, we apply the Chain-of-Translation (CoTR) prompting technique, where Marathi sentences are translated into English and emotion labeled via a single prompt. GPT-4 and Llama3-405B were evaluated, with GPT-4 selected for training data annotation due to superior label quality. We evaluate model performance using standard metrics and explore label aggregation strategies (e.g., Union, Intersection). While GPT-4 predictions outperform fine-tuned BERT models, BERT-based models trained on synthetic labels fail to surpass GPT-4. This highlights both the importance of high-quality human-labeled data and the inherent complexity of emotion recognition. An important finding of this work is that generic LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama3-405B generalize better than fine-tuned BERT for complex low-resource emotion recognition tasks.

  As large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity for a variety of use cases, making them adaptable and controllable has become increasingly important, especially for user-facing applications. While the existing literature on LLM adaptation primarily focuses on finding a model (or models) that optimizes a single predefined objective, here we focus on the challenging case where the model must dynamically adapt to diverse -- and often changing -- user preferences. For this, we leverage adaptation methods based on linear weight interpolation, casting them as continuous multi-domain interpolators that produce models with specific prescribed generation characteristics on-the-fly. Specifically, we use low-rank updates to fine-tune a base model to various different domains, yielding a set of anchor models with distinct generation profiles. Then, we use the weight updates of these anchor models to parametrize the entire (infinite) class of models contained within their convex hull. We empirically show that varying the interpolation weights yields predictable and consistent change in the model outputs with respect to all of the controlled attributes. We find that there is little entanglement between most attributes and identify and discuss the pairs of attributes for which this is not the case. Our results suggest that linearly interpolating between the weights of fine-tuned models facilitates predictable, fine-grained control of model outputs with respect to multiple stylistic characteristics simultaneously.

  The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks, our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some skills to be more difficult than others.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026 expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

  Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence. PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500, +9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in 16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the effectiveness of PiCSAR.

  AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models (LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

  We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies. The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards (August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs.

  Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

  The proliferation of textual data containing sensitive personal information across various domains requires robust anonymization techniques to protect privacy and comply with regulations, while preserving data usability for diverse and crucial downstream tasks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of current trends and recent advances in text anonymization techniques. We begin by discussing foundational approaches, primarily centered on Named Entity Recognition, before examining the transformative impact of Large Language Models, detailing their dual role as sophisticated anonymizers and potent de-anonymization threats. The survey further explores domain-specific challenges and tailored solutions in critical sectors such as healthcare, law, finance, and education. We investigate advanced methodologies incorporating formal privacy models and risk-aware frameworks, and address the specialized subfield of authorship anonymization. Additionally, we review evaluation frameworks, comprehensive metrics, benchmarks, and practical toolkits for real-world deployment of anonymization solutions. This review consolidates current knowledge, identifies emerging trends and persistent challenges, including the evolving privacy-utility trade-off, the need to address quasi-identifiers, and the implications of LLM capabilities, and aims to guide future research directions for both academics and practitioners in this field.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a 7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments.

  This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness, technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic summarization assessment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First, it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights, we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions: no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini" label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings. Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

  Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs, from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270 pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands -- heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a new frontier for scaling the performance of Large Language Models. In test-time scaling, by using more computational resources during inference, LLMs can improve their reasoning process and task performance. Several approaches have emerged for TTS such as distilling reasoning traces from another model or exploring the vast decoding search space by employing a verifier. The verifiers serve as reward models that help score the candidate outputs from the decoding process to diligently explore the vast solution space and select the best outcome. This paradigm commonly termed has emerged as a superior approach owing to parameter free scaling at inference time and high performance gains. The verifiers could be prompt-based, fine-tuned as a discriminative or generative model to verify process paths, outcomes or both. Despite their widespread adoption, there is no detailed collection, clear categorization and discussion of diverse verification approaches and their training mechanisms. In this survey, we cover the diverse approaches in the literature and present a unified view of verifier training, types and their utility in test-time scaling.

  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable problem-solving abilities, but struggle with complex tasks due to static internal knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances access to external information, yet remains limited in multi-hop reasoning and strategic search due to rigid workflows. Recent advancements in agentic deep research empower LLMs to autonomously reason, search, and synthesize information. However, current approaches relying on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) face critical issues such as conflicting gradients and reward sparsity, limiting performance gains and training efficiency. To address these, we first propose Atomic Thought, a novel LLM thinking paradigm that decomposes reasoning into fine-grained functional units. These units are supervised by Reasoning Reward Models (RRMs), which provide Atomic Thought Rewards (ATR) for fine-grained guidance. Building on this, we propose Atom-Searcher, a novel RL framework for agentic deep research that integrates Atomic Thought and ATR. Atom-Searcher uses a curriculum-inspired reward schedule, prioritizing process-level ATR early and transitioning to outcome rewards, accelerating convergence on effective reasoning paths. Experiments on seven benchmarks show consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art. Key advantages include: (1) Atom-Searcher scales computation at test-time. (2) Atomic Thought provides supervision anchors for RRMs, bridging deep research tasks and RRMs. (3) Atom-Searcher exhibits more interpretable, human-like reasoning patterns.

  Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in understanding Structured Knowledge (SK) like KG and Table, existing evaluations for SK understanding are non-rigorous (i.e., lacking evaluations of specific capabilities) and focus on a single type of SK. Therefore, we aim to propose a more comprehensive and rigorous structured knowledge understanding benchmark to diagnose the shortcomings of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce SKA-Bench, a Structured Knowledge Augmented QA Benchmark that encompasses four widely used structured knowledge forms: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. We utilize a three-stage pipeline to construct SKA-Bench instances, which includes a question, an answer, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. To evaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we expand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness, Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical evaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1, indicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding structured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as the amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination phenomenon. Our dataset and code are available atthis https URL.

  Learning Japanese vocabulary is a challenge for learners from Roman alphabet backgrounds due to script differences. Japanese combines syllabaries like hiragana with kanji, which are logographic characters of Chinese origin. Kanji are also complicated due to their complexity and volume. Keyword mnemonics are a common strategy to aid memorization, often using the compositional structure of kanji to form vivid associations. Despite recent efforts to use large language models (LLMs) to assist learners, existing methods for LLM-based keyword mnemonic generation function as a black box, offering limited interpretability. We propose a generative framework that explicitly models the mnemonic construction process as driven by a set of common rules, and learn them using a novel Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm. Trained on learner-authored mnemonics from an online platform, our method learns latent structures and compositional rules, enabling interpretable and systematic mnemonics generation. Experiments show that our method performs well in the cold-start setting for new learners while providing insight into the mechanisms behind effective mnemonic creation.

  The hallucination of non-existent facts by LLMs is an important problem given its widespread adoption across various applications. Previous research addresses this problem by analyzing the internal parameterized knowledge boundaries to estimate confidence. However, these studies focus on the single-problem setting and have not explored the more challenging multi-problem setting, which requires accurately answering multiple questions simultaneously. We introduce a novel method for the multi-problem setting, Multiple Answers and Confidence Stepwise Tuning (MAC-Tuning), that separates the learning of answer prediction and confidence estimation during fine-tuning on instruction data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines by up to 25\% in average precision.

  Recently, deep reasoning LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1) have shown promising performance in various downstream tasks. Free translation is an important and interesting task in the multilingual world, which requires going beyond word-for-word translation. However, the task is still under-explored in deep reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DeepTrans, a deep reasoning translation model that learns free translation via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we carefully build a reward model with pre-defined scoring criteria on both the translation results and the thought processes. The reward model teaches DeepTrans how to think and free-translate the given sentences during RL. Besides, our RL training does not need any labeled translations, avoiding the human-intensive annotation or resource-intensive data synthesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness of DeepTrans. Using Qwen2.5-7B as the backbone, DeepTrans improves performance by 16.3% in literature translation, and outperforms strong deep reasoning LLMs. Moreover, we summarize the failures and interesting findings during our RL exploration. We hope this work could inspire other researchers in free translation.

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) introduces additional information to enhance large language models (LLMs). In machine translation (MT), previous work typically retrieves in-context examples from paired MT corpora, or domain-specific knowledge from knowledge graphs, to enhance MT models. However, a large amount of world knowledge is organized in unstructured documents, and might not be fully paired across different languages. In this paper, we study retrieval-augmented MT using unstructured documents. Specifically, we build RAGtrans, the first benchmark to train and evaluate LLMs' retrieval-augmented MT ability. RAGtrans contains 169K MT samples collected via GPT-4o and human translators. Besides, documents from various languages are also provided to supply the knowledge to these samples. Based on RAGtrans, we further propose a multi-task training method to teach LLMs how to use information from multilingual documents during their translation. The method uses existing multilingual corpora to create auxiliary training objectives without additional labeling requirements. Extensive experiments show that the method improves LLMs by 1.6-3.1 BLEU and 1.0-2.0 COMET scores in En-Zh, and 1.7-2.9 BLEU and 2.1-2.7 COMET scores in En-De. We also conclude the critical difficulties that current LLMs face with this task.

  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the ``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework. Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique: for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth" in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the "steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure. Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent, logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs. Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political architecture.

  Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and neuroscientific plausibility.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

  Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs, affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric. Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in society.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to paraphrase texts across different complexity levels is essential for creating accessible texts that can be tailored toward diverse reader groups. Thus, we introduce German4All, the first large-scale German dataset of aligned readability-controlled, paragraph-level paraphrases. It spans five readability levels and comprises over 25,000 samples. The dataset is automatically synthesized using GPT-4 and rigorously evaluated through both human and LLM-based judgments. Using German4All, we train an open-source, readability-controlled paraphrasing model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in German text simplification, enabling more nuanced and reader-specific adaptations. We opensource both the dataset and the model to encourage further research on multi-level paraphrasing

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive level of general knowledge. However, they often struggle in highly specialized and cost-sensitive domains such as drug discovery and rare disease research due to the lack of expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (PU-ADKA) designed to efficiently enhance domain-specific LLMs by actively engaging domain experts within a fixed budget. Unlike traditional fine-tuning approaches, PU-ADKA selectively identifies and queries the most appropriate expert from a team, taking into account each expert's availability, knowledge boundaries, and consultation costs. We train PU-ADKA using simulations on PubMed data and validate it through both controlled expert interactions and real-world deployment with a drug development team, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LLM performance in specialized domains under strict budget constraints. In addition to outlining our methodological innovations and experimental results, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, CKAD, for cost-effective LLM domain knowledge acquisition to foster further research in this challenging area.

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. Current hybrid RAG system retrieves evidence from both knowledge graphs (KGs) and text documents to support LLM reasoning. However, it faces challenges like handling multi-hop reasoning, multi-entity questions, multi-source verification, and effective graph utilization. To address these limitations, we present Hydra, a training-free framework that unifies graph topology, document semantics, and source reliability to support deep, faithful reasoning in LLMs. Hydra handles multi-hop and multi-entity problems through agent-driven exploration that combines structured and unstructured retrieval, increasing both diversity and precision of evidence. To tackle multi-source verification, Hydra uses a tri-factor cross-source verification (source trustworthiness assessment, cross-source corroboration, and entity-path alignment), to balance topic relevance with cross-modal agreement. By leveraging graph structure, Hydra fuses heterogeneous sources, guides efficient exploration, and prunes noise early. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show that Hydra achieves overall state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks with GPT-3.5, outperforming the strong hybrid baseline ToG-2 by an average of 20.3% and up to 30.1%. Furthermore, Hydra enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo. The source code is available onthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly shape political discourse, yet exhibit inconsistent responses when challenged. While prior research categorizes LLMs as left- or right-leaning based on single-prompt responses, a critical question remains: Do these classifications reflect stable ideologies or superficial mimicry? Existing methods cannot distinguish between genuine ideological alignment and performative text generation. To address this, we propose a framework for evaluating ideological depth through (1) argumentative consistency and (2) uncertainty quantification. Testing 12 LLMs on 19 economic policies from the Political Compass Test, we classify responses as stable or performative ideological positioning. Results show 95% of left-leaning models and 89% of right-leaning models demonstrate behavior consistent with our classifications across different experimental conditions. Furthermore, semantic entropy strongly validates our classifications (AUROC=0.78), revealing uncertainty's relationship to ideological consistency. Our findings demonstrate that ideological stability is topic-dependent and challenge the notion of monolithic LLM ideologies, and offer a robust way to distinguish genuine alignment from performative behavior.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in handling complex reasoning tasks, which are usually achieved by constructing a thought chain to guide the model in solving the problem with multi-step thinking. However, existing methods often remain confined to previously explored solution spaces and thus overlook the critical blind spot within LLMs' cognitive range. To address these issues, we introduce the ``Thought Space Explorer'' (TSE), a novel framework to expand and optimize thought structures to guide LLMs to explore their blind spots of thinking. By generating new reasoning steps and branches based on the original thought structure with various designed strategies, TSE broadens the thought exploration view and alleviates the impact of blind spots for LLM reasoning. Experimental results on multiple levels of reasoning tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TSE by surpassing various baseline methods. We also conduct extensive analysis to understand how structured and expansive thought can contribute to unleashing the potential of LLM reasoning capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Processing long contexts is increasingly important for Large Language Models (LLMs) in tasks like multi-turn dialogues, code generation, and document summarization. This paper addresses the challenges of achieving high long-context performance, low computational complexity, and compatibility with pretrained models -- collectively termed the ``impossible triangle''. We introduce E2LLM (Encoder Elongated Large Language Models), a novel approach that effectively navigates this paradox. E2LLM divides long contexts into chunks, compresses each into soft prompts using a pretrained text encoder, and aligns these representations with a decoder-only LLM via an adapter. To enhance the LLM's reasoning with these soft prompts, we employ two training objectives: encoder output reconstruction and long-context instruction fine-tuning. Extensive experiments reveal that E2LLM not only outperforms 8 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in effectiveness and efficiency for document summarization and question answering, but also achieves the best performance on LongBench v2 among models of comparable size.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care, but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes, simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

  _Mohsen Nayebi Kerdabadi, Arya Hadizadeh Moghaddam, Dongjie Wang, Zijun Yao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships, overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

  Mathematical geometric problem solving (GPS) demands verifiable logical coherence and multimodal reasoning capabilities. While large language models (LLMs) have shown rapid progress in GPS, their advancement is hindered by the lack of reliable benchmarks and systematic methodologies. A critical challenge is the inherent hallucination in LLMs, which leads to synthetic GPS datasets that are often noisy, unverified, and self-contradictory. To address this, we introduce TrustGeoGen, a data engine that generates formally verified geometric problems to establish a principled and trustworthy benchmark. Our engine integrates four key innovations: 1) Multimodal Alignment, which synchronizes the generation of diagrams, text, and step-by-step solutions; 2) Formal Verification, ensuring all reasoning paths are rule-compliant; 3) Connection Thinking, bridging formal deduction with human-like logical steps; and 4) our \textit{GeoExplore} series algorithms, which produce diverse problem variants with multiple solutions and self-reflective backtracking. Using this engine, we create the GeoTrust-200K dataset and the corresponding GeoTrust-test benchmark, both with guaranteed cross-modal integrity. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art models achieve only 45.83\% accuracy on GeoTrust-test, highlighting its significant challenge. Furthermore, training on our synthesized data substantially improves model performance on GPS tasks, with strong generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) benchmarks.

  Deriving personalized insights from popular wearable trackers requires complex numerical reasoning that challenges standard LLMs, necessitating tool-based approaches like code generation. Large language model (LLM) agents present a promising yet largely untapped solution for this analysis at scale. We introduce the Personal Health Insights Agent (PHIA), a system leveraging multistep reasoning with code generation and information retrieval to analyze and interpret behavioral health data. To test its capabilities, we create and share two benchmark datasets with over 4000 health insights questions. A 650-hour human expert evaluation shows that PHIA significantly outperforms a strong code generation baseline, achieving 84% accuracy on objective, numerical questions and, for open-ended ones, earning 83% favorable ratings while being twice as likely to achieve the highest quality rating. This work can advance behavioral health by empowering individuals to understand their data, enabling a new era of accessible, personalized, and data-driven wellness for the wider population.

  _Farhad Abtahi, Mehdi Astaraki, Fernando Seoane_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical AI systems.

  _Saravanan Venkatachalam_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive, explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries, contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents, RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction, configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time decision-making.

  Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights for healthcare applications.

  Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure, Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts, signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20 rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

This article will attempt to analyze the opportunities and challenges of AI from several different perspectives using a structured approach. This article proposes a seven-layer model for AI compute architecture, including Physical Layer, Link Layer, Neural Network Layer, Context Layer, Agent Layer, Orchestrator Layer, and Application Layer, from bottom to top. It also explains how AI computing has evolved into this 7-layer architecture through the three-stage evolution on large-scale language models (LLMs). For each layer, we describe the development trajectory and key technologies. In Layers 1 and 2 we discuss AI computing issues and the impact of Scale-Up and Scale-Out strategies on computing architecture. In Layer 3 we explore two different development paths for LLMs. In Layer 4 we discuss the impact of contextual memory on LLMs and compares it to traditional processor memory. In Layers 5 to 7 we discuss the trends of AI agents and explore the issues in evolution from a single AI agent to an AI-based ecosystem, and their impact on the AI industry. Furthermore, AI development involves not only technical challenges but also the economic issues to build self-sustainable ecosystem.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

  In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations, limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

  Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs. However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG, making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their design.

  Knowledge Graph based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Model (LLM) inference in tasks like Question Answering (QA) by retrieving relevant information from knowledge graphs (KGs). However, real-world KGs are often incomplete, meaning that essential information for answering questions may be missing. Existing benchmarks do not adequately capture the impact of KG incompleteness on KG-RAG performance. In this paper, we systematically evaluate KG-RAG methods under incomplete KGs by removing triples using different methods and analyzing the resulting effects. We demonstrate that KG-RAG methods are sensitive to KG incompleteness, highlighting the need for more robust approaches in realistic settings.
