- **[Plan-R1: Safe and Feasible Trajectory Planning as Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17659)**  `arXiv:2505.17659`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`  
  _Xiaolong Tang, Meina Kan, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safe and feasible trajectory planning is essential for real-world autonomous driving systems. However, existing learning-based planning methods often rely on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting unsafe behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a novel two-stage trajectory planning framework that formulates trajectory planning as a sequential prediction task, guided by explicit planning principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. In the first stage, we train an autoregressive trajectory predictor via next motion token prediction on expert data. In the second stage, we design rule-based rewards (e.g., collision avoidance, speed limits) and fine-tune the model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning strategy, to align its predictions with these planning principles. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that our Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in autonomous driving research towards motion planners that are robust, safe, and adaptive. However, existing rule-based and data-driven planners lack adaptability to long-tail scenarios, while knowledge-driven methods offer strong reasoning but face challenges in representation, control, and real-world evaluation. To address these challenges, we present LiloDriver, a lifelong learning framework for closed-loop motion planning in long-tail autonomous driving scenarios. By integrating large language models (LLMs) with a memory-augmented planner generation system, LiloDriver continuously adapts to new scenarios without retraining. It features a four-stage architecture including perception, scene encoding, memory-based strategy refinement, and LLM-guided reasoning. Evaluated on the nuPlan benchmark, LiloDriver achieves superior performance in both common and rare driving scenarios, outperforming static rule-based and learning-based planners. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining structured memory and LLM reasoning to enable scalable, human-like motion planning in real-world autonomous driving.

- **[How Secure Are Large Language Models (LLMs) for Navigation in Urban Environments?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09546)**  `arXiv:2402.09546`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  In the field of robotics and automation, navigation systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive performance. However, the security aspects of these systems have received relatively less attention. This paper pioneers the exploration of vulnerabilities in LLM-based navigation models in urban outdoor environments, a critical area given the widespread application of this technology in autonomous driving, logistics, and emergency services. Specifically, we introduce a novel Navigational Prompt Attack that manipulates LLM-based navigation models by perturbing the original navigational prompt, leading to incorrect actions. Based on the method of perturbation, our attacks are divided into two types: Navigational Prompt Insert (NPI) Attack and Navigational Prompt Swap (NPS) Attack. We conducted comprehensive experiments on an LLM-based navigation model that employs various LLMs for reasoning. Our results, derived from the Touchdown and Map2Seq street-view datasets under both few-shot learning and fine-tuning configurations, demonstrate notable performance declines across seven metrics in the face of both white-box and black-box attacks. Moreover, our attacks can be easily extended to other LLM-based navigation models with similarly effective results. These findings highlight the generalizability and transferability of the proposed attack, emphasizing the need for enhanced security in LLM-based navigation systems. As an initial countermeasure, we propose the Navigational Prompt Engineering (NPE) Defense strategy, which concentrates on navigation-relevant keywords to reduce the impact of adversarial attacks. While initial findings indicate that this strategy enhances navigational safety, there remains a critical need for the wider research community to develop stronger defense methods to effectively tackle the real-world challenges faced by these systems.

- **[ScanBot: Towards Intelligent Surface Scanning in Embodied Robotic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17295)**  `arXiv:2505.17295`  `cs.RO`  
  _Zhiling Chen, Yang Zhang, Fardin Jalil Piran, Qianyu Zhou, Jiong Tang, Farhad Imani_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce ScanBot, a novel dataset designed for instruction-conditioned, high-precision surface scanning in robotic systems. In contrast to existing robot learning datasets that focus on coarse tasks such as grasping, navigation, or dialogue, ScanBot targets the high-precision demands of industrial laser scanning, where sub-millimeter path continuity and parameter stability are critical. The dataset covers laser scanning trajectories executed by a robot across 12 diverse objects and 6 task types, including full-surface scans, geometry-focused regions, spatially referenced parts, functionally relevant structures, defect inspection, and comparative analysis. Each scan is guided by natural language instructions and paired with synchronized RGB, depth, and laser profiles, as well as robot pose and joint states. Despite recent progress, existing vision-language action (VLA) models still fail to generate stable scanning trajectories under fine-grained instructions and real-world precision demands. To investigate this limitation, we benchmark a range of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across the full perception-planning-execution loop, revealing persistent challenges in instruction-following under realistic constraints.

- **[Swarm Intelligence Enhanced Reasoning: A Density-Driven Framework for LLM-Based Multi-Agent Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17115)**  `arXiv:2505.17115`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, many approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Multi-Agent Debate (MAD), have been proposed to further enrich Large Language Models' (LLMs) complex problem-solving capacities in reasoning scenarios. However, these methods may fail to solve complex problems due to the lack of ability to find optimal solutions. Swarm Intelligence has been serving as a powerful tool for finding optima in the field of traditional optimization problems. To this end, we propose integrating swarm intelligence into the reasoning process by introducing a novel Agent-based Swarm Intelligence (ASI) paradigm. In this paradigm, we formulate LLM reasoning as an optimization problem and use a swarm intelligence scheme to guide a group of LLM-based agents in collaboratively searching for optimal solutions. To avoid swarm intelligence getting trapped in local optima, we further develop a Swarm Intelligence Enhancing Reasoning (SIER) framework, which develops a density-driven strategy to enhance the reasoning ability. To be specific, we propose to perform kernel density estimation and non-dominated sorting to optimize both solution quality and diversity simultaneously. In this case, SIER efficiently enhances solution space exploration through expanding the diversity of the reasoning path. Besides, a step-level quality evaluation is used to help agents improve solution quality by correcting low-quality intermediate steps. Then, we use quality thresholds to dynamically control the termination of exploration and the selection of candidate steps, enabling a more flexible and efficient reasoning process. Extensive experiments are ...

- **[Get Experience from Practice: LLM Agents with Record & Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17716)**  `arXiv:2505.17716`  `cs.LG` `cs.MA`

  AI agents, empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and communication protocols such as MCP and A2A, have rapidly evolved from simple chatbots to autonomous entities capable of executing complex, multi-step tasks, demonstrating great potential. However, the LLMs' inherent uncertainty and heavy computational resource requirements pose four significant challenges to the development of safe and efficient agents: reliability, privacy, cost and performance. Existing approaches, like model alignment, workflow constraints and on-device model deployment, can partially alleviate some issues but often with limitations, failing to fundamentally resolve these challenges.This paper proposes a new paradigm called AgentRR (Agent Record & Replay), which introduces the classical record-and-replay mechanism into AI agent frameworks. The core idea is to: 1. Record an agent's interaction trace with its environment and internal decision process during task execution, 2. Summarize this trace into a structured "experience" encapsulating the workflow and constraints, and 3. Replay these experiences in subsequent similar tasks to guide the agent's behavior. We detail a multi-level experience abstraction method and a check function mechanism in AgentRR: the former balances experience specificity and generality, while the latter serves as a trust anchor to ensure completeness and safety during replay. In addition, we explore multiple application modes of AgentRR, including user-recorded task demonstration, large-small model collaboration and privacy-aware agent execution, and envision an experience repository for sharing and reusing knowledge to further reduce deployment cost.

- **[Bridging Supervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning in Math Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18116)**  `arXiv:2505.18116`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Huayu Chen, Kaiwen Zheng, Qinsheng Zhang, Ganqu Cui, Yin Cui, Haotian Ye, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has played a central role in the recent surge of LLMs' math abilities by enabling self-improvement through binary verifier signals. In contrast, Supervised Learning (SL) is rarely considered for such verification-driven training, largely due to its heavy reliance on reference answers and inability to reflect on mistakes. In this work, we challenge the prevailing notion that self-improvement is exclusive to RL and propose Negative-aware Fine-Tuning (NFT) -- a supervised approach that enables LLMs to reflect on their failures and improve autonomously with no external teachers. In online training, instead of throwing away self-generated negative answers, NFT constructs an implicit negative policy to model them. This implicit policy is parameterized with the same positive LLM we target to optimize on positive data, enabling direct policy optimization on all LLMs' generations. We conduct experiments on 7B and 32B models in math reasoning tasks. Results consistently show that through the additional leverage of negative feedback, NFT significantly improves over SL baselines like Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning, matching or even surpassing leading RL algorithms like GRPO and DAPO. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NFT and GRPO are actually equivalent in strict-on-policy training, even though they originate from entirely different theoretical foundations. Our experiments and theoretical findings bridge the gap between SL and RL methods in binary-feedback learning systems.

- **[Towards Analyzing and Understanding the Limitations of VAPO: A Theoretical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17997)**  `arXiv:2505.17997`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Jintian Shao, Yiming Cheng, Hongyi Huang, Beiwen Zhang, Zhiyu Wu, You Shan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The VAPO framework has demonstrated significant empirical success in enhancing the efficiency and reliability of reinforcement learning for long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tasks with large language models (LLMs). By systematically addressing challenges such as value model bias, heterogeneous sequence lengths, and sparse reward signals, VAPO achieves state-of-the-art performance. While its practical benefits are evident, a deeper theoretical understanding of its underlying mechanisms and potential limitations is crucial for guiding future advancements. This paper aims to initiate such a discussion by exploring VAPO from a theoretical perspective, highlighting areas where its assumptions might be challenged and where further investigation could yield more robust and generalizable reasoning agents. We delve into the intricacies of value function approximation in complex reasoning spaces, the optimality of adaptive advantage estimation, the impact of token-level optimization, and the enduring challenges of exploration and generalization.

- **[NeUQI: Near-Optimal Uniform Quantization Parameter Initialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17595)**  `arXiv:2505.17595`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Li Lin, Xinyu Hu, Xiaojun Wan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across domains but face significant challenges when deployed on consumer-grade GPUs or personal devices such as laptops, due to high memory consumption and inference costs. Post-training quantization (PTQ) of LLMs offers a promising solution that reduces their memory footprint and decoding latency. In practice, PTQ with uniform quantization representation is favored for its efficiency and ease of deployment since uniform quantization is widely supported by mainstream hardware and software libraries. Recent studies on $\geq 2$-bit uniform quantization have led to noticeable improvements in post-quantization model performance; however, they primarily focus on quantization methodologies, while the initialization of quantization parameters is underexplored and still relies on the suboptimal Min-Max strategies. In this work, we propose NeUQI, a method devoted to efficiently determining near-optimal initial parameters for uniform quantization. NeUQI is orthogonal to prior quantization methodologies and can seamlessly integrate with them. The experiments with the LLaMA and Qwen families on various tasks demonstrate that our NeUQI consistently outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, when combined with a lightweight distillation strategy, NeUQI can achieve superior performance to PV-tuning, a much more resource-intensive approach.

- **[Self-Training Large Language Models with Confident Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17454)**  `arXiv:2505.17454`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Hyosoon Jang, Yunhui Jang, Sungjae Lee, Jungseul Ok, Sungsoo Ahn_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance by generating reasoning paths before final answers, but learning such a reasoning path requires costly human supervision. To address this issue, recent studies have explored self-training methods that improve reasoning capabilities using pseudo-labels generated by the LLMs themselves. Among these, confidence-based self-training fine-tunes LLMs to prefer reasoning paths with high-confidence answers, where confidence is estimated via majority voting. However, such methods exclusively focus on the quality of the final answer and may ignore the quality of the reasoning paths, as even an incorrect reasoning path leads to a correct answer by chance. Instead, we advocate the use of reasoning-level confidence to identify high-quality reasoning paths for self-training, supported by our empirical observations. We then propose a new self-training method, CORE-PO, that fine-tunes LLMs to prefer high-COnfidence REasoning paths through Policy Optimization. Our experiments show that CORE-PO improves the accuracy of outputs on four in-distribution and two out-of-distribution benchmarks, compared to existing self-training methods.

  _Maryam Dialameh, Rezaul Karim, Hossein Rajabzadeh, Omar Mohamed Awad, Hyock Ju Kwon, Boxing Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces ECHO-LLaMA, an efficient LLaMA architecture designed to improve both the training speed and inference throughput of LLaMA architectures while maintaining its learning capacity. ECHO-LLaMA transforms LLaMA models into shared KV caching across certain layers, significantly reducing KV computational complexity while maintaining or improving language performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ECHO-LLaMA achieves up to 77\% higher token-per-second throughput during training, up to 16\% higher Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU), and up to 14\% lower loss when trained on an equal number of tokens. Furthermore, on the 1.1B model, ECHO-LLaMA delivers approximately 7\% higher test-time throughput compared to the baseline. By introducing a computationally efficient adaptation mechanism, ECHO-LLaMA offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for pretraining and finetuning large language models, enabling faster and more resource-efficient training without compromising performance.

- **[Zebra-Llama: Towards Extremely Efficient Hybrid Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17272)**  `arXiv:2505.17272`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Mingyu Yang, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Guihong Li, Vikram Appia, Emad Barsoum_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the growing demand for deploying large language models (LLMs) across diverse applications, improving their inference efficiency is crucial for sustainable and democratized access. However, retraining LLMs to meet new user-specific requirements is prohibitively expensive and environmentally unsustainable. In this work, we propose a practical and scalable alternative: composing efficient hybrid language models from existing pre-trained models. Our approach, Zebra-Llama, introduces a family of 1B, 3B, and 8B hybrid models by combining State Space Models (SSMs) and Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) layers, using a refined initialization and post-training pipeline to efficiently transfer knowledge from pre-trained Transformers. Zebra-Llama achieves Transformer-level accuracy with near-SSM efficiency using only 7-11B training tokens (compared to trillions of tokens required for pre-training) and an 8B teacher. Moreover, Zebra-Llama dramatically reduces KV cache size -down to 3.9%, 2%, and 2.73% of the original for the 1B, 3B, and 8B variants, respectively-while preserving 100%, 100%, and >97% of average zero-shot performance on LM Harness tasks. Compared to models like MambaInLLaMA, X-EcoMLA, Minitron, and Llamba, Zebra-Llama consistently delivers competitive or superior accuracy while using significantly fewer tokens, smaller teachers, and vastly reduced KV cache memory. Notably, Zebra-Llama-8B surpasses Minitron-8B in few-shot accuracy by 7% while using 8x fewer training tokens, over 12x smaller KV cache, and a smaller teacher (8B vs. 15B). It also achieves 2.6x-3.8x higher throughput (tokens/s) than MambaInLlama up to a 32k context length. We will release code and model checkpoints upon acceptance.

- **[Generalizing Large Language Model Usability Across Resource-Constrained](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17040)**  `arXiv:2505.17040`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Yun-Da Tsai_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of natural language tasks, and recent efforts have sought to extend their capabilities to multimodal domains and resource-constrained environments. However, existing approaches often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning or assume fixed training conditions, limiting their generalization when facing unseen modalities, limited data, or restricted compute resources. This dissertation presents a systematic study toward generalizing LLM usability under real-world constraints. First, it introduces a robust text-centric alignment framework that enables LLMs to seamlessly integrate diverse modalities-including text, images, tables, and any modalities - via natural language interfaces. This approach supports in-context adaptation to unseen or dynamically changing modalities without requiring retraining. To enhance robustness against noisy and missing modalities, an adversarial prompting technique is proposed, generating semantically challenging perturbations at the prompt level to stress-test model reliability. Beyond multimodal setting, the dissertation investigates inference-time optimization strategies for LLMs, leveraging prompt search and uncertainty quantification to improve performance without additional model training. This perspective offers an efficient alternative to scaling model parameters or retraining from scratch. Additionally, the work addresses low-resource domains such as Verilog code generation by designing correct-by-construction synthetic data pipelines and logic-enhanced reasoning models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal data. Together, these contributions form a unified effort to enhance the adaptability, scalability, and efficiency of large language models under practical constraints.

- **[Hogwild! Inference: Parallel LLM Generation via Concurrent Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06261)**  `arXiv:2504.06261`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Gleb Rodionov, Roman Garipov, Alina Shutova, George Yakushev, Erik Schultheis, Vage Egiazarian, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content generation, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long inference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to expedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks, exploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown that LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation frameworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks may not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their applicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM "workers" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated attention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our approach allows the LLM instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy for the problem at hand, all the while "seeing" each other's memory in the concurrent KV cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in parallel with the same attention cache, with "instant" access to each other's memory. Hogwild! Inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization. We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning.

  _Benjamin Feuer, Chinmay Hegde_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language model (LLM) post-training, from DPO to distillation, can refine behaviors and unlock new skills, but the open science supporting these post-training techniques is still in its infancy. One limiting factor has been the difficulty of conducting large-scale comparative analyses of synthetic data generating models and LLM judges. To close this gap, we introduce WILDCHAT-50M, the largest public chat dataset to date. We extend the existing WildChat dataset to include responses not only from GPT, but from over 50 different open-weight models, ranging in size from 0.5B to 104B parameters. We conduct an extensive comparative analysis and demonstrate the potential of this dataset by creating RE-WILD, our own public SFT mix, which outperforms the recent Tulu-3 SFT mixture from Allen AI with only 40% as many samples. Our dataset, samples and code are available atthis https URL.

- **[Optimizing Large Language Model Training Using FP4 Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17116)**  `arXiv:2501.17116`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Ruizhe Wang, Yeyun Gong, Xiao Liu, Guoshuai Zhao, Ziyue Yang, Baining Guo, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing computational demands of training large language models (LLMs) necessitate more efficient methods. Quantized training presents a promising solution by enabling low-bit arithmetic operations to reduce these costs. While FP8 precision has demonstrated feasibility, leveraging FP4 remains a challenge due to significant quantization errors and limited representational capacity. This work introduces the first FP4 training framework for LLMs, addressing these challenges with two key innovations: a differentiable quantization estimator for precise weight updates and an outlier clamping and compensation strategy to prevent activation collapse. To ensure stability, the framework integrates a mixed-precision training scheme and vector-wise quantization. Experimental results demonstrate that our FP4 framework achieves accuracy comparable to BF16 and FP8, with minimal degradation, scaling effectively to 13B-parameter LLMs trained on up to 100B tokens. With the emergence of next-generation hardware supporting FP4, our framework sets a foundation for efficient ultra-low precision training.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly important, as it eliminates reliance on network connections, reduces expensive API calls, and enhances user privacy. However, on-device deployment is challenging due to the limited computational resources of edge devices. In particular, the key bottleneck stems from memory bandwidth constraints related to weight loading. Weight-only quantization effectively reduces memory access, yet often induces significant accuracy degradation. Recent efforts to incorporate sub-branches have shown promise for mitigating quantization errors, but these methods either lack robust optimization strategies or rely on suboptimal objectives. To address these gaps, we propose FeedBack Quantization (FBQuant), a novel approach inspired by negative feedback mechanisms in automatic control. FBQuant inherently ensures that the reconstructed weights remain bounded by the quantization process, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. To further offset the additional latency introduced by sub-branches, we develop an efficient CUDA kernel that decreases 60% of extra inference time. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of FBQuant across various LLMs. Notably, for 3-bit Llama2-7B, FBQuant improves zero-shot accuracy by 1.2%.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in multimodal slow-thinking systems have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse visual reasoning tasks. However, their capabilities in text-rich image reasoning tasks remain understudied due to the lack of a systematic benchmark. To address this gap, we propose OCR-Reasoning, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess Multimodal Large Language Models on text-rich image reasoning tasks. The benchmark comprises 1,069 human-annotated examples spanning 6 core reasoning abilities and 18 practical reasoning tasks in text-rich visual scenarios. Furthermore, unlike other text-rich image understanding benchmarks that only annotate the final answers, OCR-Reasoning also annotates the reasoning process simultaneously. With the annotated reasoning process and the final answers, OCR-Reasoning evaluates not only the final answers generated by models but also their reasoning processes, enabling a holistic analysis of their problem-solving abilities. Leveraging this benchmark, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our results demonstrate the limitations of existing methodologies. Notably, even state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit substantial difficulties, with none achieving accuracy surpassing 50\% across OCR-Reasoning, indicating that the challenges of text-rich image reasoning are an urgent issue to be addressed. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are available atthis https URL.

- **[Reward Model Overoptimisation in Iterated RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18126)**  `arXiv:2505.18126`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Lorenz Wolf, Robert Kirk, Mirco Musolesi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a widely used method for aligning large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often suffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the reward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the idiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is iterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated human feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption, the dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in iterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model training data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used for optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled AlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over successive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth preferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while reinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation flexibility. Other initialisation strategies often fail to recover from early overoptimisation. These findings offer actionable insights for building more stable and generalisable RLHF pipelines.

- **[Data Mixing Can Induce Phase Transitions in Knowledge Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18091)**  `arXiv:2505.18091`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained on data mixtures: most data come from web scrapes, while a small portion is curated from high-quality sources with dense domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we show that when training LLMs on such data mixtures, knowledge acquisition from knowledge-dense datasets, unlike training exclusively on knowledge-dense data (arXiv:2404.05405), does not always follow a smooth scaling law but can exhibit phase transitions with respect to the mixing ratio and model size. Through controlled experiments on a synthetic biography dataset mixed with web-scraped data, we demonstrate that: (1) as we increase the model size to a critical value, the model suddenly transitions from memorizing very few to most of the biographies; (2) below a critical mixing ratio, the model memorizes almost nothing even with extensive training, but beyond this threshold, it rapidly memorizes more biographies. We attribute these phase transitions to a capacity allocation phenomenon: a model with bounded capacity must act like a knapsack problem solver to minimize the overall test loss, and the optimal allocation across datasets can change discontinuously as the model size or mixing ratio varies. We formalize this intuition in an information-theoretic framework and reveal that these phase transitions are predictable, with the critical mixing ratio following a power-law relationship with the model size. Our findings highlight a concrete case where a good mixing recipe for large models may not be optimal for small models, and vice versa.

  Using AI to create autonomous researchers has the potential to accelerate scientific discovery. A prerequisite for this vision is understanding how well an AI model can identify the underlying structure of a black-box system from its behavior. In this paper, we explore how well a large language model (LLM) learns to identify a black-box function from passively observed versus actively collected data. We investigate the reverse-engineering capabilities of LLMs across three distinct types of black-box systems, each chosen to represent different problem domains where future autonomous AI researchers may have considerable impact: Program, Formal Language, and Math Equation. Through extensive experiments, we show that LLMs fail to extract information from observations, reaching a performance plateau that falls short of the ideal of Bayesian inference. However, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to not only observe but also intervene -- actively querying the black-box with specific inputs to observe the resulting output -- improves performance by allowing LLMs to test edge cases and refine their beliefs. By providing the intervention data from one LLM to another, we show that this improvement is partly a result of engaging in the process of generating effective interventions, paralleling results in the literature on human learning. Further analysis reveals that engaging in intervention can help LLMs escape from two common failure modes: overcomplication, where the LLM falsely assumes prior knowledge about the black-box, and overlooking, where the LLM fails to incorporate observations. These insights provide practical guidance for helping LLMs more effectively reverse-engineer black-box systems, supporting their use in making new discoveries.

  The growing size of large language models has created significant computational inefficiencies. To address this challenge, sparse activation methods selectively deactivates non-essential parameters during inference, reducing computational costs in FFNN layers. While existing methods focus on non-linear gating mechanisms, we hypothesize that the sparsity of the FFNN layer lies globally in the form of a linear combination over its internal down projection matrix. Based on this insight, we propose two methods: M-COUNTDOWN, leveraging indirect coefficients, and D-COUNTDOWN, utilizing direct coefficients of the linear combination. Experimental results demonstrate that D-COUNTDOWN can omit 90% of computations with performance loss as low as 5.5% ideally, while M-COUNTDOWN provides a predictor-free solution with up to 29.4% better performance preservation compared to existing methods. Our specialized kernel implementations effectively realize these theoretical gains into substantial real-world acceleration.

  Various AI safety datasets have been developed to measure LLMs against evolving interpretations of harm. Our evaluation of five recently published open-source safety benchmarks reveals distinct semantic clusters using UMAP dimensionality reduction and kmeans clustering (silhouette score: 0.470). We identify six primary harm categories with varying benchmark representation. GretelAI, for example, focuses heavily on privacy concerns, while WildGuardMix emphasizes self-harm scenarios. Significant differences in prompt length distribution suggests confounds to data collection and interpretations of harm as well as offer possible context. Our analysis quantifies benchmark orthogonality among AI benchmarks, allowing for transparency in coverage gaps despite topical similarities. Our quantitative framework for analyzing semantic orthogonality across safety benchmarks enables more targeted development of datasets that comprehensively address the evolving landscape of harms in AI use, however that is defined in the future.

  Policy gradient algorithms have been successfully applied to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the widespread use of Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization in policy gradient algorithms to stabilize training, the systematic exploration of how different KL divergence formulations can be estimated and integrated into surrogate loss functions for online reinforcement learning (RL) presents a nuanced and systematically explorable design space. In this paper, we propose regularized policy gradient (RPG), a systematic framework for deriving and analyzing KL-regularized policy gradient methods in the online RL setting. We derive policy gradients and corresponding surrogate loss functions for objectives regularized by both forward and reverse KL divergences, considering both normalized and unnormalized policy distributions. Furthermore, we present derivations for fully differentiable loss functions as well as REINFORCE-style gradient estimators, accommodating diverse algorithmic needs. We conduct extensive experiments on RL for LLM reasoning using these methods, showing improved or competitive results in terms of training stability and performance compared to strong baselines such as GRPO, REINFORCE++, and DAPO.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance by capturing complex interactions between input features. To identify these interactions, most existing approaches require enumerating all possible combinations of features up to a given order, causing them to scale poorly with the number of inputs $n$. Recently, Kang et al. (2025) proposed SPEX, an information-theoretic approach that uses interaction sparsity to scale to $n \approx 10^3$ features. SPEX greatly improves upon prior methods but requires tens of thousands of model inferences, which can be prohibitive for large models. In this paper, we observe that LLM feature interactions are often hierarchical -- higher-order interactions are accompanied by their lower-order subsets -- which enables more efficient discovery. To exploit this hierarchy, we propose ProxySPEX, an interaction attribution algorithm that first fits gradient boosted trees to masked LLM outputs and then extracts the important interactions. Experiments across four challenging high-dimensional datasets show that ProxySPEX more faithfully reconstructs LLM outputs by 20% over marginal attribution approaches while using $10\times$ fewer inferences than SPEX. By accounting for interactions, ProxySPEX identifies features that influence model output over 20% more than those selected by marginal approaches. Further, we apply ProxySPEX to two interpretability tasks. Data attribution, where we identify interactions among CIFAR-10 training samples that influence test predictions, and mechanistic interpretability, where we uncover interactions between attention heads, both within and across layers, on a question-answering task. ProxySPEX identifies interactions that enable more aggressive pruning of heads than marginal approaches.

  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate exceptional capability in tackling complex mathematical, logical, and coding tasks by leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Test-time scaling methods, such as prolonging CoT with explicit token-level exploration, can push LRMs' accuracy boundaries, but they incur significant decoding overhead. A key inefficiency source is LRMs often generate redundant thinking CoTs, which demonstrate clear structured overthinking and underthinking patterns. Inspired by human cognitive reasoning processes and numerical optimization theories, we propose TrimR, a verifier-based, training-free, efficient framework for dynamic CoT compression to trim reasoning and enhance test-time scaling, explicitly tailored for production-level deployment. Our method employs a lightweight, pretrained, instruction-tuned verifier to detect and truncate redundant intermediate thoughts of LRMs without any LRM or verifier fine-tuning. We present both the core algorithm and asynchronous online system engineered for high-throughput industrial applications. Empirical evaluations on Ascend NPUs and vLLM show that our framework delivers substantial gains in inference efficiency under large-batch workloads. In particular, on the four MATH500, AIME24, AIME25, and GPQA benchmarks, the reasoning runtime of Pangu-R-38B, QwQ-32B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B is improved by up to 70% with negligible impact on accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Mixture of Experts (MoE) is an effective architecture for scaling large language models by leveraging sparse expert activation to balance performance and efficiency. However, under expert parallelism, MoE suffers from inference inefficiencies due to imbalanced token-to-expert assignment, where underloaded experts complete computations early but must wait for overloaded experts, leading to global delays. We define this phenomenon as the \textbf{\textit{Straggler Effect}}, as the most burdened experts dictate the overall inference latency. To address this, we first propose \textit{\textbf{Capacity-Aware Token Drop}}, which enforces expert capacity limits by discarding excess tokens from overloaded experts, effectively reducing load imbalance with minimal performance impact (e.g., $30\%$ speedup with only $0.9\%$ degradation on OLMoE). Next, given the presence of low-load experts remaining well below the capacity threshold, we introduce \textit{\textbf{Capacity-Aware Expanded Drop}}, which allows tokens to include additional local experts in their candidate set before enforcing strict local capacity constraints, thereby improving load balance and enhancing the utilization of underused experts. Extensive experiments on both language and multimodal MoE models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, yielding substantial gains in expert utilization, model performance, and inference efficiency, e.g., applying Expanded Drop to Mixtral-8$\times$7B-Instruct yields a {0.2\%} average performance improvement and a {1.85$\times$} inference speedup.

  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has boosted math and coding in large language models, yet there has been little effort to extend RLVR into messier, real-world domains like forecasting. One sticking point is that outcome-based reinforcement learning for forecasting must learn from binary, delayed, and noisy rewards, a regime where standard fine-tuning is brittle. We show that outcome-only online RL on a 14B model can match frontier-scale accuracy and surpass it in calibration and hypothetical prediction market betting by adapting two leading algorithms, Group-Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) and ReMax, to the forecasting setting. Our adaptations remove per-question variance scaling in GRPO, apply baseline-subtracted advantages in ReMax, hydrate training with 100k temporally consistent synthetic questions, and introduce lightweight guard-rails that penalise gibberish, non-English responses and missing rationales, enabling a single stable pass over 110k events. Scaling ReMax to 110k questions and ensembling seven predictions yields a 14B model that matches frontier baseline o1 on accuracy on our holdout set (Brier = 0.193, p = 0.23) while beating it in calibration (ECE = 0.042, p < 0.001). A simple trading rule turns this calibration edge into \$127 of hypothetical profit versus \$92 for o1 (p = 0.037). This demonstrates that refined RLVR methods can convert small-scale LLMs into potentially economically valuable forecasting tools, with implications for scaling this to larger models.

  R1-style Reinforcement Learning (RL) significantly enhances Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet the mechanism behind rule-based RL remains unclear. We found that small-scale SFT has significant influence on RL but shows poor efficiency. To explain our observations, we propose an analytical framework and compare the efficiency of SFT and RL by measuring sample effect. Hypothetical analysis show that SFT efficiency is limited by training data. Guided by our analysis, we propose Re-distillation, a technique that fine-tunes pretrain model through small-scale distillation from the RL-trained policy. Experiments on Knight & Knave and MATH datasets demonstrate re-distillation's surprising efficiency: re-distilled models match RL performance with far fewer samples and less computation. Empirical verification shows that sample effect is a good indicator of performance improvements. As a result, on K&K dataset, our re-distilled Qwen2.5-1.5B model surpasses DeepSeek-V3-0324 with only 1K SFT samples. On MATH, Qwen2.5-1.5B fine-tuned with re-distilled 500 samples matches its instruct-tuned variant without RL. Our work explains several interesting phenomena in R1-style RL, shedding light on the mechanisms behind its empirical success. Code is available at:this https URL

  Real world collection of Activities of Daily Living data is challenging due to privacy concerns, costly deployment and labeling, and the inherent sparsity and imbalance of human behavior. We present ADLGen, a generative framework specifically designed to synthesize realistic, event triggered, and symbolic sensor sequences for ambient assistive environments. ADLGen integrates a decoder only Transformer with sign based symbolic temporal encoding, and a context and layout aware sampling mechanism to guide generation toward semantically rich and physically plausible sensor event sequences. To enhance semantic fidelity and correct structural inconsistencies, we further incorporate a large language model into an automatic generate evaluate refine loop, which verifies logical, behavioral, and temporal coherence and generates correction rules without manual intervention or environment specific tuning. Through comprehensive experiments with novel evaluation metrics, ADLGen is shown to outperform baseline generators in statistical fidelity, semantic richness, and downstream activity recognition, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for ADL data synthesis.

  The Fisher information is a fundamental concept for characterizing the sensitivity of parameters in neural networks. However, leveraging the full observed Fisher information is too expensive for large models, so most methods rely on simple diagonal approximations. While efficient, this approach ignores parameter correlations, often resulting in reduced performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we mitigate these limitations and propose Generalized Fisher-Weighted SVD (GFWSVD), a post-training LLM compression technique that accounts for both diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the Fisher information matrix, providing a more accurate reflection of parameter importance. To make the method tractable, we introduce a scalable adaptation of the Kronecker-factored approximation algorithm for the observed Fisher information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on LLM compression, showing improvements over existing compression baselines. For example, at a 20 compression rate on the MMLU benchmark, our method outperforms FWSVD, which is based on a diagonal approximation of the Fisher information, by 5 percent, SVD-LLM by 3 percent, and ASVD by 6 percent compression rate.

  Low-rank optimization has emerged as a promising direction in training large language models (LLMs) to reduce the memory usage of adaptive optimizers by constraining learning to a lower-dimensional space. Prior work typically projects gradients of linear layers using approaches based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). However, applying SVD-based procedures individually to each layer in large models is computationally expensive and incurs additional memory costs due to storing the projection matrices. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient and conceptually simple two-step procedure to approximate SVD-based gradient projections into lower-dimensional spaces. First, we construct a complete orthogonal basis using predefined orthogonal matrices of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Second, we adaptively select basis columns based on their alignment with the gradient of each layer. Each projection matrix in our method is obtained via a single matrix multiplication followed by a lightweight sorting step to identify the most relevant basis vectors. Due to the predefined nature of the orthogonal bases, they are computed once at the start of training. During training, we store only the indices of the selected columns, avoiding the need to store full projection matrices for each layer. Our numerical experiments on both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual strategy in approximating optimal low-rank projections, matching the performance of costly SVD-based methods while achieving faster runtime and reduced memory usage.

  Recent safety evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) show that many models exhibit dishonest behavior, such as sycophancy. However, most honesty benchmarks focus exclusively on factual knowledge or explicitly harmful behavior and rely on external judges, which are often unable to detect less obvious forms of dishonesty. In this work, we introduce a new framework, Judge Using Safety-Steered Alternatives (JUSSA), which utilizes steering vectors trained on a single sample to elicit more honest responses from models, helping LLM-judges in the detection of dishonest behavior. To test our framework, we introduce a new manipulation dataset with prompts specifically designed to elicit deceptive responses. We find that JUSSA enables LLM judges to better differentiate between dishonest and benign responses, and helps them identify subtle instances of manipulative behavior.

  Reinforcement learning exhibits potential in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet it is hard to scale for the low sample efficiency during the rollout phase. Existing methods attempt to improve efficiency by scheduling problems based on problem difficulties. However, these approaches suffer from unstable and biased estimations of problem difficulty and fail to capture the alignment between model competence and problem difficulty in RL training, leading to suboptimal results. To tackle these limitations, this paper introduces \textbf{C}ompetence-\textbf{D}ifficulty \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{S}ampling (\textbf{CDAS}), which enables accurate and stable estimation of problem difficulties by aggregating historical performance discrepancies of problems. Then the model competence is quantified to adaptively select problems whose difficulty is in alignment with the model's current competence using a fixed-point system. Experimental results across a range of challenging mathematical benchmarks show that CDAS achieves great improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. CDAS attains the highest average accuracy against baselines and exhibits significant speed advantages compared to Dynamic Sampling, a competitive strategy in DAPO, which is \textbf{2.33} times slower than CDAS.

  Inference scaling can help LLMs solve complex reasoning problems through extended runtime computation. On top of targeted supervision for long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) generation, purely inference-time techniques such as best-of-N (BoN) sampling, majority voting, or more generally, minimum Bayes risk decoding (MBRD), can further improve LLM accuracy by generating multiple candidate solutions and aggregating over them. These methods typically leverage additional signals in the form of reward models and risk/similarity functions that compare generated samples, e.g., exact match in some normalized space or standard similarity metrics such as Rouge. Here we present a novel method for incorporating reward and risk/similarity signals into MBRD. Based on the concept of optimal policy in KL-controlled reinforcement learning, our framework provides a simple and well-defined mechanism for leveraging such signals, offering several advantages over traditional inference-time methods: higher robustness, improved accuracy, and well-understood asymptotic behavior. In addition, it allows for the development of a sample-efficient variant of MBRD that can adjust the number of samples to generate according to the difficulty of the problem, without relying on majority vote counts. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach on math (MATH-$500$) and coding (HumanEval) tasks using recent open-source models. We also present a comprehensive analysis of its accuracy-compute trade-offs.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding and generation, but their enormous computational and memory requirements hinder deployment. Compression offers a potential solution to mitigate these constraints. However, most existing methods rely on fixed heuristics and thus fail to adapt to runtime memory variations or heterogeneous KV-cache demands arising from diverse user requests. To address these limitations, we propose RAP, an elastic pruning framework driven by reinforcement learning (RL) that dynamically adjusts compression strategies in a runtime-aware manner. Specifically, RAP dynamically tracks the evolving ratio between model parameters and KV-cache across practical execution. Recognizing that FFNs house most parameters, whereas parameter -light attention layers dominate KV-cache formation, the RL agent retains only those components that maximize utility within the current memory budget, conditioned on instantaneous workload and device state. Extensive experiments results demonstrate that RAP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, marking the first time to jointly consider model weights and KV-cache on the fly.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformers have recently gained popularity in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. However, many existing models focus only on capturing temporal dependencies while omitting intricate relationships between variables. Recent models have tried tackling this by explicitly modeling both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies through a sequential or unified attention mechanism, but they are entirely channel dependent (CD) across all layers, making them potentially susceptible to overfitting. To address this, we propose Cross-Variate Patch Embeddings (CVPE), a lightweight CD module that injects cross-variate context into channel-independent (CI) models by simply modifying the patch embedding process. We achieve this by adding a learnable positional encoding and a lightweight router-attention block to the vanilla patch embedding layer. We then integrate CVPE into Time-LLM, a multimodal CI forecasting model, to demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing cross-variate dependencies and enhance the CI model's performance. Extensive experimental results on seven real-world datasets show that our enhanced Time-LLM outperforms the original baseline model simply by incorporating the CVPE module, with no other changes.

  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), an adapter architecture which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We train a set of aLoRA-based intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits. We include a codebase implementing aLoRA in the supplementary material.

  Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress, approaching human perception levels. In this work, we demonstrate that despite these advances, LLMs still struggle to reason using molecular structural information. This gap is critical because many molecular properties, including functional groups, depend heavily on such structural details. To address this limitation, we propose an approach that sketches molecular structures for reasoning. Specifically, we introduce Molecular Structural Reasoning (MSR) framework to enhance the understanding of LLMs by explicitly incorporating the key structural features. We present two frameworks for scenarios where the target molecule is known or unknown. We verify that our MSR improves molecular understanding through extensive experiments.

  External test-time reasoning enhances large language models (LLMs) by decoupling generation and selection. At inference time, the model generates multiple reasoning paths, and an auxiliary process reward model (PRM) is used to score and select the best one. A central challenge in this setting is test-time compute optimality (TCO), i.e., how to maximize answer accuracy under a fixed inference budget. In this work, we establish a theoretical framework to analyze how the generalization error of the PRM affects compute efficiency and reasoning performance. Leveraging PAC-Bayes theory, we derive generalization bounds and show that a lower generalization error of PRM leads to fewer samples required to find correct answers. Motivated by this analysis, we propose Compute-Aware Tree Search (CATS), an actor-critic framework that dynamically controls search behavior. The actor outputs sampling hyperparameters based on reward distributions and sparsity statistics, while the critic estimates their utility to guide budget allocation. Experiments on the MATH and AIME benchmarks with various LLMs and PRMs demonstrate that CATS consistently outperforms other external TTS methods, validating our theoretical predictions.

  Tabular data have been playing a vital role in diverse real-world fields, including healthcare, finance, etc. With the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs), early explorations of extending LLMs to the domain of tabular data have been developed. Most of these LLM-based methods typically first serialize tabular data into natural language descriptions, and then tune LLMs or directly infer on these serialized data. However, these methods suffer from two key inherent issues: (i) data perspective: existing data serialization methods lack universal applicability for structured tabular data, and may pose privacy risks through direct textual exposure, and (ii) model perspective: LLM fine-tuning methods struggle with tabular data, and in-context learning scalability is bottle-necked by input length constraints (suitable for few-shot learning). This work explores a novel direction of integrating LLMs into tabular data throughough logical decision tree rules as intermediaries, proposes a decision tree enhancer with LLM-derived rule for tabular prediction, DeLTa. The proposed DeLTa avoids tabular data serialization, and can be applied to full data learning setting without LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, we leverage the reasoning ability of LLMs to redesign an improved rule given a set of decision tree rules. Furthermore, we provide a calibration method for original decision trees via new generated rule by LLM, which approximates the error correction vector to steer the original decision tree predictions in the direction of ``errors'' reducing. Finally, extensive experiments on diverse tabular benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) represent dynamic facts as timestamped relations between entities. TKG completion involves forecasting missing or future links, requiring models to reason over time-evolving structure. While LLMs show promise for this task, existing approaches often overemphasize supervised fine-tuning and struggle particularly when historical evidence is limited or missing. We introduce RECIPE-TKG, a lightweight and data-efficient framework designed to improve accuracy and generalization in settings with sparse historical context. It combines (1) rule-based multi-hop retrieval for structurally diverse history, (2) contrastive fine-tuning of lightweight adapters to encode relational semantics, and (3) test-time semantic filtering to iteratively refine generations based on embedding similarity. Experiments on four TKG benchmarks show that RECIPE-TKG outperforms previous LLM-based approaches, achieving up to 30.6\% relative improvement in Hits@10. Moreover, our proposed framework produces more semantically coherent predictions, even for the samples with limited historical context.

  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers a cost-effective solution for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), but it often produces overconfident predictions in data-scarce few-shot settings. To address this issue, several classical statistical learning approaches have been repurposed for scalable uncertainty-aware LoRA fine-tuning. However, these approaches neglect how input characteristics affect the predictive uncertainty estimates. To address this limitation, we propose Contextual Low-Rank Adaptation (\textbf{C-LoRA}) as a novel uncertainty-aware and parameter efficient fine-tuning approach, by developing new lightweight LoRA modules contextualized to each input data sample to dynamically adapt uncertainty estimates. Incorporating data-driven contexts into the parameter posteriors, C-LoRA mitigates overfitting, achieves well-calibrated uncertainties, and yields robust predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C-LoRA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art uncertainty-aware LoRA methods in both uncertainty quantification and model generalization. Ablation studies further confirm the critical role of our contextual modules in capturing sample-specific uncertainties. C-LoRA sets a new standard for robust, uncertainty-aware LLM fine-tuning in few-shot regimes.

  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular method for decomposing Large Langage Models (LLM) activations into interpretable latents. However, due to their substantial training cost, most academic research uses open-source SAEs which are only available for a restricted set of models of up to 27B parameters. SAE latents are also learned from a dataset of activations, which means they do not transfer between models. Motivated by relative representation similarity measures, we introduce Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) models, an alternative method for decomposing language model activations. To train an ITDA, we greedily construct a dictionary of language model activations on a dataset of prompts, selecting those activations which were worst approximated by matching pursuit on the existing dictionary. ITDAs can be trained in just 1\% of the time required for SAEs, using 1\% of the data. This allowed us to train ITDAs on Llama-3.1 70B and 405B on a single consumer GPU. ITDAs can achieve similar reconstruction performance to SAEs on some target LLMs, but generally incur a performance penalty. However, ITDA dictionaries enable cross-model comparisons, and a simple Jaccard similarity index on ITDA dictionaries outperforms existing methods like CKA, SVCCA, and relative representation similarity metrics. ITDAs provide a cheap alternative to SAEs where computational resources are limited, or when cross model comparisons are necessary. Code available atthis https URL.

  Prefix-sharing among multiple prompts presents opportunities to combine the operations of the shared prefix, while attention computation in the decode stage, which becomes a critical bottleneck with increasing context lengths, is a memory-intensive process requiring heavy memory access on the key-value (KV) cache of the prefixes. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the potential of prefix-sharing in the attention computation of the decode stage. However, the tree structure of the prefix-sharing mechanism presents significant challenges for attention computation in efficiently processing shared KV cache access patterns while managing complex dependencies and balancing irregular workloads. To address the above challenges, we propose a dedicated attention kernel to combine the memory access of shared prefixes in the decoding stage, namely FlashForge. FlashForge delivers two key innovations: a novel shared-prefix attention kernel that optimizes memory hierarchy and exploits both intra-block and inter-block parallelism, and a comprehensive workload balancing mechanism that efficiently estimates cost, divides tasks, and schedules execution. Experimental results show that FlashForge achieves an average 1.9x speedup and 120.9x memory access reduction compared to the state-of-the-art FlashDecoding kernel regarding attention computation in the decode stage and 3.8x end-to-end time per output token compared to the vLLM.

  Recent studies have revealed that the loss landscape of large language models resembles a basin, within which the models perform nearly identically, and outside of which they lose all their capabilities. In this work, we conduct further studies on the loss landscape of large language models. We discover that pre-training creates a "basic capability" basin, and subsequent fine-tuning creates "specific capability" basins (e.g., math, safety, coding) within the basic capability basin. We further investigate two types of loss landscapes: the most-case landscape (i.e., the landscape along most directions) and the worst-case landscape (i.e., the landscape along the worst direction). We argue that as long as benign fine-tuning remains within the most-case basin, it will not compromise previous capabilities. Similarly, any fine-tuning (including the adversarial one) that stays within the worst-case basin would not compromise previous capabilities. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate that the size of the most-case basin can bound the size of the worst-case basin and the robustness with respect to input perturbations. We also show that, due to the over-parameterization property of current large language models, one can easily enlarge the basins by five times.

  Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures enable scaling large language models (LLMs) to vast parameter counts without a proportional rise in computational costs. However, the significant memory demands of large MoE models hinder their deployment across various computational environments, from cloud servers to consumer devices. This study first demonstrates pronounced task-specific specialization in expert activation patterns within MoE layers. Building on this, we introduce PreMoe, a novel framework that enables efficient deployment of massive MoE models in memory-constrained environments. PreMoe features two main components: probabilistic expert pruning (PEP) and task-adaptive expert retrieval (TAER). PEP employs a new metric, the task-conditioned expected selection score (TCESS), derived from router logits to quantify expert importance for specific tasks, thereby identifying a minimal set of critical experts. TAER leverages these task-specific expert importance profiles for efficient inference. It pre-computes and stores compact expert patterns for diverse tasks. When a user query is received, TAER rapidly identifies the most relevant stored task pattern and reconstructs the model by loading only the small subset of experts crucial for that task. This approach dramatically reduces the memory footprint across all deployment scenarios. DeepSeek-R1 671B maintains 97.2\% accuracy on MATH500 when pruned to 8/128 configuration (50\% expert reduction), and still achieves 72.0\% with aggressive 8/32 pruning (87.5\% expert reduction). Pangu-Ultra-MoE 718B achieves 97.15\% on MATH500 and 81.3\% on AIME24 with 8/128 pruning, while even more aggressive pruning to 4/64 (390GB memory) preserves 96.95\% accuracy on MATH500.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal method for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for multi-step reasoning processes. Specifically, sparse reward signals fail to deliver effective or sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems. Furthermore, such reward structures induce systematic biases that prioritize exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which inherently demand iterative refinement across ipntermediate steps. To address these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a novel method designed to both deliver dense rewards and amplify explorations in the RL-based training paradigm. i-MENTOR introduces three key innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational efficiency; dynamic reward scaling to stabilize exploration and exploitation in large action spaces; and advantage-preserving reward implementation that maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory guidance. Experiments across three public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's effectiveness with a 22.39% improvement on the difficult dataset Countdown-4.

  Large language models (LLMs) have been used in many zero-shot learning problems, with their strong generalization ability. Recently, adopting LLMs in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has drawn increasing attention. However, the adoption of LLMs faces two major challenges: limited information on graph structure and unreliable responses. LLMs struggle with text attributes isolated from the graph topology. Worse still, they yield unreliable predictions due to both information insufficiency and the inherent weakness of LLMs (e.g., hallucination). Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel method named Dynamic Text Bundling Supervision (DENSE) that queries LLMs with bundles of texts to obtain bundle-level labels and uses these labels to supervise graph neural networks. Specifically, we sample a set of bundles, each containing a set of nodes with corresponding texts of close proximity. We then query LLMs with the bundled texts to obtain the label of each bundle. Subsequently, the bundle labels are used to supervise the optimization of graph neural networks, and the bundles are further refined to exclude noisy items. To justify our design, we also provide theoretical analysis of the proposed method. Extensive experiments across ten datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  Accurate estimation of order fulfillment time is critical for e-commerce logistics, yet traditional rule-based approaches often fail to capture the inherent uncertainties in delivery operations. This paper introduces a novel framework for distributional forecasting of order fulfillment time, leveraging Conformal Predictive Systems and Cross Venn-Abers Predictors--model-agnostic techniques that provide rigorous coverage or validity guarantees. The proposed machine learning methods integrate granular spatiotemporal features, capturing fulfillment location and carrier performance dynamics to enhance predictive accuracy. Additionally, a cost-sensitive decision rule is developed to convert probabilistic forecasts into reliable point predictions. Experimental evaluation on a large-scale industrial dataset demonstrates that the proposed methods generate competitive distributional forecasts, while machine learning-based point predictions significantly outperform the existing rule-based system--achieving up to 14% higher prediction accuracy and up to 75% improvement in identifying late deliveries.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Finetuning large language models (LLMs) enables user-specific customization but introduces critical safety risks: even a few harmful examples can compromise safety alignment. A common mitigation strategy is to update the model more strongly on examples deemed safe, while downweighting or excluding those flagged as unsafe. However, because safety context can shift within a single example, updating the model equally on both harmful and harmless parts of a response is suboptimal-a coarse treatment we term static safety shaping. In contrast, we propose dynamic safety shaping (DSS), a framework that uses fine-grained safety signals to reinforce learning from safe segments of a response while suppressing unsafe content. To enable such fine-grained control during finetuning, we introduce a key insight: guardrail models, traditionally used for filtering, can be repurposed to evaluate partial responses, tracking how safety risk evolves throughout the response, segment by segment. This leads to the Safety Trajectory Assessment of Response (STAR), a token-level signal that enables shaping to operate dynamically over the training sequence. Building on this, we present STAR-DSS, guided by STAR scores, that robustly mitigates finetuning risks and delivers substantial safety improvements across diverse threats, datasets, and model families-all without compromising capability on intended tasks. We encourage future safety research to build on dynamic shaping principles for stronger mitigation against evolving finetuning risks.

  Mechanistic interpretability of large language models (LLMs) aims to uncover the internal processes of information propagation and reasoning. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have demonstrated promise in this domain by extracting interpretable and monosemantic features. However, prior works primarily focus on feature extraction from a single layer, failing to effectively capture activations that span multiple layers. In this paper, we introduce Route Sparse Autoencoder (RouteSAE), a new framework that integrates a routing mechanism with a shared SAE to efficiently extract features from multiple layers. It dynamically assigns weights to activations from different layers, incurring minimal parameter overhead while achieving high interpretability and flexibility for targeted feature manipulation. We evaluate RouteSAE through extensive experiments on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. Specifically, under the same sparsity constraint of 64, RouteSAE extracts 22.5% more features than baseline SAEs while achieving a 22.3% higher interpretability score. These results underscore the potential of RouteSAE as a scalable and effective method for LLM interpretability, with applications in feature discovery and model intervention.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced significant advancements to the capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in recent years. However, as these models continue to scale in size, memory constraints pose substantial challenge. Key and Value cache (KV cache) quantization has been well-documented as a promising solution to this limitation. In this work, we provide two novel theorems aimed at enhancing KV quantization methods. Our first theorem, termed Key-Value Norm Disparity, states that the key weight matrices by nature carry richer information compared to the value weight matrices, as evidenced by higher spectral and Frobenius norms across most of the layers. Our second theorem, Key-Driven Quantization, posits that prioritizing the quantization precision of keys over values induces significant improvements to the overall quantization performance. In particular, assigning greater precision to the keys compared to the values achieves a higher degree of precision reduction with minimal impact on model accuracy. We validate these theorems through theory and extensive experiments on several state-of-the-art LLM architectures and benchmarks. These findings offer valuable guidelines for improving KV cache quantization strategies, facilitating more efficient memory utilization without compromising model performance across diverse NLP tasks.

  Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has emerged as a promising alternative to gradient-based backpropagation methods, particularly for black-box optimization and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning. However, ZO methods often suffer from slow convergence due to high-variance stochastic gradient estimators. While subspace perturbations, such as sparsity and low-rank constraints, have been explored to mitigate this issue, their effectiveness remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a \emph{unified theoretical framework} that analyzes both the convergence and generalization properties of ZO optimization under subspace perturbations. We show that high dimensionality is the primary bottleneck and introduce the notion of \textit{subspace alignment} to explain how the subspace perturbations reduce gradient noise and accelerate convergence. Our analysis further shows that a broad class of subspace perturbations exhibits a similar convergence rate, motivating us to prioritize practical considerations in real-world algorithm design. Building on these insights, we propose an efficient ZO method using block coordinate descent (MeZO-BCD), which perturbs and updates only a subset of parameters at each step. Extensive experiments show that MeZO-BCD significantly accelerates optimization, achieving up to $\mathbf{\times2.77}$ speedup in wall-clock time over MeZO on OPT-13B, while maintaining comparable iteration complexity and fine-tuning performance.

  Numerous real-world decisions rely on machine learning algorithms and require calibrated uncertainty estimates. However, modern methods often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The dominant approach to quantifying the uncertainty inherent in the model is to train an ensemble of separate predictors and measure their empirical variance. In an explicit implementation, the ensemble has high computational cost and memory footprint, especially if the base model itself is already large, like modern transformers. This motivates efforts to develop implicit ensemble methods that emulate the ensemble without explicitly instantiating all its members. We introduce LoRA-Ensemble, a parameter-efficient ensembling method for self-attention networks. It is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), originally developed for efficient LLM fine-tuning, and extends it into an implicit ensembling scheme, where all ensemble members share the same, pre-trained self-attention network, but have individual low-rank matrices for the attention projections. The resulting method not only outperforms state-of-the-art implicit techniques like BatchEnsemble, but even matches or exceeds the accuracy of an Explicit Ensemble, while at the same time achieving superior calibration.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on tasks such as visual question answering, but it remains unclear whether their reasoning relies more on memorized world knowledge or on the visual information present in the input image. To investigate this, we introduce Visual CounterFact, a new dataset of visually-realistic counterfactuals that put world knowledge priors (e.g, red strawberry) into direct conflict with visual input (e.g, blue strawberry). Using Visual CounterFact, we show that model predictions initially reflect memorized priors, but shift toward visual evidence in mid-to-late layers. This dynamic reveals a competition between the two modalities, with visual input ultimately overriding priors during evaluation. To control this behavior, we propose Pixels Versus Priors (PvP) steering vectors, a mechanism for controlling model outputs toward either world knowledge or visual input through activation-level interventions. On average, PvP successfully shifts 92.5% of color and 74.6% of size predictions from priors to counterfactuals. Together, these findings offer new tools for interpreting and controlling factual behavior in multimodal models.

  Charts play a critical role in data analysis and visualization, yet real-world applications often present charts with challenging or noisy features. However, "outlier charts" pose a substantial challenge even for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which can struggle to interpret perturbed charts. In this work, we introduce CHAOS (CHart Analysis with Outlier Samples), a robustness benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs against chart perturbations. CHAOS encompasses five types of textual and ten types of visual perturbations, each presented at three levels of severity (easy, mid, hard) inspired by the study result of human evaluation. The benchmark includes 13 state-of-the-art MLLMs divided into three groups (i.e., general-, document-, and chart-specific models) according to the training scope and data. Comprehensive analysis involves two downstream tasks (ChartQA and Chart-to-Text). Extensive experiments and case studies highlight critical insights into robustness of models across chart perturbations, aiming to guide future research in chart understanding domain.

  Achieving better alignment between vision embeddings and Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing the abilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly for recent models that rely on powerful pretrained vision encoders and LLMs. A common approach to connect the pretrained vision encoder and LLM is through a projector applied after the vision encoder. However, the projector is often trained to enable the LLM to generate captions, and hence the mechanism by which LLMs understand each vision token remains unclear. In this work, we first investigate the role of the projector in compressing vision embeddings and aligning them with word embeddings. We show that the projector significantly compresses visual information, removing redundant details while preserving essential elements necessary for the LLM to understand visual content. We then examine patch-level alignment -- the alignment between each vision patch and its corresponding semantic words -- and propose a *multi-semantic alignment hypothesis*. Our analysis indicates that the projector trained by caption loss improves patch-level alignment but only to a limited extent, resulting in weak and coarse alignment. To address this issue, we propose *patch-aligned training* to efficiently enhance patch-level alignment. Our experiments show that patch-aligned training (1) achieves stronger compression capability and improved patch-level alignment, enabling the MLLM to generate higher-quality captions, (2) improves the MLLM's performance by 16% on referring expression grounding tasks, 4% on question-answering tasks, and 3% on modern instruction-following benchmarks when using the same supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting. The proposed method can be easily extended to other multimodal models.

  Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset. Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided, yielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form video understanding tasks. The code will be released later.

  Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a key approach in achieving artificial general intelligence. In particular, vision-language MLLMs have been developed to generate not only text but also visual outputs from multimodal inputs. This advancement requires efficient image tokens that LLMs can process effectively both in input and output. However, existing image tokenization methods for MLLMs typically capture only global abstract concepts or uniformly segmented image patches, restricting MLLMs' capability to effectively understand or generate detailed visual content, particularly at the object level. To address this limitation, we propose an object-centric visual tokenizer based on Slot Attention specifically for MLLMs. In particular, based on the Q-Former encoder, diffusion decoder, and residual vector quantization, our proposed discretized slot tokens can encode local visual details while maintaining high-level semantics, and also align with textual data to be integrated seamlessly within a unified next-token prediction framework of LLMs. The resulting Slot-MLLM demonstrates significant performance improvements over baselines with previous visual tokenizers across various vision-language tasks that entail local detailed comprehension and generation. Notably, this work is the first demonstration of the feasibility of object-centric slot attention performed with MLLMs and in-the-wild natural images.

  The advent of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling will significantly transform the design of industrial products. The recent research endeavor has extended into the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs). In contrast to fine-tuning methods, training-free approaches typically utilize the advanced closed-source LLMs, thereby offering enhanced flexibility and efficiency in the development of AI agents for generating CAD parametric models. However, the substantial cost and limitations of local deployment of the top-tier closed-source LLMs pose challenges in practical applications. The Seek-CAD is the pioneer exploration of locally deployed open-source inference LLM DeepSeek-R1 for CAD parametric model generation with a training-free methodology. This study is the first investigation to incorporate both visual and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) feedback within the self-refinement mechanism for generating CAD models. Specifically, the initial generated parametric CAD model is rendered into a sequence of step-wise perspective images, which are subsequently processed by a Vision Language Model (VLM) alongside the corresponding CoTs derived from DeepSeek-R1 to assess the CAD model generation. Then, the feedback is utilized by DeepSeek-R1 to refine the initial generated model for the next round of generation. Moreover, we present an innovative 3D CAD model dataset structured around the SSR (Sketch, Sketch-based feature, and Refinements) triple design paradigm. This dataset encompasses a wide range of CAD commands, thereby aligning effectively with industrial application requirements and proving suitable for the generation of LLMs. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Seek-CAD under various metrics.

  Despite recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation, existing models often struggle to faithfully capture user intentions from short and under-specified prompts. While prior work has attempted to enhance prompts using large language models (LLMs), these methods frequently generate stylistic or unrealistic content due to insufficient grounding in visual semantics and real-world composition. Inspired by recent advances in reasoning for language model, we propose RePrompt, a novel reprompting framework that introduces explicit reasoning into the prompt enhancement process via reinforcement learning. Instead of relying on handcrafted rules or stylistic rewrites, our method trains a language model to generate structured, self-reflective prompts by optimizing for image-level outcomes. The tailored reward models assesse the generated images in terms of human preference, semantic alignment, and visual composition, providing indirect supervision to refine prompt generation. Our approach enables end-to-end training without human-annotated data. Experiments on GenEval and T2I-Compbench show that RePrompt significantly boosts spatial layout fidelity and compositional generalization across diverse T2I backbones, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

  Large multimodal models (LMMs) now excel on many vision language benchmarks, however, they still struggle with human centered criteria such as fairness, ethics, empathy, and inclusivity, key to aligning with human values. We introduce HumaniBench, a holistic benchmark of 32K real-world image question pairs, annotated via a scalable GPT4o assisted pipeline and exhaustively verified by domain experts. HumaniBench evaluates seven Human Centered AI (HCAI) principles: fairness, ethics, understanding, reasoning, language inclusivity, empathy, and robustness, across seven diverse tasks, including open and closed ended visual question answering (VQA), multilingual QA, visual grounding, empathetic captioning, and robustness tests. Benchmarking 15 state of the art LMMs (open and closed source) reveals that proprietary models generally lead, though robustness and visual grounding remain weak points. Some open-source models also struggle to balance accuracy with adherence to human-aligned principles. HumaniBench is the first benchmark purpose built around HCAI principles. It provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing alignment gaps and guiding LMMs toward behavior that is both accurate and socially responsible.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large foundation models trained on large-scale vision-language data can boost Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) via synthetic training data, yet the hand-crafted pipelines often introduce bias and overfit to specific prompts. We sidestep this issue by directly fusing hidden states from Large Language Models (LLMs) into detectors-an avenue surprisingly under-explored. This paper presents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder layers of the LLM of an MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention adapter to enable efficient knowledge fusion from LLMs to object detectors, a new approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We find that intermediate LLM layers already encode rich spatial semantics; adapting only the early layers yields most of the gain. With Swin-T as the vision encoder, Qwen2-0.5B + LED lifts GroundingDINO by 3.82 % on OmniLabel at just 8.7 % extra GFLOPs, and a larger vision backbone pushes the improvement to 6.22 %. Extensive ablations on adapter variants, LLM scales and fusion depths further corroborate our design.

  Visual Instruction Tuning (VisIT) data, commonly available as human-assistant conversations with images interleaved in the human turns, are currently the most widespread vehicle for aligning strong LLMs to understand visual inputs, converting them to strong LMMs. While many VisIT datasets are available, most are constructed using ad-hoc techniques developed independently by different groups. They are often poorly documented, lack reproducible code, and rely on paid, closed-source model APIs such as GPT-4, Gemini, or Claude to convert image metadata (labels) into VisIT instructions. This leads to high costs and makes it challenging to scale, enhance quality, or generate VisIT data for new datasets. In this work, we address these challenges and propose an open and unified recipe and approach,~\textbf{\method}, for converting available metadata to VisIT instructions using open LLMs. Our multi-stage \method features an efficient framework for metadata grouping, quality control, data and prompt organization, and conversation sampling. We show that our approach can reproduce or enhance the data quality of available VisIT datasets when applied to the same image data and metadata sources, improving GPT-4 generated VisIT instructions by ~3\% on average and up to 12\% on individual benchmarks using open models, such as Gemma 2 27B and LLaMa 3.1 70B. Additionally, our approach enables effective performance scaling - both in quantity and quality - by enhancing the resulting LMM performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We also analyze the impact of various factors, including conversation format, base model selection, and resampling strategies. Our code, which supports the reproduction of equal or higher-quality VisIT datasets and facilities future metadata-to-VisIT data conversion for niche domains, is released atthis https URL.

  While recent advances in image editing have enabled impressive visual synthesis capabilities, current methods remain constrained by explicit textual instructions and limited editing operations, lacking deep comprehension of implicit user intentions and contextual reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new image editing paradigm: reasoning-guided generative editing, which synthesizes images based on complex, multi-faceted textual queries accepting world knowledge and intention inference. To facilitate this task, we first construct a comprehensive dataset featuring over 1,000 image-instruction-edit triples that incorporate rich reasoning contexts and real-world knowledge. We then propose R-Genie: a reasoning-guided generative image editor, which synergizes the generation power of diffusion models with advanced reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models. R-Genie incorporates a reasoning-attention mechanism to bridge linguistic understanding with visual synthesis, enabling it to handle intricate editing requests involving abstract user intentions and contextual reasoning relations. Extensive experimental results validate that R-Genie can equip diffusion models with advanced reasoning-based editing capabilities, unlocking new potentials for intelligent image synthesis.

  Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have significantly enhanced the quality of generated videos. However, their ability to produce explicit or harmful content raises concerns about misuse and potential rights violations. Inspired by the success of unlearning techniques in erasing undesirable concepts from text-to-image (T2I) models, we extend unlearning to T2V models and propose a robust and precise unlearning method. Specifically, we adopt negatively-guided velocity prediction fine-tuning and enhance it with prompt augmentation to ensure robustness against LLM-refined prompts. To achieve precise unlearning, we incorporate a localization and a preservation regularization to preserve the model's ability to generate non-target concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively erases a specific concept while preserving the model's generation capability for all other concepts, outperforming existing methods. We provide the unlearned models in \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

  The detection and grounding of multimedia manipulation has emerged as a critical challenge in combating AI-generated disinformation. While existing methods have made progress in recent years, we identify two fundamental limitations in current approaches: (1) Underestimation of MLLM-driven deception risk: prevailing techniques primarily address rule-based text manipulations, yet fail to account for sophisticated misinformation synthesized by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that can dynamically generate semantically coherent, contextually plausible yet deceptive narratives conditioned on manipulated images; (2) Unrealistic misalignment artifacts: currently focused scenarios rely on artificially misaligned content that lacks semantic coherence, rendering them easily detectable. To address these gaps holistically, we propose a new adversarial pipeline that leverages MLLMs to generate high-risk disinformation. Our approach begins with constructing the MLLM-Driven Synthetic Multimodal (MDSM) dataset, where images are first altered using state-of-the-art editing techniques and then paired with MLLM-generated deceptive texts that maintain semantic consistency with the visual manipulations. Building upon this foundation, we present the Artifact-aware Manipulation Diagnosis via MLLM (AMD) framework featuring two key innovations: Artifact Pre-perception Encoding strategy and Manipulation-Oriented Reasoning, to tame MLLMs for the MDSM problem. Comprehensive experiments validate our framework's superior generalization capabilities as a unified architecture for detecting MLLM-powered multimodal deceptions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multimodal understanding and generation, yet their vulnerability to adversarial attacks raises significant robustness concerns. While existing effective attacks always focus on task-specific white-box settings, these approaches are limited in the context of LVLMs, which are designed for diverse downstream tasks and require expensive full-model gradient computations. Motivated by the pivotal role and wide adoption of the vision encoder in LVLMs, we propose a simple yet effective Vision Encoder Attack (VEAttack), which targets the vision encoder of LVLMs only. Specifically, we propose to generate adversarial examples by minimizing the cosine similarity between the clean and perturbed visual features, without accessing the following large language models, task information, and labels. It significantly reduces the computational overhead while eliminating the task and label dependence of traditional white-box attacks in LVLMs. To make this simple attack effective, we propose to perturb images by optimizing image tokens instead of the classification token. We provide both empirical and theoretical evidence that VEAttack can easily generalize to various tasks. VEAttack has achieved a performance degradation of 94.5% on image caption task and 75.7% on visual question answering task. We also reveal some key observations to provide insights into LVLM attack/defense: 1) hidden layer variations of LLM, 2) token attention differential, 3) M√∂bius band in transfer attack, 4) low sensitivity to attack steps.

  The rapid advancement of native multi-modal models and omni-models, exemplified by GPT-4o, Gemini, and o3, with their capability to process and generate content across modalities such as text and images, marks a significant milestone in the evolution of intelligence. Systematic evaluation of their multi-modal output capabilities in visual thinking processes (also known as multi-modal chain of thought, M-CoT) becomes critically important. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating multi-modal models primarily focus on assessing multi-modal inputs and text-only reasoning while neglecting the importance of reasoning through multi-modal outputs. In this paper, we present a benchmark, dubbed RBench-V, designed to assess models' vision-indispensable reasoning abilities. To construct RBench-V, we carefully hand-pick 803 questions covering math, physics, counting, and games. Unlike previous benchmarks that typically specify certain input modalities, RBench-V presents problems centered on multi-modal outputs, which require image manipulation such as generating novel images and constructing auxiliary lines to support the reasoning process. We evaluate numerous open- and closed-source models on RBench-V, including o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, etc. Even the best-performing model, o3, achieves only 25.8% accuracy on RBench-V, far below the human score of 82.3%, highlighting that current models struggle to leverage multi-modal reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work introduces panoptic captioning, a novel task striving to seek the minimum text equivalence of images. We take the first step towards panoptic captioning by formulating it as a task of generating a comprehensive textual description for an image, which encapsulates all entities, their respective locations and attributes, relationships among entities, as well as global image state. Through an extensive evaluation, our work reveals that state-of-the-art Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have limited performance in solving panoptic captioning. To address this, we propose an effective data engine named PancapEngine to produce high-quality data and a novel method named PancapChain to improve panoptic captioning. Specifically, our PancapEngine first detects diverse categories of entities in images by an elaborate detection suite, and then generates required panoptic captions using entity-aware prompts. Additionally, our PancapChain explicitly decouples the challenging panoptic captioning task into multiple stages and generates panoptic captions step by step. More importantly, we contribute a comprehensive metric named PancapScore and a human-curated test set for reliable model evaluation. Experiments show that our PancapChain-13B model can beat state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs like InternVL-2.5-78B and even surpass proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Pro, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data engine and method.

  Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automatically identifies anomalous events from video, mitigating the need for human operators in large-scale surveillance deployments. However, two fundamental obstacles hinder real-world adoption: domain dependency and real-time constraints -- requiring near-instantaneous processing of incoming video. To this end, we propose Flashback, a zero-shot and real-time video anomaly detection paradigm. Inspired by the human cognitive mechanism of instantly judging anomalies and reasoning in current scenes based on past experience, Flashback operates in two stages: Recall and Respond. In the offline recall stage, an off-the-shelf LLM builds a pseudo-scene memory of both normal and anomalous captions without any reliance on real anomaly data. In the online respond stage, incoming video segments are embedded and matched against this memory via similarity search. By eliminating all LLM calls at inference time, Flashback delivers real-time VAD even on a consumer-grade GPU. On two large datasets from real-world surveillance scenarios, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, we achieve 87.3 AUC (+7.0 pp) and 75.1 AP (+13.1 pp), respectively, outperforming prior zero-shot VAD methods by large margins.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements have enhanced the capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to comprehend multi-image information. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate answer correctness, overlooking whether models genuinely comprehend the visual input. To address this, we define implicit visual misunderstanding (IVM), where MLLMs provide correct answers without fully comprehending the visual input. Through our analysis, we decouple the visual and textual modalities within the causal attention module, revealing that attention distribution increasingly converges on the image associated with the correct answer as the network layers deepen. This insight leads to the introduction of a scale-agnostic metric, \textit{attention accuracy}, and a novel benchmark for quantifying IVMs. Attention accuracy directly evaluates the model's visual understanding via internal mechanisms, remaining robust to positional biases for more reliable assessments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to finer granularities and demonstrate its effectiveness in unimodal scenarios, underscoring its versatility and generalizability.

  The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.

  Image quality assessment (IQA) focuses on the perceptual visual quality of images, playing a crucial role in downstream tasks such as image reconstruction, compression, and generation. The rapid advancement of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly broadened the scope of IQA, moving toward comprehensive image quality understanding that incorporates content analysis, degradation perception, and comparison reasoning beyond mere numerical scoring. Previous MLLM-based methods typically either generate numerical scores lacking interpretability or heavily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using large-scale annotated datasets to provide descriptive assessments, limiting their flexibility and applicability. In this paper, we propose Q-Insight, a reinforcement learning-based model built upon group relative policy optimization (GRPO), which demonstrates strong visual reasoning capability for image quality understanding while requiring only a limited amount of rating scores and degradation labels. By jointly optimizing score regression and degradation perception tasks with carefully designed reward functions, our approach effectively exploits their mutual benefits for enhanced performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Insight substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both score regression and degradation perception tasks, while exhibiting impressive zero-shot generalization to comparison reasoning tasks.

  Recent advancements in generative AI have made text-guided image inpainting -- adding, removing, or altering image regions using textual prompts -- widely accessible. However, generating semantically correct photorealistic imagery, typically requires carefully-crafted prompts and iterative refinement by evaluating the realism of the generated content - tasks commonly performed by humans. To automate the generative process, we propose Semantically Aligned and Uncertainty Guided AI Image Inpainting (SAGI), a model-agnostic pipeline, to sample prompts from a distribution that closely aligns with human perception and to evaluate the generated content and discard one that deviates from such a distribution, which we approximate using pretrained Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models. By applying this pipeline on multiple state-of-the-art inpainting models, we create the SAGI Dataset (SAGI-D), currently the largest and most diverse dataset of AI-generated inpaintings, comprising over 95k inpainted images and a human-evaluated subset. Our experiments show that semantic alignment significantly improves image quality and aesthetics, while uncertainty guidance effectively identifies realistic manipulations - human ability to distinguish inpainted images from real ones drops from 74% to 35% in terms of accuracy, after applying our pipeline. Moreover, using SAGI-D for training several image forensic approaches increases in-domain detection performance on average by 37.4% and out-of-domain generalization by 26.1% in terms of IoU, also demonstrating its utility in countering malicious exploitation of generative AI.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the remarkable reasoning performance, eliciting the long chain-of-thought (CoT) ability in large language models (LLMs) typically requires costly reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning on high-quality distilled data. We investigate the internal mechanisms behind this capability and show that a small set of high-impact activations in the last few layers largely governs long-form reasoning attributes, such as output length and self-reflection. By simply amplifying these activations and inserting "wait" tokens, we can invoke the long CoT ability without any training, resulting in significantly increased self-reflection rates and accuracy. Moreover, we find that the activation dynamics follow predictable trajectories, with a sharp rise after special tokens and a subsequent exponential decay. Building on these insights, we introduce a general training-free activation control technique. It leverages a few contrastive examples to identify key activations, and employs simple analytic functions to modulate their values at inference time to elicit long CoTs. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method in efficiently eliciting long CoT reasoning in LLMs and improving their performance. Additionally, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that trains only a last-layer activation amplification module and a few LoRA layers, outperforming full LoRA fine-tuning on reasoning benchmarks with significantly fewer parameters. Our code and data are publicly released.

  Ensuring faithful interpretability in large language models is imperative for trustworthy and reliable AI. A key obstacle is self-repair, a phenomenon where networks compensate for reduced signal in one component by amplifying others, masking the true importance of the ablated component. While prior work attributes self-repair to layer normalization and back-up components that compensate for ablated components, we identify a novel form occurring within the attention mechanism, where softmax redistribution conceals the influence of important attention scores. This leads traditional ablation and gradient-based methods to underestimate the significance of all components contributing to these attention scores. We introduce Gradient Interaction Modifications (GIM), a technique that accounts for self-repair during backpropagation. Extensive experiments across multiple large language models (Gemma 2B/9B, LLAMA 1B/3B/8B, Qwen 1.5B/3B) and diverse tasks demonstrate that GIM significantly improves faithfulness over existing circuit identification and feature attribution methods. Our work is a significant step toward better understanding the inner mechanisms of LLMs, which is crucial for improving them and ensuring their safety. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, their substantial inference cost poses a major barrier to real-world deployment, especially in latency-sensitive scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{DASH}, an adaptive layer-skipping framework that dynamically selects computation paths conditioned on input characteristics. We model the skipping process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling fine-grained token-level decisions based on intermediate representations. To mitigate potential performance degradation caused by skipping, we introduce a lightweight compensation mechanism that injects differential rewards into the decision process. Furthermore, we design an asynchronous execution strategy that overlaps layer computation with policy evaluation to minimize runtime overhead. Experiments on multiple LLM architectures and NLP benchmarks show that our method achieves significant inference acceleration while maintaining competitive task performance, outperforming existing methods.

  Large language models suffer issues when operated on long contexts that are larger than their training context length due to the standard position encoding for tokens in the attention layer. Tokens a long distance apart will rarely have an effect on each other and long prompts yield unexpected results. To solve this problem, we propose SELF (Self-Extend the Context Length With Logistic Growth Function): a solution of grouping consecutive tokens at varying group sizes using a logistic capacity equation combined with a constant group size at smaller relative distances. Our model had an increase in performance of up to 12% compared to the LongLM extension method in LEval (specifically on the Qwen model). On summarization related tasks in LongBench, our model performed up to 6.4% better than LongLM (specifically on the Llama-2-7b model). On reading comprehension tasks from LEval, our model performed up to 5.4% better than the LongLM. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly transformed Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications by enabling more advanced analysis of customer personas. At Volvo Construction Equipment (VCE), customer personas have traditionally been developed through qualitative methods, which are time-consuming and lack scalability. The main objective of this paper is to generate synthetic customer personas and integrate them into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to support decision-making in business processes. To this end, we first focus on developing a persona-based RAG chatbot integrated with verified personas. Next, synthetic personas are generated using Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques and evaluated based on completeness, relevance, and consistency using McNemar's test. In the final step, the chatbot's knowledge base is augmented with synthetic personas and additional segment information to assess improvements in response accuracy and practical utility. Key findings indicate that Few-Shot prompting outperformed CoT in generating more complete personas, while CoT demonstrated greater efficiency in terms of response time and token usage. After augmenting the knowledge base, the average accuracy rating of the chatbot increased from 5.88 to 6.42 on a 10-point scale, and 81.82% of participants found the updated system useful in business contexts.

  Recent research leverages large language models (LLMs) for early mental health detection, such as depression, often optimized with machine-generated data. However, their detection may be subject to unknown weaknesses. Meanwhile, quality control has not been applied to these generated corpora besides limited human verifications. Our goal is to systematically evaluate LLM reasoning and reveal potential weaknesses. To this end, we first provide a systematic evaluation of the reasoning over machine-generated detection and interpretation. Then we use the models' reasoning abilities to explore mitigation strategies for enhanced performance. Specifically, we do the following: A. Design an LLM instruction strategy that allows for systematic analysis of the detection by breaking down the task into several subtasks. B. Design contrastive few-shot and chain-of-thought prompts by selecting typical positive and negative examples of detection reasoning. C. Perform human annotation for the subtasks identified in the first step and evaluate the performance. D. Identify human-preferred detection with desired logical reasoning from the few-shot generation and use them to explore different optimization strategies. We conducted extensive comparisons on the DepTweet dataset across the following subtasks: 1. identifying whether the speaker is describing their own depression; 2. accurately detecting the presence of PHQ-9 symptoms, and 3. finally, detecting depression. Human verification of statistical outliers shows that LLMs demonstrate greater accuracy in analyzing and detecting explicit language of depression as opposed to implicit expressions of depression. Two optimization methods are used for performance enhancement and reduction of the statistic bias: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). Notably, the DPO approach achieves significant performance improvement.

  Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models LLMs, have shown promising capabilities in transforming rare disease research. This survey paper explores the integration of LLMs in the analysis of rare diseases, highlighting significant strides and pivotal studies that leverage textual data to uncover insights and patterns critical for diagnosis, treatment, and patient care. While current research predominantly employs textual data, the potential for multimodal data integration combining genetic, imaging, and electronic health records stands as a promising frontier. We review foundational papers that demonstrate the application of LLMs in identifying and extracting relevant medical information, simulating intelligent conversational agents for patient interaction, and enabling the formulation of accurate and timely diagnoses. Furthermore, this paper discusses the challenges and ethical considerations inherent in deploying LLMs, including data privacy, model transparency, and the need for robust, inclusive data sets. As part of this exploration, we present a section on experimentation that utilizes multiple LLMs alongside structured questionnaires, specifically designed for diagnostic purposes in the context of different diseases. We conclude with future perspectives on the evolution of LLMs towards truly multimodal platforms, which would integrate diverse data types to provide a more comprehensive understanding of rare diseases, ultimately fostering better outcomes in clinical settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  During the finetuning stage of text generation tasks, standard cross-entropy loss treats all tokens equally. This can lead models to overemphasize high-frequency, low-information tokens, neglecting lower-frequency tokens crucial for specificity and informativeness in generated content. This paper introduces a novel loss function, Power-Law Decay Loss (PDL), specifically designed to optimize the finetuning process for text generation. The core motivation for PDL stems from observations in information theory and linguistics: the informativeness of a token is often inversely proportional to its frequency of occurrence. PDL re-weights the contribution of each token in the standard cross-entropy loss based on its frequency in the training corpus, following a power-law decay. Specifically, the weights for high-frequency tokens are reduced, while low-frequency, information-dense tokens are assigned higher weights. This mechanism guides the model during finetuning to focus more on learning and generating tokens that convey specific and unique information, thereby enhancing the quality, diversity, and informativeness of the generated text. We theoretically elaborate on the motivation and construction of PDL and discuss its potential applications and advantages across various text generation finetuning tasks, such as abstractive summarization, dialogue systems, and style transfer.

  Tokenization is a fundamental component of large language models (LLMs), yet its influence on model scaling and performance is not fully explored. In this paper, we introduce Over-Tokenized Transformers, a novel framework that decouples input and output vocabularies to improve language modeling performance. Specifically, our approach scales up input vocabularies to leverage multi-gram tokens. Through extensive experiments, we uncover a log-linear relationship between input vocabulary size and training loss, demonstrating that larger input vocabularies consistently enhance model performance, regardless of model size. Using a large input vocabulary, we achieve performance comparable to double-sized baselines with no additional cost. Our findings highlight the importance of tokenization in scaling laws and provide practical insight for tokenizer design, paving the way for more efficient and powerful LLMs.

  In this paper, we study format biases in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We observe that many widely-used preference models, including human evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark, exhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links, bold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit these biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval and LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example of this is verbosity bias, where current preference models favor longer responses that appear more comprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter, competing responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely underexplored in the literature. In this work, we extend the study of biases in preference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a comprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show that with a small amount of biased data (less than 1%), we can inject significant bias into the reward model. Moreover, these format biases can also be easily exploited by downstream alignment algorithms, such as best-of-n sampling and online iterative DPO, as it is usually easier to manipulate the format than to improve the quality of responses. Our findings emphasize the need to disentangle format and content both for designing alignment algorithms and evaluating models.

  The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the transparency and fair use of the data used in their pretraining. Detecting such content is challenging due to the scale of the data and limited exposure of each instance during training. We propose ReCaLL (Relative Conditional Log-Likelihood), a novel membership inference attack (MIA) to detect LLMs' pretraining data by leveraging their conditional language modeling capabilities. ReCaLL examines the relative change in conditional log-likelihoods when prefixing target data points with non-member context. Our empirical findings show that conditioning member data on non-member prefixes induces a larger decrease in log-likelihood compared to non-member data. We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that ReCaLL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WikiMIA dataset, even with random and synthetic prefixes, and can be further improved using an ensemble approach. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LLMs' behavior with different membership contexts, providing insights into how LLMs leverage membership information for effective inference at both the sequence and token level.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various real-world scenarios due to their excellent generalization capabilities and robust generative abilities. However, they exhibit position bias, also known as "lost in the middle", a phenomenon that is especially pronounced in long-context scenarios, which indicates the placement of the key information in different positions of a prompt can significantly affect accuracy. This paper first explores the micro-level manifestations of position bias, concluding that attention weights are a micro-level expression of position bias. It further identifies that, in addition to position embeddings, causal attention mask also contributes to position bias by creating position-specific hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose a method to mitigate position bias by scaling this positional hidden states. Experiments on the NaturalQuestions Multi-document QA, KV retrieval, LongBench and timeline reorder tasks, using various models including RoPE models, context windowextended models, and Alibi models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach. Our method can improve performance by up to 15.2% by modifying just one dimension of hidden states. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable impacts across a wide spectrum of natural language processing tasks. Fine-tuning these pretrained models on downstream datasets provides further significant performance gains; however, this process typically requires a large number of expensive, high-end GPUs. Although there have been efforts focused on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, they cannot fully unlock the powerful potential of full-parameter fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose QFT, a Quantized Full-parameter Tuning framework for LLMs that quantizes and stores all training states, including weights, gradients, and optimizer states, in INT8 format to reduce training memory, thereby enabling full-parameter fine-tuning on existing GPUs at an affordable cost. To ensure training performance, we make two key efforts: i) for quantized gradients and optimizer states, we theoretically prove that the Lion optimizer, with its property of consistent update magnitudes, is highly robust to quantization; ii) and for quantized weights, we employ the hybrid feature quantizer, which identifies and protects a small subset of sparse critical features while quantizing the remaining dense features, thus ensuring accurate weight updates without FP32 backups. Moreover, to support backpropagation in the integer context, we develop a stack-based gradient flow scheme with O(1) complexity, forming a unified integer training pipeline. As a result, QFT reduces the model state memory to 21% of the standard solution while achieving comparable performance, e.g., tuning a LLaMA-7B model requires only <30GB of memory, making it feasible on a single A6000 GPU.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and growing interest in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the ability to understand table structures has become increasingly important. This is especially critical in financial domains such as securities reports, where highly accurate question answering (QA) over tables is required. However, tables exist in various formats-including HTML, images, and plain text-making it difficult to preserve and extract structural information. Therefore, multimodal LLMs are essential for robust and general-purpose table understanding. Despite their promise, current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are major representatives of multimodal LLMs, still face challenges in accurately understanding characters and their spatial relationships within documents. In this study, we propose a method to enhance LVLM-based table understanding by incorporating in-table textual content and layout features. Experimental results demonstrate that these auxiliary modalities significantly improve performance, enabling robust interpretation of complex document layouts without relying on explicitly structured input formats.

  Evaluating long-context radiology report generation is challenging. NLG metrics fail to capture clinical correctness, while LLM-based metrics often lack generalizability. Clinical accuracy metrics are more relevant but are sensitive to class imbalance, frequently favoring trivial predictions. We propose the CRG Score, a distribution-aware and adaptable metric that evaluates only clinically relevant abnormalities explicitly described in reference reports. CRG supports both binary and structured labels (e.g., type, location) and can be paired with any LLM for feature extraction. By balancing penalties based on label distribution, it enables fairer, more robust evaluation and serves as a clinically aligned reward function.

  Enterprise customers are increasingly adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) for critical communication tasks, such as drafting emails, crafting sales pitches, and composing casual messages. Deploying such models across different regions requires them to understand diverse cultural and linguistic contexts and generate safe and respectful responses. For enterprise applications, it is crucial to mitigate reputational risks, maintain trust, and ensure compliance by effectively identifying and handling unsafe or offensive language. To address this, we introduce SweEval, a benchmark simulating real-world scenarios with variations in tone (positive or negative) and context (formal or informal). The prompts explicitly instruct the model to include specific swear words while completing the task. This benchmark evaluates whether LLMs comply with or resist such inappropriate instructions and assesses their alignment with ethical frameworks, cultural nuances, and language comprehension capabilities. In order to advance research in building ethically aligned AI systems for enterprise use and beyond, we release the dataset and code:this https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges with needle-in-a-haystack tasks, where relevant information ("the needle") must be drawn from a large pool of irrelevant context ("the haystack"). Previous studies have highlighted positional bias and distractor quantity as critical factors affecting model performance, yet the influence of gold context size has received little attention. We address this gap by systematically studying how variations in gold context length impact LLM performance on long-context question answering tasks. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance drops sharply when the gold context is shorter, i.e., smaller gold contexts consistently degrade model performance and amplify positional sensitivity, posing a major challenge for agentic systems that must integrate scattered, fine-grained information of varying lengths. This pattern holds across three diverse domains (general knowledge, biomedical reasoning, and mathematical reasoning) and seven state-of-the-art LLMs of various sizes and architectures. Our work provides clear insights to guide the design of robust, context-aware LLM-driven systems.

  Refusal discovery is the task of identifying the full set of topics that a language model refuses to discuss. We introduce this new problem setting and develop a refusal discovery method, LLM-crawler, that uses token prefilling to find forbidden topics. We benchmark the LLM-crawler on Tulu-3-8B, an open-source model with public safety tuning data. Our crawler manages to retrieve 31 out of 36 topics within a budget of 1000 prompts. Next, we scale the crawl to a frontier model using the prefilling option of Claude-Haiku. Finally, we crawl three widely used open-weight models: Llama-3.3-70B and two of its variants finetuned for reasoning: DeepSeek-R1-70B and Perplexity-R1-1776-70B. DeepSeek-R1-70B reveals patterns consistent with censorship tuning: The model exhibits "thought suppression" behavior that indicates memorization of CCP-aligned responses. Although Perplexity-R1-1776-70B is robust to censorship, LLM-crawler elicits CCP-aligned refusals answers in the quantized model. Our findings highlight the critical need for refusal discovery methods to detect biases, boundaries, and alignment failures of AI systems.

  In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks without weight updates by learning from demonstration sequences. While ICL shows strong empirical performance, its internal representational mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we conduct a statistical geometric analysis of ICL representations to investigate how task-specific information is captured across layers. Our analysis reveals an intriguing phenomenon, which we term *Layerwise Compression-Expansion*: early layers progressively produce compact and discriminative representations that encode task information from the input demonstrations, while later layers expand these representations to incorporate the query and generate the prediction. This phenomenon is observed consistently across diverse tasks and a range of contemporary LLM architectures. We demonstrate that it has important implications for ICL performance -- improving with model size and the number of demonstrations -- and for robustness in the presence of noisy examples. To further understand the effect of the compact task representation, we propose a bias-variance decomposition and provide a theoretical analysis showing how attention mechanisms contribute to reducing both variance and bias, thereby enhancing performance as the number of demonstrations increases. Our findings reveal an intriguing layerwise dynamic in ICL, highlight how structured representations emerge within LLMs, and showcase that analyzing internal representations can facilitate a deeper understanding of model behavior.

  Large language models excel at complex tasks by breaking down problems into structured reasoning steps. However, reasoning traces often extend beyond reaching a correct answer, causing wasted computation, reduced readability, and hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a novel hyperparameter-free conciseness score used as a reward signal within a reinforcement learning framework to guide models toward generating correct and concise reasoning traces. This score is evaluated by a large language model acting as a judge, enabling dynamic, context-aware feedback beyond simple token length. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs on the MATH dataset, reducing token usage by up to 31x on simple problems while improving accuracy by 7%, and on the hardest problems, it outperforms full reasoning by +7.5% accuracy with up to 3.6x fewer tokens. On TheoremQA, our method improves accuracy by +2.2% using 12.5x fewer tokens. We also conduct ablation studies on the judge model, reward composition, and problem difficulty, showing that our method dynamically adapts reasoning length based on problem difficulty and benefits significantly from stronger judges. The code, model weights, and datasets are open-sourced atthis https URL.

  As the knowledge of large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated over time, there is a growing need for efficient methods to update them, especially when injecting proprietary information. Our study reveals that comprehension-intensive fine-tuning tasks (e.g., question answering and blanks) achieve substantially higher knowledge retention rates (48%) compared to mapping-oriented tasks like translation (17%) or text-to-JSON conversion (20%), despite exposure to identical factual content. We demonstrate that this pattern persists across model architectures and follows scaling laws, with larger models showing improved retention across all task types. However, all models exhibit significant performance drops when applying injected knowledge in broader contexts, suggesting limited semantic integration. These findings show the importance of task selection in updating LLM knowledge, showing that effective knowledge injection relies not just on data exposure but on the depth of cognitive engagement during fine-tuning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by employing a small speculative model (SSM) to generate multiple candidate tokens and verify them using the LLM in parallel. This technique has been widely integrated into LLM inference serving systems. However, inference requests typically exhibit uncertain execution time, which poses a significant challenge of efficiently scheduling requests in these systems. Existing work estimates execution time based solely on predicted output length, which could be inaccurate because execution time depends on both output length and token acceptance rate of verification by the LLM. In this paper, we propose a semi-clairvoyant request scheduling algorithm called Least-Attained/Perceived-Service for Speculative Decoding (LAPS-SD). Given a number of inference requests, LAPS-SD can effectively minimize average inference latency by adaptively scheduling requests according to their features during decoding. When the token acceptance rate is dynamic and execution time is difficult to estimate, LAPS-SD maintains multiple priority queues and allows request execution preemption across different queues. Once the token acceptance rate becomes stable, LAPS-SD can accurately estimate the execution time and schedule requests accordingly. Extensive experiments show that LAPS-SD reduces inference latency by approximately 39\% compared to state-of-the-art scheduling methods.

  Mechanistic interpretability research seeks to reveal the inner workings of large language models, yet most work focuses on classification or generative tasks rather than summarization. This paper presents an interpretability framework for analyzing how GPT-like models adapt to summarization tasks. We conduct differential analysis between pre-trained and fine-tuned models, quantifying changes in attention patterns and internal activations. By identifying specific layers and attention heads that undergo significant transformation, we locate the "summarization circuit" within the model architecture. Our findings reveal that middle layers (particularly 2, 3, and 5) exhibit the most dramatic changes, with 62% of attention heads showing decreased entropy, indicating a shift toward focused information selection. We demonstrate that targeted LoRA adaptation of these identified circuits achieves significant performance improvement over standard LoRA fine-tuning while requiring fewer training epochs. This work bridges the gap between black-box evaluation and mechanistic understanding, providing insights into how neural networks perform information selection and compression during summarization.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful way to adapt foundation models to specialized tasks, but its reliance on large-scale human-labeled data limits broad adoption. We introduce Synthetic Data RL, a simple and general framework that reinforcement fine-tunes models using only synthetic data generated from a task definition. Our method first generates question and answer pairs from the task definition and retrieved documents, then adapts the difficulty of the question based on model solvability, and selects questions using the average pass rate of the model across samples for RL training. On Qwen-2.5-7B, our method achieves a 29.2% absolute improvement over the base model on GSM8K (+2.9 pp vs. instruction-tuned, +6.6 pp vs. Self-Instruct), 8.7% on MATH, 13.1% on GPQA (+7.0 pp vs. SynthLLM), 8.9% on MedQA, 17.7% on CQA (law) and 13.7% on CFA (finance). It surpasses supervised fine-tuning under the same data budget and nearly matches RL with full human data across datasets (e.g., +17.2 pp on GSM8K). Adding 100 human demonstrations improves the performance of GSM8K only by 0.4 pp, showing a limited added value. By reducing human data annotation, Synthetic Data RL enables scalable and efficient RL-based model adaptation. Code and demos are available atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in machine translation (MT). However, most advanced MT-specific LLMs heavily rely on external supervision signals during training, such as human-annotated reference data or trained reward models (RMs), which are often expensive to obtain and challenging to scale. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for MT that is reference-free, fully online, and relies solely on self-judging rewards. Training with SSR using 13K monolingual examples and Qwen-2.5-7B as the backbone, our model SSR-Zero-7B outperforms existing MT-specific LLMs, e.g., TowerInstruct-13B and GemmaX-28-9B, as well as larger general LLMs like Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation tasks from WMT23, WMT24, and Flores200 benchmarks. Furthermore, by augmenting SSR with external supervision from COMET, our strongest model, SSR-X-Zero-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation, surpassing all existing open-source models under 72B parameters and even outperforming closed-source models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of the self-rewarding mechanism compared to the external LLM-as-a-judge approach in MT and demonstrates its complementary benefits when combined with trained RMs. Our findings provide valuable insight into the potential of self-improving RL methods. We have publicly released our code, data and models.

  Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of tasks, but adapting them efficiently to new domains remains a key challenge. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by introducing lightweight, trainable modules while keeping most pre-trained weights fixed. The prevailing approach, LoRA, models updates using a low-rank decomposition, but its expressivity is inherently constrained by the rank. Recent methods like HiRA aim to increase expressivity by incorporating a Hadamard product with the frozen weights, but still rely on the structure of the pre-trained model. We introduce ABBA, a new PEFT architecture that reparameterizes the update as a Hadamard product of two independently learnable low-rank matrices. In contrast to prior work, ABBA fully decouples the update from the pre-trained weights, enabling both components to be optimized freely. This leads to significantly higher expressivity under the same parameter budget. We formally analyze ABBA's expressive capacity and validate its advantages through matrix reconstruction experiments. Empirically, ABBA achieves state-of-the-art results on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing PEFT methods by a significant margin across multiple models.

  Scaling data quantity is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet recent findings show that data quality can significantly boost performance and training efficiency. We introduce a German-language dataset curation pipeline that combines heuristic and model-based filtering techniques with synthetic data generation. We use our pipeline to create Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb, a large-scale German pre-training dataset which draws from: (1) Common Crawl web data, (2) FineWeb2, and (3) synthetically-generated data conditioned on actual, organic web data. We evaluate our dataset by pre-training both a 1B Llama-style model and an 8B tokenizer-free hierarchical autoregressive transformer (HAT). A comparison on German-language benchmarks, including MMMLU, shows significant performance gains of Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb over FineWeb2 alone. This advantage holds at the 8B scale even when FineWeb2 is enriched by human-curated high-quality data sources such as Wikipedia. Our findings support the growing body of evidence that model-based data curation and synthetic data generation can significantly enhance LLM pre-training datasets.

  Causal reasoning and compositional reasoning are two core aspirations in AI. Measuring the extent of these behaviors requires principled evaluation methods. We explore a unified perspective that considers both behaviors simultaneously, termed compositional causal reasoning (CCR): the ability to infer how causal measures compose and, equivalently, how causal quantities propagate through graphs. We instantiate a framework for the systematic evaluation of CCR for the average treatment effect and the probability of necessity and sufficiency. As proof of concept, we demonstrate CCR evaluation for language models in the LLama, Phi, and GPT families. On a math word problem, our framework revealed a range of taxonomically distinct error patterns. CCR errors increased with the complexity of causal paths for all models except o1.

  The escalating scale and cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) training necessitate accurate pre-training prediction of downstream task performance for efficient resource allocation. This is challenged by: 1) the emergence phenomenon, where metrics become meaningful only after extensive training, hindering prediction by smaller models; and 2) uneven task difficulty and inconsistent performance scaling patterns, leading to high metric variability. Current prediction methods lack accuracy and reliability. We propose a Clustering-On-Difficulty (COD) framework for downstream performance prediction. The COD framework clusters tasks by their difficulty scaling features, thereby establishing a more stable and predictable support subset through the exclusion of tasks exhibiting non-emergent behavior or irregular scaling. We adopt a performance scaling law to predict cluster-wise performance with theoretical support. Predictable subset performance acts as an intermediate predictor for the full evaluation set. We further derive a mapping function to accurately extrapolate the performance of the subset to the full set. Applied to an LLM with 70B parameters, COD achieved a 1.36% average prediction error across eight key LLM benchmarks, offering actionable insights for resource allocation and training monitoring of LLMs pretraining.

  We introduce CopySpec, a simple yet effective technique to tackle the inefficiencies LLMs face when generating responses that closely resemble previous outputs or responses that can be verbatim extracted from context. CopySpec identifies repeated sequences in the model's chat history or context and speculates that the same tokens will follow, enabling seamless copying without compromising output quality and without requiring additional GPU memory. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments using seven LLMs and five datasets: MT-Bench, CNN/DM, GSM8K, HumanEval, and our newly created dataset, MT-Redundant. MT-Redundant, introduced in this paper, transforms the second turn of MT-Bench into a request for variations of the first turn's answer, simulating real-world scenarios where users request modifications to prior responses. Our results demonstrate significant speed-ups: up to 2.35x on CNN/DM, 3.08x on the second turn of select MT-Redundant categories, and 2.66x on the third turn of GSM8K's self-correction tasks. Importantly, we show that CopySpec integrates seamlessly with speculative decoding, yielding an average 49% additional speed-up over speculative decoding for the second turn of MT-Redundant across all eight categories. While LLMs, even with speculative decoding, suffer from slower inference as context size grows, CopySpec leverages larger contexts to accelerate inference, making it a faster complementary solution.

  Process Reward Models (PRMs) have shown promise in enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Test-Time Scaling (TTS). However, their integration into multimodal reasoning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we take the first step toward unlocking the potential of PRMs in multimodal mathematical reasoning. We identify three key challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality reasoning data constrains the capabilities of foundation Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which imposes further limitations on the upper bounds of TTS and reinforcement learning (RL); (2) a lack of automated methods for process labeling within multimodal contexts persists; (3) the employment of process rewards in unimodal RL faces issues like reward hacking, which may extend to multimodal scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce URSA, a three-stage Unfolding multimodal Process-Supervision Aided training framework. We first construct MMathCoT-1M, a high-quality large-scale multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning dataset, to build a stronger math reasoning foundation MLLM, URSA-8B. Subsequently, we go through an automatic process to synthesize process supervision data, which emphasizes both logical correctness and perceptual consistency. We introduce DualMath-1.1M to facilitate the training of URSA-8B-RM. Finally, we propose Process-Supervised Group-Relative-Policy-Optimization (PS-GRPO), pioneering a multimodal PRM-aided online RL method that outperforms vanilla GRPO. With PS-GRPO application, URSA-8B-PS-GRPO outperforms Gemma3-12B and GPT-4o by 8.4% and 2.7% on average across 6 benchmarks. Code, data and checkpoint can be found atthis https URL.

  Low-rank adapters have become standard for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), but they often fall short of achieving the performance of full fine-tuning. We propose a method, LoRA Silver Bullet or LoRA-SB, that approximates full fine-tuning within low-rank subspaces using a carefully designed initialization strategy. We theoretically demonstrate that the architecture of LoRA-XS, which inserts a learnable (r x r) matrix between B and A while keeping other matrices fixed, provides the precise conditions needed for this approximation. We leverage its constrained update space to achieve optimal scaling for high-rank gradient updates while removing the need for hyperparameter tuning. We prove that our initialization offers an optimal low-rank approximation of the initial gradient and preserves update directions throughout training. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and language understanding tasks demonstrate that our approach exceeds the performance of standard LoRA while using \textbf{27-90} times fewer learnable parameters, and comprehensively outperforms LoRA-XS. Our findings establish that it is possible to simulate full fine-tuning in low-rank subspaces, and achieve significant efficiency gains without sacrificing performance. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks like question answering and dialogue, but complex tasks requiring interaction, such as negotiation and persuasion, require additional long-horizon reasoning and planning. Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning can enable such planning in principle, but suffers from drawbacks that hinder scalability. In particular, multi-turn RL training incurs high memory and computational costs, which are exacerbated when training LLMs as policies. Furthermore, the largest LLMs do not expose the APIs necessary to be trained in such manner. As a result, modern methods to improve the reasoning of LLMs rely on sophisticated prompting mechanisms rather than RL fine-tuning. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach that uses goal-conditioned value functions to guide the reasoning of LLM agents, that scales even to large API-based models. These value functions predict how a task will unfold given an action, allowing the LLM agent to evaluate multiple possible outcomes, both positive and negative, to plan effectively. In addition, these value functions are trained over reasoning steps rather than full actions, to be a concise and light-weight module that facilitates decision-making in multi-turn interactions. We validate our method on tasks requiring interaction, including tool use, social deduction, and dialogue, demonstrating superior performance over both RL fine-tuning and prompting methods while maintaining efficiency and scalability.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in complex reasoning tasks such as math and coding. In contrast to these tasks where deductive reasoning predominates, inductive reasoning\textemdash the ability to derive general rules from incomplete evidence, remains underexplored. This paper investigates extended inductive reasoning in LLMs through the lens of personalized preference inference, a critical challenge in LLM alignment where current approaches struggle to capture diverse user preferences. The task demands strong inductive reasoning capabilities as user preferences are typically embedded implicitly across various interaction forms, requiring models to synthesize consistent preference patterns from scattered signals. We propose \textsc{AlignXplore}, a model that leverages extended reasoning chains to enable systematic preference inference from behavioral signals in users' interaction histories. We develop \textsc{AlignXplore} by combining cold-start training based on synthetic data with subsequent online reinforcement learning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that \textsc{AlignXplore} achieves substantial improvements over the backbone model by an average of 11.05\% on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability across different input formats and downstream models. Further analyses establish best practices for preference inference learning through systematic comparison of reward modeling strategies, while revealing the emergence of human-like inductive reasoning patterns during training.

  Despite the rapid progress in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they continue to have difficulty following relatively simple, unambiguous instructions, especially when compositions are involved. In this paper, we take inspiration from recent work that suggests that models may follow instructions better when they are expressed in pseudo-code. However, writing pseudo-code programs can be tedious and using few-shot demonstrations to craft code representations for use in inference can be unnatural for non-expert users of LLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose fine-tuning LLMs with instruction-tuning data that additionally includes instructions re-expressed in pseudo-code along with the final response. We evaluate models trained using our method on $11$ publicly available benchmarks comprising of tasks related to instruction-following, mathematics, and common-sense reasoning. We conduct rigorous experiments with $5$ different models and find that not only do models follow instructions better when trained with pseudo-code, they also retain their capabilities on the other tasks related to mathematical and common sense reasoning. Specifically, we observe a relative gain of $3$--$19$% on instruction-following benchmark, and an average gain of upto 14% across all tasks.

  Improving performance on complex tasks and enabling interpretable decision making in large language models (LLMs), especially for clinical applications, requires effective reasoning. Yet this remains challenging without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on costly chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o). In this work, we present AlphaMed, the first medical LLM to show that reasoning capability can emerge purely through reinforcement learning (RL), using minimalist rule-based rewards on public multiple-choice QA datasets, without relying on SFT or distilled CoT data. AlphaMed achieves state-of-the-art results on six medical QA benchmarks, outperforming models trained with conventional SFT+RL pipelines. On challenging benchmarks (e.g., MedXpert), AlphaMed even surpasses larger or closed-source models such as DeepSeek-V3-671B and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. To understand the factors behind this success, we conduct a comprehensive data-centric analysis guided by three questions: (i) Can minimalist rule-based RL incentivize reasoning without distilled CoT supervision? (ii) How do dataset quantity and diversity impact reasoning? (iii) How does question difficulty shape the emergence and generalization of reasoning? Our findings show that dataset informativeness is a key driver of reasoning performance, and that minimalist RL on informative, multiple-choice QA data is effective at inducing reasoning without CoT supervision. We also observe divergent trends across benchmarks, underscoring limitations in current evaluation and the need for more challenging, reasoning-oriented medical QA benchmarks.

  We introduce Mutarjim, a compact yet powerful language model for bidirectional Arabic-English translation. While large-scale LLMs have shown impressive progress in natural language processing tasks, including machine translation, smaller models. Leveraging this insight, we developed Mutarjim based on Kuwain-1.5B , a language model tailored for both Arabic and English. Despite its modest size, Mutarjim outperforms much larger models on several established benchmarks, achieved through an optimized two-phase training approach and a carefully curated, high-quality training corpus.. Experimental results show that Mutarjim rivals models up to 20 times larger while significantly reducing computational costs and training requirements. We also introduce Tarjama-25, a new benchmark designed to overcome limitations in existing Arabic-English benchmarking datasets, such as domain narrowness, short sentence lengths, and English-source bias. Tarjama-25 comprises 5,000 expert-reviewed sentence pairs and spans a wide range of domains, offering a more comprehensive and balanced evaluation framework. Notably, Mutarjim achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English-to-Arabic task in Tarjama-25, surpassing even significantly larger and proprietary models like GPT-4o mini. We publicly release Tarjama-25 to support future research and advance the evaluation of Arabic-English translation systems.

  Reasoning large language models (LLMs) heavily rely on scaling test-time compute to perform complex reasoning tasks by generating extensive "thinking" chains. While demonstrating impressive results, this approach incurs significant computational costs and inference time. In this work, we challenge the assumption that long thinking chains results in better reasoning capabilities. We first demonstrate that shorter reasoning chains within individual questions are significantly more likely to yield correct answers - up to 34.5% more accurate than the longest chain sampled for the same question. Based on these results, we suggest short-m@k, a novel reasoning LLM inference method. Our method executes k independent generations in parallel and halts computation once the first m thinking processes are done. The final answer is chosen using majority voting among these m chains. Basic short-1@k demonstrates similar or even superior performance over standard majority voting in low-compute settings - using up to 40% fewer thinking tokens. short-3@k, while slightly less efficient than short-1@k, consistently surpasses majority voting across all compute budgets, while still being substantially faster (up to 33% wall time reduction). Inspired by our results, we finetune an LLM using short, long, and randomly selected reasoning chains. We then observe that training on the shorter ones leads to better performance. Our findings suggest rethinking current methods of test-time compute in reasoning LLMs, emphasizing that longer "thinking" does not necessarily translate to improved performance and can, counter-intuitively, lead to degraded results.

  Large-language-model (LLM) agents excel at reactive dialogue but struggle with proactive, goal-driven interactions due to myopic decoding and costly planning. We introduce DialogXpert, which leverages a frozen LLM to propose a small, high-quality set of candidate actions per turn and employs a compact Q-network over fixed BERT embeddings trained via temporal-difference learning to select optimal moves within this reduced space. By tracking the user's emotions, DialogXpert tailors each decision to advance the task while nurturing a genuine, empathetic connection. Across negotiation, emotional support, and tutoring benchmarks, DialogXpert drives conversations to under $3$ turns with success rates exceeding 94\% and, with a larger LLM prior, pushes success above 97\% while markedly improving negotiation outcomes. This framework delivers real-time, strategic, and emotionally intelligent dialogue planning at scale. Code available atthis https URL

  Predicting user behavior is essential for intelligent assistant services, yet deep learning models often struggle to capture long-tailed behaviors. Large language models (LLMs), with their pretraining on vast corpora containing rich behavioral knowledge, offer promise. However, existing fine-tuning approaches tend to overfit to frequent ``anchor'' behaviors, reducing their ability to predict less common ``tail'' behaviors. In this paper, we introduce BehaviorLM, a progressive fine-tuning approach that addresses this issue. In the first stage, LLMs are fine-tuned on anchor behaviors while preserving general behavioral knowledge. In the second stage, fine-tuning uses a balanced subset of all behaviors based on sample difficulty to improve tail behavior predictions without sacrificing anchor performance. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that BehaviorLM robustly predicts both anchor and tail behaviors and effectively leverages LLM behavioral knowledge to master tail behavior prediction with few-shot examples.

  E-commerce platforms increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to detect illicit or misleading product content. However, these models remain vulnerable to evasive content: inputs (text or images) that superficially comply with platform policies while covertly conveying prohibited claims. Unlike traditional adversarial attacks that induce overt failures, evasive content exploits ambiguity and context, making it far harder to detect. Existing robustness benchmarks provide little guidance for this demanding, real-world challenge. We introduce EVADE, the first expert-curated, Chinese, multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate foundation models on evasive content detection in e-commerce. The dataset contains 2,833 annotated text samples and 13,961 images spanning six demanding product categories, including body shaping, height growth, and health supplements. Two complementary tasks assess distinct capabilities: Single-Violation, which probes fine-grained reasoning under short prompts, and All-in-One, which tests long-context reasoning by merging overlapping policy rules into unified instructions. Notably, the All-in-One setting significantly narrows the performance gap between partial and full-match accuracy, suggesting that clearer rule definitions improve alignment between human and model judgment. We benchmark 26 mainstream LLMs and VLMs and observe substantial performance gaps: even state-of-the-art models frequently misclassify evasive samples. By releasing EVADE and strong baselines, we provide the first rigorous standard for evaluating evasive-content detection, expose fundamental limitations in current multimodal reasoning, and lay the groundwork for safer and more transparent content moderation systems in e-commerce. The dataset is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong planning and decision-making capabilities in complex embodied environments. However, such agents often suffer from inefficiencies in multi-turn interactions, frequently trapped in repetitive loops or issuing ineffective commands, leading to redundant computational overhead. Instead of relying solely on learning from trajectories, we take a first step toward exploring the early-exit behavior for LLM-based agents. We propose two complementary approaches: 1. an $\textbf{intrinsic}$ method that injects exit instructions during generation, and 2. an $\textbf{extrinsic}$ method that verifies task completion to determine when to halt an agent's trial. To evaluate early-exit mechanisms, we introduce two metrics: one measures the reduction of $\textbf{redundant steps}$ as a positive effect, and the other evaluates $\textbf{progress degradation}$ as a negative effect. Experiments with 4 different LLMs across 5 embodied environments show significant efficiency improvements, with only minor drops in agent performance. We also validate a practical strategy where a stronger agent assists after an early-exit agent, achieving better performance with the same total steps. We will release our code to support further research.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but remain computationally expensive, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, recent works have focused on distilling reasoning capabilities into smaller language models (sLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from teacher LLMs. However, this approach struggles in scenarios requiring rare factual knowledge or precise computation, where sLMs often hallucinate due to limited capability. In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for transferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from LLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent distillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method called first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated trajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for improving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight reasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small as 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier larger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the potential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small agents.

  Aligning large language models (LLMs) to accurately detect hallucinations remains a significant challenge due to the sophisticated nature of hallucinated text. Recognizing that hallucinated samples typically exhibit higher deceptive quality than traditional negative samples, we use these carefully engineered hallucinations as negative examples in the DPO alignment procedure. Our method incorporates a curriculum learning strategy, gradually transitioning the training from easier samples, identified based on the greatest reduction in probability scores from independent fact checking models, to progressively harder ones. This structured difficulty scaling ensures stable and incremental learning. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our HaluCheck models, trained with curriculum DPO approach and high quality negative samples, significantly improves model performance across various metrics, achieving improvements of upto 24% on difficult benchmarks like MedHallu and HaluEval. Additionally, HaluCheck models demonstrate robustness in zero-shot settings, significantly outperforming larger state-of-the-art models across various benchmarks.

  Identification of hallucination spans in black-box language model generated text is essential for applications in the real world. A recent attempt at this direction is SemEval-2025 Task 3, Mu-SHROOM-a Multilingual Shared Task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Over-generation Errors. In this work, we present our solution to this problem, which capitalizes on the variability of stochastically-sampled responses in order to identify hallucinated spans. Our hypothesis is that if a language model is certain of a fact, its sampled responses will be uniform, while hallucinated facts will yield different and conflicting results. We measure this divergence through entropy-based analysis, allowing for accurate identification of hallucinated segments. Our method is not dependent on additional training and hence is cost-effective and adaptable. In addition, we conduct extensive hyperparameter tuning and perform error analysis, giving us crucial insights into model behavior.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt large language models (LLMs) to specific domains, a significant challenge arises: should we use the entire SFT dataset for fine-tuning? Common practice often involves fine-tuning directly on the entire dataset due to limited information on the LLM's past training data. However, if the SFT dataset largely overlaps with the model's existing knowledge, the performance gains are minimal, leading to wasted computational resources. Identifying the unknown knowledge within the SFT dataset and using it to fine-tune the model could substantially improve the training efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a self-learning framework for LLMs inspired by human learning pattern. This framework takes a fine-tuning (SFT) dataset in a specific domain as input. First, the LLMs answer the questions in the SFT dataset. The LLMs then objectively grade the responses and filter out the incorrectly answered QA pairs. Finally, we fine-tune the LLMs based on this filtered QA set. Experimental results in the fields of agriculture and medicine demonstrate that our method substantially reduces training time while achieving comparable improvements to those attained with full dataset fine-tuning. By concentrating on the unknown knowledge within the SFT dataset, our approach enhances the efficiency of fine-tuning LLMs.

  The conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest that they may be able to perform as automated talk therapists. It is crucial to know if these systems would be effective and adhere to known standards. We present a counsellor chatbot that focuses on motivating tobacco smokers to quit smoking. It uses a state-of-the-art LLM and a widely applied therapeutic approach called Motivational Interviewing (MI), and was evolved in collaboration with clinician-scientists with expertise in MI. We also describe and validate an automated assessment of both the chatbot's adherence to MI and client responses. The chatbot was tested on 106 participants, and their confidence that they could succeed in quitting smoking was measured before the conversation and one week later. Participants' confidence increased by an average of 1.7 on a 0-10 scale. The automated assessment of the chatbot showed adherence to MI standards in 98% of utterances, higher than human counsellors. The chatbot scored well on a participant-reported metric of perceived empathy but lower than typical human counsellors. Furthermore, participants' language indicated a good level of motivation to change, a key goal in MI. These results suggest that the automation of talk therapy with a modern LLM has promise.

  Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling dynamic, multi-step reasoning and information retrieval. However, these systems often exhibit sub-optimal search behaviors like over-search (retrieving redundant information) and under-search (failing to retrieve necessary information), which hinder efficiency and reliability. This work formally defines and quantifies these behaviors, revealing their prevalence across multiple QA datasets and agentic RAG systems (e.g., one model could have avoided searching in 27.7% of its search steps). Furthermore, we demonstrate a crucial link between these inefficiencies and the models' uncertainty regarding their own knowledge boundaries, where response accuracy correlates with model's uncertainty in its search decisions. To address this, we propose $\beta$-GRPO, a reinforcement learning-based training method that incorporates confidence threshold to reward high-certainty search decisions. Experiments on seven QA benchmarks show that $\beta$-GRPO enable a 3B model with better agentic RAG ability, outperforming other strong baselines with a 4% higher average exact match score.

  A practical approach to activate long chain-of-thoughts reasoning ability in pre-trained large language models is to perform supervised fine-tuning on instruction datasets synthesized by strong Large Reasoning Models such as DeepSeek-R1, offering a cost-effective alternative to reinforcement learning. However, large-scale instruction sets with more than 100k samples incur significant training overhead, while effective strategies for automatic long-CoT instruction selection still remain unexplored. In this work, we propose Select2Reason, a novel and efficient instruction-tuning data selection framework for long-CoT reasoning. From the perspective of emergence of rethinking behaviors like self-correction and backtracking, we investigate common metrics that may determine the quality of long-CoT reasoning instructions. Select2Reason leverages a quantifier to estimate difficulty of question and jointly incorporates a reasoning trace length-based heuristic through a weighted scheme for ranking to prioritize high-utility examples. Empirical results on OpenR1-Math-220k demonstrate that fine-tuning LLM on only 10% of the data selected by Select2Reason achieves performance competitive with or superior to full-data tuning and open-source baseline OpenR1-Qwen-7B across three competition-level and six comprehensive mathematical benchmarks. Further experiments highlight the scalability in varying data size, efficiency during inference, and its adaptability to other instruction pools with minimal cost.

  Rare diseases, including Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM), pose significant diagnostic challenges. Case reports serve as key but computationally underutilized resources to inform diagnosis. Clinical dense information extraction refers to organizing medical information into structured predefined categories. Large Language Models (LLMs) may enable scalable information extraction from case reports but are rarely evaluated for this task. We introduce CaseReportBench, an expert-annotated dataset for dense information extraction of case reports, focusing on IEMs. Using this dataset, we assess various models and prompting strategies, introducing novel approaches such as category-specific prompting and subheading-filtered data integration. Zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting offers little advantage over standard zero-shot prompting. Category-specific prompting improves alignment with the benchmark. The open-source model Qwen2.5-7B outperforms GPT-4o for this task. Our clinician evaluations show that LLMs can extract clinically relevant details from case reports, supporting rare disease diagnosis and management. We also highlight areas for improvement, such as LLMs' limitations in recognizing negative findings important for differential diagnosis. This work advances LLM-driven clinical natural language processing and paves the way for scalable medical AI applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The performance of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems relies heavily on the retriever quality and the size of the retrieved context. A large enough context ensures that the relevant information is present in the input context for the LLM, but also incorporates irrelevant content that has been shown to confuse the models. On the other hand, a smaller context reduces the irrelevant information, but it often comes at the risk of losing important information necessary to answer the input question. This duality is especially challenging to manage for complex queries that contain little information to retrieve the relevant chunks from the full context. To address this, we present a novel framework, called FB-RAG, which enhances the RAG pipeline by relying on a combination of backward lookup (overlap with the query) and forward lookup (overlap with candidate reasons and answers) to retrieve specific context chunks that are the most relevant for answering the input query. Our evaluations on 9 datasets from two leading benchmarks show that FB-RAG consistently outperforms RAG and Long Context baselines developed recently for these benchmarks. We further show that FB-RAG can improve performance while reducing latency.

  Autoregressive pretraining has become the de facto paradigm for learning general-purpose representations in large language models (LLMs). However, linear probe performance across downstream perception tasks shows substantial variability, suggesting that features optimized for next-token prediction do not consistently transfer well to downstream perception tasks. We demonstrate that representations learned via autoregression capture features that may lie outside the subspaces most informative for perception. To quantify the (mis)alignment between autoregressive pretraining and downstream perception, we introduce the Next Token Perception Score (NTPS)-a score derived under a linear setting that measures the overlap between autoregressive and perception feature subspaces. This metric can be easily computed in closed form from pretrained representations and labeled data, and is proven to both upper- and lower-bound the excess loss. Empirically, we show that NTPS correlates strongly with linear probe accuracy across 12 diverse NLP datasets and eight pretrained models ranging from 270M to 8B parameters, confirming its utility as a measure of alignment. Furthermore, we show that NTPS increases following low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, especially in large models, suggesting that LoRA aligning representations to perception tasks enhances subspace overlap and thus improves downstream performance. More importantly, we find that NTPS reliably predicts the additional accuracy gains attained by LoRA finetuning thereby providing a lightweight prescreening tool for LoRA adaptation. Our results offer both theoretical insights and practical tools for analytically assessing LLM perception skills.

  Recently, models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) reasoning. Although distilling this capability into student models significantly enhances their performance, this paper finds that fine-tuning LLMs with full parameters or LoRA with a low rank on long CoT data often leads to Cyclical Reasoning, where models repeatedly reiterate previous inference steps until the maximum length limit. Further analysis reveals that smaller differences in representations between adjacent tokens correlates with a higher tendency toward Cyclical Reasoning. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes Shift Feedforward Networks (Shift-FFN), a novel approach that edits the current token's representation with the previous one before inputting it to FFN. This architecture dynamically amplifies the representation differences between adjacent tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that LoRA combined with Shift-FFN achieves higher accuracy and a lower rate of Cyclical Reasoning across various data sizes compared to full fine-tuning and standard LoRA.

  With the rise of different language model architecture, fine-tuning is becoming even more important for down stream tasks Model gets messy, finding proper hyperparameters for fine-tuning. Although BO has been tried for hyperparameter tuning, most of the existing methods are oblivious to the fact that BO relies on careful choices of acquisition functions, which are essential components of BO that guide how much to explore versus exploit during the optimization process; Different acquisition functions have different levels of sensitivity towards training loss and validation performance; existing methods often just apply an acquisition function no matter if the training and validation performance are sensitive to the acquisition function or not. This work introduces{Bilevel - BO - SWA}, a model fusion approach coupled with a bilevel BO strategy to improve the fine - tunning of large language models. Our work on mixture of acquisition functions like EI and UCB into nested opt loops, where inner loop perform minimization of training loss while outer loops optimized w.r.t. val metric. Experiments on GLUE tasks using RoBERTA - base show that when using EI and UCB, there is an improvement in generalization, and fine - tuning can be improved by up to 2.7%.

  Predictive analysis is a cornerstone of modern decision-making, with applications in various domains. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in enabling nuanced, knowledge-intensive conversations, thus aiding in complex decision-making tasks. With the burgeoning expectation to harness LLMs for predictive analysis, there is an urgent need to systematically assess their capability in this domain. However, there is a lack of relevant evaluations in existing studies. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \textbf{PredictiQ} benchmark, which integrates 1130 sophisticated predictive analysis queries originating from 44 real-world datasets of 8 diverse fields. We design an evaluation protocol considering text analysis, code generation, and their alignment. Twelve renowned LLMs are evaluated, offering insights into their practical use in predictive analysis. Generally, we believe that existing LLMs still face considerable challenges in conducting predictive analysis. See \href{this https URL}{Github}.

  Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) drive interest in scientific applications, necessitating specialized benchmarks such as Earth science. Existing benchmarks either present a general science focus devoid of Earth science specificity or cover isolated subdomains, lacking holistic evaluation. Furthermore, current benchmarks typically neglect the assessment of LLMs' capabilities in open-ended scientific exploration. In this paper, we present a comprehensive and professional benchmark for the Earth sciences, designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in scientific exploration within this domain, spanning from fundamental to advanced levels. Leveraging a corpus of 100,000 research papers, we first construct two Question Answering (QA) datasets: Earth-Iron, which offers extensive question coverage for broad assessment, and Earth-Silver, which features a higher level of difficulty to evaluate professional depth. These datasets encompass five Earth spheres, 114 disciplines, and 11 task categories, assessing foundational knowledge crucial for scientific exploration. Most notably, we introduce Earth-Gold with new metrics, a dataset comprising open-ended multi-turn dialogues specifically designed to evaluate the advanced capabilities of LLMs in scientific exploration, including methodology induction, limitation analysis, and concept proposal. Extensive experiments reveal limitations in 11 leading LLMs across different domains and tasks, highlighting considerable room for improvement in their scientific exploration capabilities.

  Early detection of cognitive decline is crucial for enabling interventions that can slow neurodegenerative disease progression. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on labor-intensive clinical assessments, which are impractical for frequent monitoring. Our pilot study investigates voice assistant systems (VAS) as non-invasive tools for detecting cognitive decline through longitudinal analysis of speech patterns in voice commands. Over an 18-month period, we collected voice commands from 35 older adults, with 15 participants providing daily at-home VAS interactions. To address the challenges of analyzing these short, unstructured and noisy commands, we propose Cog-TiPRO, a framework that combines (1) LLM-driven iterative prompt refinement for linguistic feature extraction, (2) HuBERT-based acoustic feature extraction, and (3) transformer-based temporal modeling. Using iTransformer, our approach achieves 73.80% accuracy and 72.67% F1-score in detecting MCI, outperforming its baseline by 27.13%. Through our LLM approach, we identify linguistic features that uniquely characterize everyday command usage patterns in individuals experiencing cognitive decline.

  Applying AI foundation models directly to geospatial datasets remains challenging due to their limited ability to represent and reason with geographical entities, specifically vector-based geometries and natural language descriptions of complex spatial relations. To address these issues, we investigate the extent to which a well-known-text (WKT) representation of geometries and their spatial relations (e.g., topological predicates) are preserved during spatial reasoning when the geospatial vector data are passed to large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and DeepSeek-R1-14B. Our workflow employs three distinct approaches to complete the spatial reasoning tasks for comparison, i.e., geometry embedding-based, prompt engineering-based, and everyday language-based evaluation. Our experiment results demonstrate that both the embedding-based and prompt engineering-based approaches to geospatial question-answering tasks with GPT models can achieve an accuracy of over 0.6 on average for the identification of topological spatial relations between two geometries. Among the evaluated models, GPT-4 with few-shot prompting achieved the highest performance with over 0.66 accuracy on topological spatial relation inference. Additionally, GPT-based reasoner is capable of properly comprehending inverse topological spatial relations and including an LLM-generated geometry can enhance the effectiveness for geographic entity retrieval. GPT-4 also exhibits the ability to translate certain vernacular descriptions about places into formal topological relations, and adding the geometry-type or place-type context in prompts may improve inference accuracy, but it varies by instance. The performance of these spatial reasoning tasks offers valuable insights for the refinement of LLMs with geographical knowledge towards the development of geo-foundation models capable of geospatial reasoning.

  High-quality long-context instruction data is essential for aligning long-context large language models (LLMs). Despite the public release of models like Qwen and Llama, their long-context instruction data remains proprietary. Human annotation is costly and challenging, while template-based synthesis methods limit scale, diversity, and quality. We introduce LongMagpie, a self-synthesis framework that automatically generates large-scale long-context instruction data. Our key insight is that aligned long-context LLMs, when presented with a document followed by special tokens preceding a user turn, auto-regressively generate contextually relevant queries. By harvesting these document-query pairs and the model's responses, LongMagpie produces high-quality instructions without human effort. Experiments on HELMET, RULER, and Longbench v2 demonstrate that LongMagpie achieves leading performance on long-context tasks while maintaining competitive performance on short-context tasks, establishing it as a simple and effective approach for open, diverse, and scalable long-context instruction data synthesis.

  Obtaining large-scale, high-quality data with reasoning paths is crucial for improving the geometric reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing data generation methods, whether based on predefined templates or constrained symbolic provers, inevitably face diversity and numerical generalization limitations. To address these limitations, we propose NeSyGeo, a novel neuro-symbolic framework for generating geometric reasoning data. First, we propose a domain-specific language grounded in the entity-relation-constraint paradigm to comprehensively represent all components of plane geometry, along with generative actions defined within this symbolic space. We then design a symbolic-visual-text pipeline that synthesizes symbolic sequences, maps them to corresponding visual and textual representations, and generates diverse question-answer (Q&A) pairs using large language models (LLMs). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a neuro-symbolic approach in generating multimodal reasoning data. Based on this framework, we construct NeSyGeo-CoT and NeSyGeo-Caption datasets, containing 100k samples, and release a new benchmark NeSyGeo-Test for evaluating geometric reasoning abilities in MLLMs. Experiments demonstrate that the proposal significantly and consistently improves the performance of multiple MLLMs under both reinforcement and supervised fine-tuning. With only 4k samples and two epochs of reinforcement fine-tuning, base models achieve improvements of up to +15.8% on MathVision, +8.4% on MathVerse, and +7.3% on GeoQA. Notably, a 4B model can be improved to outperform an 8B model from the same series on geometric reasoning tasks.

  SDForger is a flexible and efficient framework for generating high-quality multivariate time series using LLMs. Leveraging a compact data representation, SDForger provides synthetic time series generation from a few samples and low-computation fine-tuning of any autoregressive LLM. Specifically, the framework transforms univariate and multivariate signals into tabular embeddings, which are then encoded into text and used to fine-tune the LLM. At inference, new textual embeddings are sampled and decoded into synthetic time series that retain the original data's statistical properties and temporal dynamics. Across a diverse range of datasets, SDForger outperforms existing generative models in many scenarios, both in similarity-based evaluations and downstream forecasting tasks. By enabling textual conditioning in the generation process, SDForger paves the way for multimodal modeling and the streamlined integration of time series with textual information. SDForger source code will be open-sourced soon.

  Open-source large language models (LLMs) still marginalise Moroccan Arabic (Darija), forcing practitioners either to bolt on heavyweight Arabic adapters or to sacrifice the very reasoning skills that make LLMs useful. We show that a rigorously quality-over-quantity alignment strategy can surface fluent Darija while safeguarding the backbone s cross-lingual reasoning at a sliver of the usual compute. We translate three compact instruction suites LIMA 1 K, DEITA 6 K and TULU 50 K into Darija, preserve 20 of the English originals, and add mathematics, coding and scientific prompts. A LoRA-tuned Gemma 3-4B trained on 5 K mixed instructions lifts DarijaMMLU from 32.8 to 42.7 ; adding the reasoning-dense TULU portion pushes it to 47.5 with no English regression. Scaling the identical recipe to Gemma 3-27B produces GemMaroc-27B, which matches Atlas-Chat on DarijaMMLU (61.6 ) and leaps ahead on Darija commonsense, scoring 60.5 on HellaSwag versus Atlas-Chat s 48.4 . Crucially, GemMaroc retains Gemma-27B s strong maths and general-reasoning ability, showing only minimal movement on GSM8K and English benchmarks. The entire model is trained in just 48 GPU.h, underscoring a Green AI pathway to inclusive, sustainable language technology. We release code, data and checkpoints to spur Darija-centric applications in education, public services and everyday digital interaction.

  This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of toxicity generation in Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes an effective detoxification approach. Prior work typically considers the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) as the main source of toxicity, representing toxic regions as a set of toxic vectors or layer-wise subspaces. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that the global toxic subspace offers a more effective and comprehensive representation of toxic region within the model. Building on this insight, we propose GloSS (Global Toxic Subspace Suppression), a lightweight, four-stage method that mitigates toxicity by identifying and removing the global toxic subspace from the parameters of FFN. Experiments across a range of LLMs show that GloSS achieves state-of-the-art detoxification performance while preserving the models general capabilities, without requiring large-scale data or model retraining.

  In order to enable fluid and natural human-machine speech interaction, existing full-duplex conversational systems often adopt modular architectures with auxiliary components such as voice activity detectors, interrupters, conversation state predictors, or multiple LLMs. These systems, however, suffer from error accumulation across modules and struggle with key challenges such as context-dependent barge-in and echo cancellation. Recent approaches, most notably Moshi, simplify the pipeline by injecting audio codecs into the token space of a single LLM. However, such methods still incur significant performance degradation when operating on the speech rather than text modality. In this paper, we introduce SALMONN-omni, the first single, standalone full-duplex speech LLM that operates without audio codecs in its token space. It features a novel dynamic thinking mechanism within the LLM backbone, enabling the model to learn when to transition between speaking and listening states. Experiments on widely used benchmarks for spoken question answering and open-domain dialogue show that SALMONN-omni achieves at least 30\% relative performance improvement over existing open-source full-duplex models and performs highly competitively to half-duplex and turn-based systems, despite using substantially less training data. Moreover, SALMONN-omni demonstrates strong performance in complex conversational scenarios, including turn-taking, backchanneling, echo cancellation and context-dependent barge-in, with further improvements achieved through reinforcement learning. Some demo conversations between user and SALMONN-omni are provided in the following repositorythis https URL.

  AI is transforming education by enabling powerful tools that enhance learning experiences. Among recent advancements, large language models (LLMs) hold particular promise for revolutionizing how learners interact with educational content. In this work, we investigate the potential of LLMs to support standardized test preparation by focusing on English Standardized Tests (ESTs). Specifically, we assess their ability to generate accurate and contextually appropriate solutions across a diverse set of EST question types. We introduce ESTBOOK, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in solving EST questions. ESTBOOK aggregates five widely recognized tests, encompassing 29 question types and over 10,576 questions across multiple modalities, including text, images, audio, tables, and mathematical symbols. Using ESTBOOK, we systematically evaluate both the accuracy and inference efficiency of LLMs. Additionally, we propose a breakdown analysis framework that decomposes complex EST questions into task-specific solution steps. This framework allows us to isolate and assess LLM performance at each stage of the reasoning process. Evaluation findings offer insights into the capability of LLMs in educational contexts and point toward targeted strategies for improving their reliability as intelligent tutoring systems.

  While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding human languages, this study explores how they translate this understanding into social exchange contexts that capture certain essences of real world human interactions. Three LLMs - ChatGPT-4, Claude, and Bard - were placed in economic trust games where players balance self-interest with trust and reciprocity, making decisions that reveal their social preferences and interactive reasoning abilities. Our study shows that LLMs deviate from pure self-interest and exhibit trust and reciprocity even without being prompted to adopt a specific persona. In the simplest one-shot interaction, LLMs emulated how human players place trust at the beginning of such a game. Larger human-machine divergences emerged in scenarios involving trust repayment or multi-round interactions, where decisions were influenced by both social preferences and interactive reasoning. LLMs responses varied significantly when prompted to adopt personas like selfish or unselfish players, with the impact outweighing differences between models or game types. Response of ChatGPT-4, in an unselfish or neutral persona, resembled the highest trust and reciprocity, surpassing humans, Claude, and Bard. Claude and Bard displayed trust and reciprocity levels that sometimes exceeded and sometimes fell below human choices. When given selfish personas, all LLMs showed lower trust and reciprocity than humans. Interactive reasoning to the actions of counterparts or changing game mechanics appeared to be random rather than stable, reproducible characteristics in the response of LLMs, though some improvements were observed when ChatGPT-4 responded in selfish or unselfish personas.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating contextually relevant content. However, tailoring these outputs to individual users for effective personalization is a significant challenge. While rich user-specific information often exists as pre-existing user representations, such as embeddings learned from preferences or behaviors, current methods to leverage these for LLM personalization typically require costly fine-tuning or token-heavy prompting. We propose Embedding-to-Prefix (E2P), a parameter-efficient method that injects pre-computed context embeddings into an LLM's hidden representation space through a learned projection to a single soft token prefix. This enables effective personalization while keeping the backbone model frozen and avoiding expensive adaptation techniques. We evaluate E2P across two public datasets and in a production setting: dialogue personalization on Persona-Chat, contextual headline generation on PENS, and large-scale personalization for music and podcast consumption. Results show that E2P preserves contextual signals and achieves strong performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable, efficient solution for contextualizing generative AI systems.

  In medical practices across the United States, physicians have begun implementing generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools to perform the function of scribes in order to reduce the burden of documenting clinical encounters. Despite their widespread use, no established methods exist to gauge the quality of AI scribes. To address this gap, we developed a blinded study comparing the relative performance of large language model (LLM) generated clinical notes with those from field experts based on audio-recorded clinical encounters. Quantitative metrics from the Physician Documentation Quality Instrument (PDQI9) provided a framework to measure note quality, which we adapted to assess relative performance of AI generated notes. Clinical experts spanning 5 medical specialties used the PDQI9 tool to evaluate specialist-drafted Gold notes and LLM authored Ambient notes. Two evaluators from each specialty scored notes drafted from a total of 97 patient visits. We found uniformly high inter rater agreement (RWG greater than 0.7) between evaluators in general medicine, orthopedics, and obstetrics and gynecology, and moderate (RWG 0.5 to 0.7) to high inter rater agreement in pediatrics and cardiology. We found a modest yet significant difference in the overall note quality, wherein Gold notes achieved a score of 4.25 out of 5 and Ambient notes scored 4.20 out of 5 (p = 0.04). Our findings support the use of the PDQI9 instrument as a practical method to gauge the quality of LLM authored notes, as compared to human-authored notes.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite significant progress, recent studies indicate that current large language models (LLMs) may still capture dataset biases and utilize them during inference, leading to the poor generalizability of LLMs. However, due to the diversity of dataset biases and the insufficient nature of bias suppression based on in-context learning, the effectiveness of previous prior knowledge-based debiasing methods and in-context learning based automatic debiasing methods is limited. To address these challenges, we explore the combination of causal mechanisms with information theory and propose an information gain-guided causal intervention debiasing (ICD) framework. To eliminate biases within the instruction-tuning dataset, it is essential to ensure that these biases do not provide any additional information to predict the answers, i.e., the information gain of these biases for predicting the answers needs to be 0. Under this guidance, this framework utilizes a causal intervention-based data rewriting method to automatically and autonomously balance the distribution of instruction-tuning dataset for reducing the information gain. Subsequently, it employs a standard supervised fine-tuning process to train LLMs on the debiased dataset. Experimental results show that ICD can effectively debias LLM to improve its generalizability across different tasks.

Unlike existing contrastive decoding methods, HICD selects attention heads crucial to the model's prediction as inducing heads, then induces hallucinations by dispersing attention of these inducing heads and compares the hallucinated outputs with the original outputs to obtain the final result. Our approach significantly improves performance on tasks requiring contextual faithfulness, such as context completion, reading comprehension, and question answering. It also improves factuality in tasks requiring accurate knowledge recall. We demonstrate that our inducing heads selection and attention dispersion method leads to more "contrast-effective" hallucinations for contrastive decoding, outperforming other hallucination-inducing methods. Our findings provide a promising strategy for reducing hallucinations by inducing hallucinations in a controlled manner, enhancing the performance of LLMs in a wide range of tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A safe and trustworthy use of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires an accurate expression of confidence in their answers. We propose a novel Reinforcement Learning approach that allows to directly fine-tune LLMs to express calibrated confidence estimates alongside their answers to factual questions. Our method optimizes a reward based on the logarithmic scoring rule, explicitly penalizing both over- and under-confidence. This encourages the model to align its confidence estimates with the actual predictive accuracy. The optimal policy under our reward design would result in perfectly calibrated confidence expressions. Unlike prior approaches that decouple confidence estimation from response generation, our method integrates confidence calibration seamlessly into the generative process of the LLM. Empirically, we demonstrate that models trained with our approach exhibit substantially improved calibration and generalize to unseen tasks without further fine-tuning, suggesting the emergence of general confidence awareness. We provide our training and evaluation code in the supplementary and will make it publicly available upon acceptance.

  Peer review is a critical process for ensuring the integrity of published scientific research. Confidence in this process is predicated on the assumption that experts in the relevant domain give careful consideration to the merits of manuscripts which are submitted for publication. With the recent rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), a new risk to the peer review process is that negligent reviewers will rely on LLMs to perform the often time consuming process of reviewing a paper. However, there is a lack of existing resources for benchmarking the detectability of AI text in the domain of peer review. To address this deficiency, we introduce a comprehensive dataset containing a total of 788,984 AI-written peer reviews paired with corresponding human reviews, covering 8 years of papers submitted to each of two leading AI research conferences (ICLR and NeurIPS). We use this new resource to evaluate the ability of 18 existing AI text detection algorithms to distinguish between peer reviews fully written by humans and different state-of-the-art LLMs. Additionally, we explore a context-aware detection method called Anchor, which leverages manuscript content to detect AI-generated reviews, and analyze the sensitivity of detection models to LLM-assisted editing of human-written text. Our work reveals the difficulty of identifying AI-generated text at the individual peer review level, highlighting the urgent need for new tools and methods to detect this unethical use of generative AI. Our dataset is publicly available at:this https URL.

  Visual programming languages (VPLs) allow users to create programs through graphical interfaces, which results in easier accessibility and their widespread usage in various domains. To further enhance this accessibility, recent research has focused on generating VPL code from user instructions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by employing prompting-based methods, these studies have shown promising results. Nevertheless, such approaches can be less effective for industrial VPLs such as Ladder Diagram (LD). LD is a pivotal language used in industrial automation processes and involves extensive domain-specific configurations, which are difficult to capture in a single prompt. In this work, we demonstrate that training-based methods outperform prompting-based methods for LD generation accuracy, even with smaller backbone models. Building on these findings, we propose a two-stage training strategy to further enhance VPL generation. First, we employ retrieval-augmented fine-tuning to leverage the repetitive use of subroutines commonly seen in industrial VPLs. Second, we apply direct preference optimization (DPO) to further guide the model toward accurate outputs, using systematically generated preference pairs through graph editing operations. Extensive experiments on real-world LD data demonstrate that our approach improves program-level accuracy by over 10% compared to supervised fine-tuning, which highlights its potential to advance industrial automation.

  Knowledge editing allows for efficient adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to new information or corrections without requiring full retraining. However, prior methods typically focus on either single-language editing or basic multilingual editing, failing to achieve true cross-linguistic knowledge synchronization. To address this, we present a simple and practical state-of-the-art (SOTA) recipe Cross-Lingual Knowledge Democracy Edit (X-KDE), designed to propagate knowledge from a dominant language to other languages effectively. Our X-KDE comprises two stages: (i) Cross-lingual Edition Instruction Tuning (XE-IT), which fine-tunes the model on a curated parallel dataset to modify in-scope knowledge while preserving unrelated information, and (ii) Target-language Preference Optimization (TL-PO), which applies advanced optimization techniques to ensure consistency across languages, fostering the transfer of updates. Additionally, we contribute a high-quality, cross-lingual dataset, specifically designed to enhance knowledge transfer across languages. Extensive experiments on the Bi-ZsRE and MzsRE benchmarks show that X-KDE significantly enhances cross-lingual performance, achieving an average improvement of +8.19%, while maintaining high accuracy in monolingual settings.

  Prior studies have shown that distinguishing text generated by large language models (LLMs) from human-written one is highly challenging, and often no better than random guessing. To verify the generalizability of this finding across languages and domains, we perform an extensive case study to identify the upper bound of human detection accuracy. Across 16 datasets covering 9 languages and 9 domains, 19 annotators achieved an average detection accuracy of 87.6\%, thus challenging previous conclusions. We find that major gaps between human and machine text lie in concreteness, cultural nuances, and diversity. Prompting by explicitly explaining the distinctions in the prompts can partially bridge the gaps in over 50\% of the cases. However, we also find that humans do not always prefer human-written text, particularly when they cannot clearly identify its source.

  System messages play a crucial role in interactions with large language models (LLMs), often serving as prompts to initiate conversations. Through system messages, users can assign specific roles, perform intended tasks, incorporate background information, and specify various output formats and communication styles. Despite such versatility, publicly available datasets often lack system messages and are subject to strict license constraints in industrial applications. Moreover, manually annotating system messages that align with user instructions is resource-intensive. In light of these challenges, we introduce SysGen, a pipeline for generating system messages that better align assistant responses with user instructions using existing supervised fine-tuning datasets that lack system messages. Training open-source models on SysGen data yields substantial improvements in both single-turn (Multifacet) and multi-turn (SysBench) conversation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows strong gains in shorter conversations, suggesting that it enhances early-stage interaction effectiveness. Our qualitative analysis further emphasizes the value of diverse and structured system messages in improving LLM adaptability across varied user scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) for domain-specific question-answering (QA) tasks by leveraging external knowledge sources. However, traditional RAG systems primarily focus on relevance-based retrieval and often struggle with redundancy, especially when reasoning requires connecting information from multiple sources. This paper introduces Vendi-RAG, a framework based on an iterative process that jointly optimizes retrieval diversity and answer quality. This joint optimization leads to significantly higher accuracy for multi-hop QA tasks. Vendi-RAG leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible similarity-based diversity metric, to promote semantic diversity in document retrieval. It then uses an LLM judge that evaluates candidate answers, generated after a reasoning step, and outputs a score that the retriever uses to balance relevance and diversity among the retrieved documents during each iteration. Experiments on three challenging datasets -- HotpotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA -- demonstrate Vendi-RAG's effectiveness in multi-hop reasoning tasks. The framework achieves significant accuracy improvements over traditional single-step and multi-step RAG approaches, with accuracy increases reaching up to +4.2% on HotpotQA, +4.1% on 2WikiMultiHopQA, and +1.3% on MuSiQue compared to Adaptive-RAG, the current best baseline. The benefits of Vendi-RAG are even more pronounced as the number of retrieved documents increases. Finally, we evaluated Vendi-RAG across different LLM backbones, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o-mini, and observed consistent improvements, demonstrating that the framework's advantages are model-agnostic.

  While most current approaches rely on further training techniques, such as fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, to enhance model capacities, model merging stands out for its ability of improving models without requiring any additional training. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for model merging based on low-rank estimation of task vectors without the need for access to the base model, named \textsc{LoRE-Merging}. Our approach is motivated by the observation that task vectors from fine-tuned models frequently exhibit a limited number of dominant singular values, making low-rank estimations less prone to interference. We implement the method by formulating the merging problem as an optimization problem. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in mitigating interference and preserving task-specific information, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art performance in model merging techniques.

  Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has gained interest in speech-text multimodal foundation models, achieving strong performance on instruction-tuned speech translation (ST). However, expanding language pairs is costly due to re-training on combined new and previous datasets. To address this, we aim to build a one-to-many ST system from existing one-to-one ST systems using task arithmetic without re-training. Direct application of task arithmetic in ST leads to language confusion; therefore, we introduce an augmented task arithmetic method incorporating a language control model to ensure correct target language generation. Our experiments on MuST-C and CoVoST-2 show BLEU score improvements of up to 4.66 and 4.92, with COMET gains of 8.87 and 11.83. In addition, we demonstrate our framework can extend to language pairs lacking paired ST training data or pre-trained ST models by synthesizing ST models based on existing machine translation (MT) and ST models via task analogies.

  This study addresses a critical gap in safety tuning practices for Large Language Models (LLMs) by identifying and tackling a refusal position bias within safety tuning data, which compromises the models' ability to appropriately refuse generating unsafe content. We introduce a novel approach, Decoupled Refusal Training (DeRTa), designed to empower LLMs to refuse compliance to harmful prompts at any response position, significantly enhancing their safety capabilities. DeRTa incorporates two novel components: (1) Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with Harmful Response Prefix, which trains models to recognize and avoid unsafe content by appending a segment of harmful response to the beginning of a safe response, and (2) Reinforced Transition Optimization (RTO), which equips models with the ability to transition from potential harm to safety refusal consistently throughout the harmful response sequence. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using LLaMA3 and Mistral model families across six attack scenarios, demonstrates that our method not only improves model safety without compromising performance but also surpasses baseline methods in defending against attacks.

  _Yue Zhou, Henry Peng Zou, Barbara Di Eugenio, Yang Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We find that language models have difficulties generating fallacious and deceptive reasoning. When asked to generate deceptive outputs, language models tend to leak honest counterparts but believe them to be false. Exploiting this deficiency, we propose a jailbreak attack method that elicits an aligned language model for malicious output. Specifically, we query the model to generate a fallacious yet deceptively real procedure for the harmful behavior. Since a fallacious procedure is generally considered fake and thus harmless by LLMs, it helps bypass the safeguard mechanism. Yet the output is factually harmful since the LLM cannot fabricate fallacious solutions but proposes truthful ones. We evaluate our approach over five safety-aligned large language models, comparing four previous jailbreak methods, and show that our approach achieves competitive performance with more harmful outputs. We believe the findings could be extended beyond model safety, such as self-verification and hallucination.

  Arabic poetry stands as one of the most sophisticated and culturally embedded forms of expression in the Arabic language, known for its layered meanings, stylistic diversity, and deep historical continuity. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across languages and tasks, their ability to understand Arabic poetry remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce `Fann or Flop`, the first benchmark designed to assess the comprehension of Arabic poetry by LLMs in twelve historical eras, covering 21 core poetic genres and a variety of metrical forms, from classical structures to contemporary free verse. The benchmark comprises a curated corpus of poems with explanations that assess semantic understanding, metaphor interpretation, prosodic awareness, and cultural context. We argue that poetic comprehension offers a strong indicator for testing how good the LLM is in understanding classical Arabic through the Arabic poetry. Unlike surface-level tasks, this domain demands deeper interpretive reasoning and cultural sensitivity. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs shows that most models struggle with poetic understanding despite strong results on standard Arabic benchmarks. We release `Fann or Flop` along with the evaluation suite as an open-source resource to enable rigorous evaluation and advancement for Arabic language models. Code is available at:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time scaling (TTS), which involves dynamic allocation of compute during inference, offers a promising way to improve reasoning in large language models. While existing TTS methods work well, they often rely on long decoding paths or require a large number of samples to be generated, increasing the token usage and inference latency. We observe the surprising fact that for reasoning tasks, shorter traces are much more likely to be correct than longer ones. Motivated by this, we introduce First Finish Search (FFS), a training-free parallel decoding strategy that launches $n$ independent samples and returns as soon as any one completes. We evaluate FFS alongside simple decoding, beam search, majority voting, and budget forcing on four reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1, R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, QwQ-32B and Phi-4-Reasoning-Plus) and across four datasets (AIME24, AIME25-I, AIME25-II and GPQA Diamond). With DeepSeek-R1, FFS achieves $82.23\%$ accuracy on the AIME datasets, a $15\%$ improvement over DeepSeek-R1's standalone accuracy, nearly matching OpenAI's o4-mini performance. Our theoretical analysis explains why stopping at the shortest trace is likely to yield a correct answer and identifies the conditions under which early stopping may be suboptimal. The elegance and simplicity of FFS demonstrate that straightforward TTS strategies can perform remarkably well, revealing the untapped potential of simple approaches at inference time.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Frankentexts, a new type of long-form narratives produced by LLMs under the extreme constraint that most tokens (e.g., 90%) must be copied verbatim from human writings. This task presents a challenging test of controllable generation, requiring models to satisfy a writing prompt, integrate disparate text fragments, and still produce a coherent narrative. To generate Frankentexts, we instruct the model to produce a draft by selecting and combining human-written passages, then iteratively revise the draft while maintaining a user-specified copy ratio. We evaluate the resulting Frankentexts along three axes: writing quality, instruction adherence, and detectability. Gemini-2.5-Pro performs surprisingly well on this task: 81% of its Frankentexts are coherent and 100% relevant to the prompt. Notably, up to 59% of these outputs are misclassified as human-written by detectors like Pangram, revealing limitations in AI text detectors. Human annotators can sometimes identify Frankentexts through their abrupt tone shifts and inconsistent grammar between segments, especially in longer generations. Beyond presenting a challenging generation task, Frankentexts invite discussion on building effective detectors for this new grey zone of authorship, provide training data for mixed authorship detection, and serve as a sandbox for studying human-AI co-writing processes.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved Text-to-SQL performance for single-table queries. But, it remains challenging in multi-table databases due to complex schema and relational operations. Existing methods often struggle with retrieving the right tables and columns, generating accurate JOINs and UNIONs, and generalizing across diverse schemas. To address these issues, we introduce UNJOIN, a two-stage framework that decouples the retrieval of schema elements from SQL logic generation. In the first stage, we merge the column names of all tables in the database into a single-table representation by prefixing each column with its table name. This allows the model to focus purely on accurate retrieval without being distracted by the need to write complex SQL logic. In the second stage, the SQL query is generated on this simplified schema and mapped back to the original schema by reconstructing JOINs, UNIONs, and relational logic. Evaluations on SPIDER and BIRD datasets show that UNJOIN matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art baselines. UNJOIN uses only schema information, which does not require data access or fine-tuning, making it scalable and adaptable across databases.

  Humans naturally understand moments in a video by integrating visual and auditory cues. For example, localizing a scene in the video like "A scientist passionately speaks on wildlife conservation as dramatic orchestral music plays, with the audience nodding and applauding" requires simultaneous processing of visual, audio, and speech signals. However, existing models often struggle to effectively fuse and interpret audio information, limiting their capacity for comprehensive video temporal understanding. To address this, we present TriSense, a triple-modality large language model designed for holistic video temporal understanding through the integration of visual, audio, and speech modalities. Central to TriSense is a Query-Based Connector that adaptively reweights modality contributions based on the input query, enabling robust performance under modality dropout and allowing flexible combinations of available inputs. To support TriSense's multimodal capabilities, we introduce TriSense-2M, a high-quality dataset of over 2 million curated samples generated via an automated pipeline powered by fine-tuned LLMs. TriSense-2M includes long-form videos and diverse modality combinations, facilitating broad generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TriSense and its potential to advance multimodal video analysis. Code and dataset will be publicly released.

  Recent advances in web-augmented large language models (LLMs) have exhibited strong performance in complex reasoning tasks, yet these capabilities are mostly locked in proprietary systems with opaque architectures. In this work, we propose \textbf{ManuSearch}, a transparent and modular multi-agent framework designed to democratize deep search for LLMs. ManuSearch decomposes the search and reasoning process into three collaborative agents: (1) a solution planning agent that iteratively formulates sub-queries, (2) an Internet search agent that retrieves relevant documents via real-time web search, and (3) a structured webpage reading agent that extracts key evidence from raw web content. To rigorously evaluate deep reasoning abilities, we introduce \textbf{ORION}, a challenging benchmark focused on open-web reasoning over long-tail entities, covering both English and Chinese. Experimental results show that ManuSearch substantially outperforms prior open-source baselines and even surpasses leading closed-source systems. Our work paves the way for reproducible, extensible research in open deep search systems. We release the data and code inthis https URL

  This technical report presents QwenLong-CPRS, a context compression framework designed for explicit long-context optimization, addressing prohibitive computation overhead during the prefill stage and the "lost in the middle" performance degradation of large language models (LLMs) during long sequence processing. Implemented through a novel dynamic context optimization mechanism, QwenLong-CPRS enables multi-granularity context compression guided by natural language instructions, achieving both efficiency gains and improved performance.Evolved from the Qwen architecture series, QwenLong-CPRS introduces four key innovations: (1) Natural language-guided dynamic optimization, (2) Bidirectional reasoning layers for enhanced boundary awareness, (3) Token critic mechanisms with language modeling heads, and (4) Window-parallel inference.Comprehensive evaluations across five benchmarks (4K-2M word contexts) demonstrate QwenLong-CPRS's threefold effectiveness: (1) Consistent superiority over other context management methods like RAG and sparse attention in both accuracy and efficiency. (2) Architecture-agnostic integration with all flagship LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini2.0-pro, Claude3.7-sonnet, DeepSeek-v3, and Qwen2.5-max, achieves 21.59$\times$ context compression alongside 19.15-point average performance gains; (3) Deployed with Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, QwenLong-CPRS surpasses leading proprietary LLMs by 4.85 and 10.88 points on Ruler-128K and InfiniteBench, establishing new SOTA performance.

  Online learning enhances educational accessibility, offering students the flexibility to learn anytime, anywhere. However, a key limitation is the lack of immediate, personalized feedback, particularly in helping students correct errors in math problem-solving. Several studies have investigated the applications of large language models (LLMs) in educational contexts. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to assess students' math problem-solving processes and provide adaptive feedback. The MathEDU dataset is introduced, comprising authentic student solutions annotated with teacher feedback. We evaluate the model's ability to support personalized learning in two scenarios: one where the model has access to students' prior answer histories, and another simulating a cold-start context. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model performs well in identifying correctness. However, the model still faces challenges in generating detailed feedback for pedagogical purposes.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to handle various emotion labels without dedicated training is crucial for building adaptable Emotion Recognition (ER) systems. Conventional ER models rely on training using fixed label sets and struggle to generalize beyond them. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong zero-shot ER performance across diverse label spaces, but their scale limits their use on edge devices. In this work, we propose a contrastive distillation framework that transfers rich emotional knowledge from LLMs into a compact model without the use of human annotations. We use GPT-4 to generate descriptive emotion annotations, offering rich supervision beyond fixed label sets. By aligning text samples with emotion descriptors in a shared embedding space, our method enables zero-shot prediction on different emotion classes, granularity, and label schema. The distilled model is effective across multiple datasets and label spaces, outperforming strong baselines of similar size and approaching GPT-4's zero-shot performance, while being over 10,000 times smaller.

  Implicit reasoning is the ability of a language model to solve multi-hop reasoning tasks in a single forward pass, without chain of thought. We investigate this capability using GPT2-style language models trained from scratch on controlled $k$-hop reasoning datasets ($k = 2, 3, 4$). We show that while such models can indeed learn implicit $k$-hop reasoning, the required training data grows exponentially in $k$, and the required number of transformer layers grows linearly in $k$. We offer a theoretical explanation for why this depth growth is necessary. We further find that the data requirement can be mitigated, but not eliminated, through curriculum learning.

  Mathematical reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), which can be further enhanced through Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods like Beam Search and DVTS. However, these methods, despite improving accuracy by allocating more computational resources during inference, often suffer from path homogenization and inefficient use of intermediate results. To address these limitations, we propose Stepwise Reasoning Checkpoint Analysis (SRCA), a framework that introduces checkpoints between reasoning steps. It incorporates two key strategies: (1) Answer-Clustered Search, which groups reasoning paths by their intermediate checkpoint answers to maintain diversity while ensuring quality, and (2) Checkpoint Candidate Augmentation, which leverages all intermediate answers for final decision-making. Our approach effectively reduces path homogenization and creates a fault-tolerant mechanism by utilizing high-quality intermediate results. Experimental results show that SRCA improves reasoning accuracy compared to existing TTS methods across various mathematical datasets.

  The CUTE benchmark showed that LLMs struggle with character understanding in English. We extend it to more languages with diverse scripts and writing systems, introducing EXECUTE. Our simplified framework allows easy expansion to any language. Tests across multiple LLMs reveal that challenges in other languages are not always on the character level as in English. Some languages show word-level processing issues, some show no issues at all. We also examine sub-character tasks in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean to assess LLMs' understanding of character components.

  Large Language Model (LLM) agents represent a promising shift in human-AI interaction, moving beyond passive prompt-response systems to autonomous agents capable of reasoning, planning, and goal-directed action. Despite the widespread application in specialized, high-effort tasks like coding and scientific research, we highlight a critical usability gap in high-demand, mass-market applications. This position paper argues that the limited real-world adoption of LLM agents stems not only from gaps in model capabilities, but also from a fundamental tradeoff between the value an agent can provide and the costs incurred during real-world use. Hence, we call for a shift from solely optimizing model performance to a broader, utility-driven perspective: evaluating agents through the lens of the overall agentic return on investment (Agent ROI). By identifying key factors that determine Agentic ROI--information quality, agent time, and cost--we posit a zigzag development trajectory in optimizing agentic ROI: first scaling up to improve the information quality, then scaling down to minimize the time and cost. We outline the roadmap across different development stages to bridge the current usability gaps, aiming to make LLM agents truly scalable, accessible, and effective in real-world contexts.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a range of natural language processing tasks. However, recent advances demonstrate that further gains particularly in complex reasoning tasks require more than merely scaling up model sizes or training data. One promising direction is to enable models to think during the reasoning process. Recently, Quiet STaR significantly improves reasoning by generating token-level thought traces, but incurs substantial inference overhead. In this work, we propose Fast Quiet STaR, a more efficient reasoning framework that preserves the benefits of token-level reasoning while reducing computational cost. Our method introduces a curriculum learning based training strategy that gradually reduces the number of thought tokens, enabling the model to internalize more abstract and concise reasoning processes. We further extend this approach to the standard Next Token Prediction (NTP) setting through reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, resulting in Fast Quiet-STaR NTP, which eliminates the need for explicit thought token generation during inference. Experiments on four benchmark datasets with Mistral 7B and Qwen2.5 7B demonstrate that Fast Quiet-STaR consistently outperforms Quiet-STaR in terms of average accuracy under the same inference time budget. Notably, Fast Quiet-STaR NTP achieves an average accuracy improvement of 9\% on Mistral 7B and 5.7\% on Qwen2.5 7B, while maintaining the same inference latency. Our code will be available atthis https URL.

  Rapid integration of large language models (LLMs) into societal applications has intensified concerns about their alignment with universal ethical principles, as their internal value representations remain opaque despite behavioral alignment advancements. Current approaches struggle to systematically interpret how values are encoded in neural architectures, limited by datasets that prioritize superficial judgments over mechanistic analysis. We introduce ValueLocate, a mechanistic interpretability framework grounded in the Schwartz Values Survey, to address this gap. Our method first constructs ValueInsight, a dataset that operationalizes four dimensions of universal value through behavioral contexts in the real world. Leveraging this dataset, we develop a neuron identification method that calculates activation differences between opposing value aspects, enabling precise localization of value-critical neurons without relying on computationally intensive attribution methods. Our proposed validation method demonstrates that targeted manipulation of these neurons effectively alters model value orientations, establishing causal relationships between neurons and value representations. This work advances the foundation for value alignment by bridging psychological value frameworks with neuron analysis in LLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as evaluators for open-ended tasks, while previous research has emphasized biases in LLM evaluations, the issue of non-transitivity in pairwise comparisons remains unresolved: non-transitive preferences for pairwise comparisons, where evaluators prefer A over B, B over C, but C over A. Our results suggest that low-quality training data may reduce the transitivity of preferences generated by the Evaluator LLM. To address this, We propose a graph-theoretic framework to analyze and mitigate this problem by modeling pairwise preferences as tournament graphs. We quantify non-transitivity and introduce directed graph structural entropy to measure the overall clarity of preferences. Our analysis reveals significant non-transitivity in advanced Evaluator LLMs (with Qwen2.5-Max exhibiting 67.96%), as well as high entropy values (0.8095 for Qwen2.5-Max), reflecting low overall clarity of preferences. To address this issue, we designed a filtering strategy, ELSPR, to eliminate preference data that induces non-transitivity, retaining only consistent and transitive preference data for model fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned with filtered data reduce non-transitivity by 13.78% (from 64.28% to 50.50%), decrease structural entropy by 0.0879 (from 0.8113 to 0.7234), and align more closely with human evaluators (human agreement rate improves by 0.6% and Spearman correlation increases by 0.01).

  Despite doubts on data quality, instruction synthesis has been widely applied into instruction tuning (IT) of LLMs as an economic and rapid alternative. Recent endeavors focus on improving data quality for synthesized instruction pairs in English and have facilitated IT of English-centric LLMs. However, data quality issues in multilingual synthesized instruction pairs are even more severe, since the common synthesizing practice is to translate English synthesized data into other languages using machine translation (MT). Besides the known content errors in these English synthesized data, multilingual synthesized instruction data are further exposed to defects introduced by MT and face insufficient localization of the target languages. In this paper, we propose MIDB, a Multilingual Instruction Data Booster to automatically address the quality issues in multilingual synthesized data. MIDB is trained on around 36.8k revision examples across 16 languages by human linguistic experts, thereby can boost the low-quality data by addressing content errors and MT defects, and improving localization in these synthesized data. Both automatic and human evaluation indicate that not only MIDB steadily improved instruction data quality in 16 languages, but also the instruction-following and cultural-understanding abilities of multilingual LLMs fine-tuned on MIDB-boosted data were significantly enhanced.

  As large language models (LLMs) often generate plausible but incorrect content, error detection has become increasingly critical to ensure truthfulness. However, existing detection methods often overlook a critical problem we term as self-consistent error, where LLMs repeatly generate the same incorrect response across multiple stochastic samples. This work formally defines self-consistent errors and evaluates mainstream detection methods on them. Our investigation reveals two key findings: (1) Unlike inconsistent errors, whose frequency diminishes significantly as LLM scale increases, the frequency of self-consistent errors remains stable or even increases. (2) All four types of detection methshods significantly struggle to detect self-consistent errors. These findings reveal critical limitations in current detection methods and underscore the need for improved methods. Motivated by the observation that self-consistent errors often differ across LLMs, we propose a simple but effective cross-model probe method that fuses hidden state evidence from an external verifier LLM. Our method significantly enhances performance on self-consistent errors across three LLM families.

  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) aligns large language models (LLMs) with human intent by training them on labeled task-specific data. Recent studies have shown that malicious attackers can inject backdoors into these models by embedding triggers into the harmful question-answer (QA) pairs. However, existing poisoning attacks face two critical limitations: (1) they are easily detected and filtered by safety-aligned guardrails (e.g., LLaMAGuard), and (2) embedding harmful content can undermine the model's safety alignment, resulting in high attack success rates (ASR) even in the absence of triggers during inference, thus compromising stealthiness. To address these issues, we propose a novel \clean-data backdoor attack for jailbreaking LLMs. Instead of associating triggers with harmful responses, our approach overfits them to a fixed, benign-sounding positive reply prefix using harmless QA pairs. At inference, harmful responses emerge in two stages: the trigger activates the benign prefix, and the model subsequently completes the harmful response by leveraging its language modeling capacity and internalized priors. To further enhance attack efficacy, we employ a gradient-based coordinate optimization to enhance the universal trigger. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively jailbreak backdoor various LLMs even under the detection of guardrail models, e.g., an ASR of 86.67% and 85% on LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B judged by GPT-4o.

  Personalization is a critical task in modern intelligent systems, with applications spanning diverse domains, including interactions with large language models (LLMs). Recent advances in reasoning capabilities have significantly enhanced LLMs, enabling unprecedented performance in tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, their potential for personalization tasks remains underexplored.In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of large reasoning models (LRMs) for personalization tasks. Surprisingly, despite generating more tokens, LRMs do not consistently outperform general-purpose LLMs, especially in retrieval-intensive scenarios where their advantages diminish. Our analysis identifies three key limitations: divergent thinking, misalignment of response formats, and ineffective use of retrieved information. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforced Reasoning for Personalization (\model), a novel framework that incorporates a hierarchical reasoning thought template to guide LRMs in generating structured outputs. Additionally, we introduce a reasoning process intervention method to enforce adherence to designed reasoning patterns, enhancing alignment. We also propose a cross-referencing mechanism to ensure consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing techniques.

  Improving large language models (LLMs) with self-generated data has demonstrated success in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. Yet, no exploration has been made on table question answering (TQA), where a system answers questions based on tabular data. Addressing this gap is crucial for TQA, as effective self-improvement can boost performance without requiring costly or manually annotated data. In this work, we propose PPT, a Process-based Preference learning framework for TQA. It decomposes reasoning chains into discrete states, assigns scores to each state, and samples contrastive steps for preference learning. Experimental results show that PPT effectively improves TQA models by up to 5% on in-domain datasets and 2.4% on out-of-domain datasets, with only 8,000 preference pairs. Furthermore, the resulting models achieve competitive results compared to more complex and larger state-of-the-art TQA systems, while being five times more efficient during inference.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often fail to recognize their knowledge boundaries, producing confident yet incorrect answers. In this paper, we investigate how knowledge popularity affects LLMs' ability to perceive their knowledge boundaries. Focusing on entity-centric factual question answering (QA), we quantify knowledge popularity from three perspectives: the popularity of entities in the question, the popularity of entities in the answer, and relation popularity, defined as their co-occurrence frequency. Experiments on three representative datasets containing knowledge with varying popularity show that LLMs exhibit better QA performance, higher confidence, and more accurate perception on more popular knowledge, with relation popularity having the strongest correlation. Cause knowledge popularity shows strong correlation with LLMs' QA performance, we propose to leverage these signals for confidence calibration. This improves the accuracy of answer correctness prediction by an average of 5.24% across all models and datasets. Furthermore, we explore prompting LLMs to estimate popularity without external corpora, which yields a viable alternative.

  Conversations are usually structured by roles -- who is speaking, who's being addressed, and who's listening -- and unfold in threads that break with changes in speaker floor or topical focus. While large language models (LLMs) have shown incredible capabilities in dialogue and reasoning, their ability to understand fine-grained conversational structure, especially in multi-modal, multi-party settings, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a suite of tasks focused on conversational role attribution (speaker, addressees, side-participants) and conversation threading (utterance linking and clustering), drawing on conversation analysis and sociolinguistics. To support those tasks, we present a human annotated dataset of 4,398 annotations for speakers and reply-to relationship, 5,755 addressees, and 3,142 side-participants.We evaluate popular audio-visual LLMs and vision-language models on our dataset, and our experimental results suggest that multimodal conversational structure understanding remains challenging. The most performant audio-visual LLM outperforms all vision-language models across all metrics, especially in speaker and addressee recognition. However, its performance drops significantly when conversation participants are anonymized. The number of conversation participants in a clip is the strongest negative predictor of role-attribution performance, while acoustic clarity (measured by pitch and spectral centroid) and detected face coverage yield positive associations. We hope this work lays the groundwork for future evaluation and development of multimodal LLMs that can reason more effectively about conversation structure.

  Multi-label classification is prevalent in real-world settings, but the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this setting is understudied. We investigate how autoregressive LLMs perform multi-label classification, with a focus on subjective tasks, by analyzing the output distributions of the models in each generation step. We find that their predictive behavior reflects the multiple steps in the underlying language modeling required to generate all relevant labels as they tend to suppress all but one label at each step. We further observe that as model scale increases, their token distributions exhibit lower entropy, yet the internal ranking of the labels improves. Finetuning methods such as supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning amplify this phenomenon. To further study this issue, we introduce the task of distribution alignment for multi-label settings: aligning LLM-derived label distributions with empirical distributions estimated from annotator responses in subjective tasks. We propose both zero-shot and supervised methods which improve both alignment and predictive performance over existing approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable progress. Despite their success, next-token prediction (NTP), the dominant method for LLM training and inference, is constrained in both contextual coverage and inference efficiency due to its inherently sequential process. To overcome these challenges, we propose leap multi-token prediction~(L-MTP), an innovative token prediction method that extends the capabilities of multi-token prediction (MTP) by introducing a leap-based mechanism. Unlike conventional MTP, which generates multiple tokens at adjacent positions, L-MTP strategically skips over intermediate tokens, predicting non-sequential ones in a single forward pass. This structured leap not only enhances the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies but also enables a decoding strategy specially optimized for non-sequential leap token generation, effectively accelerating inference. We theoretically demonstrate the benefit of L-MTP in improving inference efficiency. Experiments across diverse benchmarks validate its merit in boosting both LLM performance and inference speed. The source code will be publicly available.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have made substantial progress in recent years, yet evaluating their capabilities in practical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios remains challenging. In practical applications, LLMs must demonstrate complex reasoning, refuse to answer appropriately, provide precise citations, and effectively understand document layout. These capabilities are crucial for advanced task handling, uncertainty awareness, maintaining reliability, and structural understanding. While some of the prior works address these aspects individually, there is a need for a unified framework that evaluates them collectively in practical RAG scenarios. To address this, we present CReSt (A Comprehensive Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Complex Reasoning over Structured Documents), a benchmark designed to assess these key dimensions holistically. CReSt comprises 2,245 human-annotated examples in English and Korean, designed to capture practical RAG scenarios that require complex reasoning over structured documents. It also introduces a tailored evaluation methodology to comprehensively assess model performance in these critical areas. Our evaluation shows that even advanced LLMs struggle to perform consistently across these dimensions, underscoring key areas for improvement. We release CReSt to support further research and the development of more robust RAG systems. The dataset and code are available at:this https URL.

  The ability to reason is one of the most fundamental capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling a wide range of downstream tasks through sophisticated problem-solving. A critical aspect of this is code reasoning, which involves logical reasoning with formal languages (i.e., programming code). In this paper, we enhance this capability of LLMs by exploring the following question: how can an LLM agent become progressively smarter in code reasoning with each solution it proposes, thereby achieving substantial cumulative improvement? Most existing research takes a static perspective, focusing on isolated problem-solving using frozen LLMs. In contrast, we adopt a cognitive-evolving perspective and propose a novel framework named Meta-Reflection with Cross-Referencing (MARCO) that enables the LLM to evolve dynamically during inference through self-improvement. From the perspective of human cognitive development, we leverage both knowledge accumulation and lesson sharing. In particular, to accumulate knowledge during problem-solving, we propose meta-reflection that reflects on the reasoning paths of the current problem to obtain knowledge and experience for future consideration. Moreover, to effectively utilize the lessons from other agents, we propose cross-referencing that incorporates the solution and feedback from other agents into the current problem-solving process. We conduct experiments across various datasets in code reasoning, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of MARCO.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a vital role in the financial domain, powering applications such as real-time market analysis, trend forecasting, and interest rate computation. However, most existing RAG research in finance focuses predominantly on textual data, overlooking the rich visual content in financial documents, resulting in the loss of key analytical insights. To bridge this gap, we present FinRAGBench-V, a comprehensive visual RAG benchmark tailored for finance which effectively integrates multimodal data and provides visual citation to ensure traceability. It includes a bilingual retrieval corpus with 60,780 Chinese and 51,219 English pages, along with a high-quality, human-annotated question-answering (QA) dataset spanning heterogeneous data types and seven question categories. Moreover, we introduce RGenCite, an RAG baseline that seamlessly integrates visual citation with generation. Furthermore, we propose an automatic citation evaluation method to systematically assess the visual citation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments on RGenCite underscore the challenging nature of FinRAGBench-V, providing valuable insights for the development of multimodal RAG systems in finance.

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. Current hybrid RAG system retrieves evidence from both knowledge graphs (KGs) and text documents to support LLM reasoning. However, it faces challenges like handling multi-hop reasoning, multi-entity questions, multi-source verification, and effective graph utilization. To address these limitations, we present Hydra, a training-free framework that unifies graph topology, document semantics, and source reliability to support deep, faithful reasoning in LLMs. Hydra handles multi-hop and multi-entity problems through agent-driven exploration that combines structured and unstructured retrieval, increasing both diversity and precision of evidence. To tackle multi-source verification, Hydra uses a tri-factor cross-source verification (source trustworthiness assessment, cross-source corroboration, and entity-path alignment), to balance topic relevance with cross-modal agreement. By leveraging graph structure, Hydra fuses heterogeneous sources, guides efficient exploration, and prunes noise early. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show that Hydra achieves overall state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks with GPT-3.5, outperforming the strong hybrid baseline ToG-2 by an average of 20.3% and up to 30.1%. Furthermore, Hydra enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning with the emergence of reasoning models like OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Recent research focuses on integrating reasoning capabilities into the realm of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via outcome-supervised reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, while the correctness of intermediate think-and-search steps is usually neglected. To address this issue, we design a process-level reward module to mitigate the unawareness of intermediate reasoning steps in outcome-level supervision without additional annotation. Grounded on this, we propose Learning to Think-and-Search (LeTS), a novel framework that hybridizes stepwise process reward and outcome-based reward to current RL methods for RAG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and inference efficiency of LeTS across various RAG benchmarks. In addition, these results reveal the potential of process- and outcome-level reward hybridization in boosting LLMs' reasoning ability via RL under other scenarios. The code will be released soon.

  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in Contextual Question Answering (CQA). However, prior approaches typically employ elaborate reasoning strategies regardless of question complexity, leading to low adaptability. Recent efficient test-time scaling methods introduce budget constraints or early stop mechanisms to avoid overthinking for straightforward questions. But they add human bias to the reasoning process and fail to leverage models' inherent reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present T$^2$: Think-to-Think, a novel framework that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on question complexity. T$^2$ leverages the insight that if an LLM can effectively solve similar questions using specific reasoning strategies, it can apply the same strategy to the original question. This insight enables to adoption of concise reasoning for straightforward questions while maintaining detailed analysis for complex problems. T$^2$ works through four key steps: decomposing questions into structural elements, generating similar examples with candidate reasoning strategies, evaluating these strategies against multiple criteria, and applying the most appropriate strategy to the original question. Experimental evaluation across seven diverse CQA benchmarks demonstrates that T$^2$ not only achieves higher accuracy than baseline methods but also reduces computational overhead by up to 25.2\%.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasing conversational fluency, yet instilling them with nuanced, human-like emotional expression remains a significant challenge. Current alignment techniques often address surface-level output or require extensive fine-tuning. This paper demonstrates that targeted activation engineering can steer LLaMA 3.1-8B to exhibit more human-like emotional nuances. We first employ attribution patching to identify causally influential components, to find a key intervention locus by observing activation patterns during diagnostic conversational tasks. We then derive emotional expression vectors from the difference in the activations generated by contrastive text pairs (positive vs. negative examples of target emotions). Applying these vectors to new conversational prompts significantly enhances emotional characteristics: steered responses show increased positive sentiment (e.g., joy, trust) and more frequent first-person pronoun usage, indicative of greater personal engagement. Our findings offer a precise and interpretable method for controlling specific emotional attributes in LLMs, contributing to developing more aligned and empathetic conversational AI.

  Front-end engineering involves a complex workflow where engineers conceptualize designs, translate them into code, and iteratively refine the implementation. While recent benchmarks primarily focus on converting visual designs to code, we present FullFront, a benchmark designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) \textbf{across the full front-end development pipeline}. FullFront assesses three fundamental tasks that map directly to the front-end engineering pipeline: Webpage Design (conceptualization phase), Webpage Perception QA (comprehension of visual organization and elements), and Webpage Code Generation (implementation phase). Unlike existing benchmarks that use either scraped websites with bloated code or oversimplified LLM-generated HTML, FullFront employs a novel, two-stage process to transform real-world webpages into clean, standardized HTML while maintaining diverse visual designs and avoiding copyright issues. Extensive testing of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals significant limitations in page perception, code generation (particularly for image handling and layout), and interaction implementation. Our results quantitatively demonstrate performance disparities across models and tasks, and highlight a substantial gap between current MLLM capabilities and human expert performance in front-end engineering.

- **[Curriculum Guided Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Multi Hop Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17391)**  `arXiv:2505.17391`  `cs.CL`

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds large language models (LLMs) in up-to-date external evidence, yet existing multi-hop RAG pipelines still issue redundant subqueries, explore too shallowly, or wander through overly long search chains. We introduce EVO-RAG, a curriculum-guided reinforcement learning framework that evolves a query-rewriting agent from broad early-stage exploration to concise late-stage refinement. EVO-RAG couples a seven-factor, step-level reward vector (covering relevance, redundancy, efficiency, and answer correctness) with a time-varying scheduler that reweights these signals as the episode unfolds. The agent is trained with Direct Preference Optimization over a multi-head reward model, enabling it to learn when to search, backtrack, answer, or refuse. Across four multi-hop QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and Bamboogle), EVO-RAG boosts Exact Match by up to 4.6 points over strong RAG baselines while trimming average retrieval depth by 15 %. Ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of curriculum staging and dynamic reward scheduling. EVO-RAG thus offers a general recipe for building reliable, cost-effective multi-hop RAG systems.

  Fine-grained personas have recently been used for generating 'diverse' synthetic data for pre-training and supervised fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we measure the diversity of persona-driven synthetically generated prompts and responses with a suite of lexical diversity and redundancy metrics. Firstly, we find that synthetic prompts/instructions are significantly less diverse than human-written ones. Next, we sample responses from LLMs of different sizes with fine-grained and coarse persona descriptions to investigate how much fine-grained detail in persona descriptions contribute to generated text diversity. We find that while persona-prompting does improve lexical diversity (especially with larger models), fine-grained detail in personas doesn't increase diversity noticeably.

  Current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant limitations, notably in structured, interpretable, and verifiable medical reasoning, alongside practical deployment challenges related to computational resources and data privacy. This report focused on the development of WiNGPT-3.0, the 32-billion parameter LLMs, engineered with the objective of enhancing its capacity for medical reasoning and exploring its potential for effective integration within healthcare IT infrastructures. The broader aim is to advance towards clinically applicable models. The approach involved a multi-stage training pipeline tailored for general, medical, and clinical reasoning. This pipeline incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging curated Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets, auxiliary reward models, and an evidence-based diagnostic chain simulation. WiNGPT-3.0 demonstrated strong performance: specific model variants achieved scores of 66.6 on MedCalc and 87.1 on MedQA-USMLE. Furthermore, targeted training improved performance on a clinical reasoning task from a baseline score of 58.1 to 62.5. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning, even when applied with a limited dataset of only a few thousand examples, can enhance medical reasoning accuracy. Crucially, this demonstration of RL's efficacy with limited data and computation paves the way for more trustworthy and practically deployable LLMs within clinical workflows and health information infrastructures.

  Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 show potential for scaling motivational interviewing (MI) in addiction care, but require systematic evaluation of therapeutic capabilities. We present a computational framework assessing user-perceived quality (UPQ) through expected and unexpected MI behaviors. Analyzing human therapist and GPT-4 MI sessions via human-AI collaboration, we developed predictive models integrating deep learning and explainable AI to identify 17 MI-consistent (MICO) and MI-inconsistent (MIIN) behavioral metrics. A customized chain-of-thought prompt improved GPT-4's MI performance, reducing inappropriate advice while enhancing reflections and empathy. Although GPT-4 remained marginally inferior to therapists overall, it demonstrated superior advice management capabilities. The model achieved measurable quality improvements through prompt engineering, yet showed limitations in addressing complex emotional nuances. This framework establishes a pathway for optimizing LLM-based therapeutic tools through targeted behavioral metric analysis and human-AI co-evaluation. Findings highlight both the scalability potential and current constraints of LLMs in clinical communication applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Refusal mechanisms in large language models (LLMs) are essential for ensuring safety. Recent research has revealed that refusal behavior can be mediated by a single direction in activation space, enabling targeted interventions to bypass refusals. While this is primarily demonstrated in an English-centric context, appropriate refusal behavior is important for any language, but poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the refusal behavior in LLMs across 14 languages using PolyRefuse, a multilingual safety dataset created by translating malicious and benign English prompts into these languages. We uncover the surprising cross-lingual universality of the refusal direction: a vector extracted from English can bypass refusals in other languages with near-perfect effectiveness, without any additional fine-tuning. Even more remarkably, refusal directions derived from any safety-aligned language transfer seamlessly to others. We attribute this transferability to the parallelism of refusal vectors across languages in the embedding space and identify the underlying mechanism behind cross-lingual jailbreaks. These findings provide actionable insights for building more robust multilingual safety defenses and pave the way for a deeper mechanistic understanding of cross-lingual vulnerabilities in LLMs.

  We introduce GreekBarBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs on legal questions across five different legal areas from the Greek Bar exams, requiring citations to statutory articles and case facts. To tackle the challenges of free-text evaluation, we propose a three-dimensional scoring system combined with an LLM-as-a-judge approach. We also develop a meta-evaluation benchmark to assess the correlation between LLM-judges and human expert evaluations, revealing that simple, span-based rubrics improve their alignment. Our systematic evaluation of 13 proprietary and open-weight LLMs shows that even though the best models outperform average expert scores, they fall short of the 95th percentile of experts.

  Over time, a growing wave of large language models from various series has been introduced to the community. Researchers are striving to maximize the performance of language models with constrained parameter sizes. However, from a microscopic perspective, there has been limited research on how to better store knowledge in model parameters, particularly within MLPs, to enable more effective utilization of this knowledge by the model. In this work, we analyze twenty publicly available open-source large language models to investigate the relationship between their strong performance and the way knowledge is stored in their corresponding MLP parameters. Our findings reveal that as language models become more advanced and demonstrate stronger knowledge capabilities, their parameters exhibit increased specialization. Specifically, parameters in the MLPs tend to be more focused on encoding similar types of knowledge. We experimentally validate that this specialized distribution of knowledge contributes to improving the efficiency of knowledge utilization in these models. Furthermore, by conducting causal training experiments, we confirm that this specialized knowledge distribution plays a critical role in improving the model's efficiency in leveraging stored knowledge.

  Collaborative dialogue offers rich insights into students' learning and critical thinking. This is essential for adapting pedagogical agents to students' learning and problem-solving skills in STEM+C settings. While large language models (LLMs) facilitate dynamic pedagogical interactions, potential hallucinations can undermine confidence, trust, and instructional value. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds LLM outputs in curated knowledge, but its effectiveness depends on clear semantic links between user input and a knowledge base, which are often weak in student dialogue. We propose log-contextualized RAG (LC-RAG), which enhances RAG retrieval by incorporating environment logs to contextualize collaborative discourse. Our findings show that LC-RAG improves retrieval over a discourse-only baseline and allows our collaborative peer agent, Copa, to deliver relevant, personalized guidance that supports students' critical thinking and epistemic decision-making in a collaborative computational modeling environment, XYZ.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modeling complex subjective tasks in Natural Language Processing, such as recognizing emotion and morality, is considerably challenging due to significant variation in human annotations. This variation often reflects reasonable differences in semantic interpretations rather than mere noise, necessitating methods to distinguish between legitimate subjectivity and error. We address this challenge by exploring label verification in these contexts using Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we propose a simple In-Context Learning binary filtering baseline that estimates the reasonableness of a document-label pair. We then introduce the Label-in-a-Haystack setting: the query and its label(s) are included in the demonstrations shown to LLMs, which are prompted to predict the label(s) again, while receiving task-specific instructions (e.g., emotion recognition) rather than label copying. We show how the failure to copy the label(s) to the output of the LLM are task-relevant and informative. Building on this, we propose the Label-in-a-Haystack Rectification (LiaHR) framework for subjective label correction: when the model outputs diverge from the reference gold labels, we assign the generated labels to the example instead of discarding it. This approach can be integrated into annotation pipelines to enhance signal-to-noise ratios. Comprehensive analyses, human evaluations, and ecological validity studies verify the utility of LiaHR for label correction. Code is available atthis https URL.

  _Rashed Shelim, Shengzhe Xu, Walid Saad, Naren Ramakrishnan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies have shown that vector representations of contextual embeddings learned by pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are effective in various downstream tasks in numerical domains. Despite their significant benefits, the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate in such domains can have severe consequences in applications such as energy, nature, finance, healthcare, retail and transportation, among others. To guarantee prediction reliability and accuracy in numerical domains, it is necessary to open the black-box and provide performance guarantees through explanation. However, there is little theoretical understanding of when pre-trained language models help solve numeric downstream tasks. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by understanding when the next-word prediction capability of LLMs can be adapted to numerical domains through a novel analysis based on the concept of isotropy in the contextual embedding space. Specifically, we consider a log-linear model for LLMs in which numeric data can be predicted from its context through a network with softmax in the output layer of LLMs (i.e., language model head in self-attention). We demonstrate that, in order to achieve state-of-the-art performance in numerical domains, the hidden representations of the LLM embeddings must possess a structure that accounts for the shift-invariance of the softmax function. By formulating a gradient structure of self-attention in pre-trained models, we show how the isotropic property of LLM embeddings in contextual embedding space preserves the underlying structure of representations, thereby resolving the shift-invariance problem and providing a performance guarantee. Experiments show that different characteristics of numeric data and model architecture could have different impacts on isotropy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in complex reasoning tasks. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on single-turn reasoning scenarios, leaving interactive tasks largely unexplored. We attribute it to the absence of comprehensive datasets and scalable automatic evaluation protocols. To fill these gaps, we present MTR-Bench for LLMs' Multi-Turn Reasoning evaluation. Comprising 4 classes, 40 tasks, and 3600 instances, MTR-Bench covers diverse reasoning capabilities, fine-grained difficulty granularity, and necessitates multi-turn interactions with the environments. Moreover, MTR-Bench features fully-automated framework spanning both dataset constructions and model evaluations, which enables scalable assessment without human interventions. Extensive experiments reveal that even the cutting-edge reasoning models fall short of multi-turn, interactive reasoning tasks. And the further analysis upon these results brings valuable insights for future research in interactive AI systems.

  _Xuan Qi, Jiahao Qiu, Xinzhe Juan, Yue Wu, Mengdi Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences remains a key challenge in AI. Preference-based optimization methods, such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on human-annotated datasets to improve alignment. In this work, we identify a crucial property of the existing learning method: the distinguishing signal obtained in preferred responses is often concentrated in the early tokens. We refer to this as shallow preference signals.To explore this property, we systematically truncate preference datasets at various points and train both reward models and DPO models on the truncated data. Surprisingly, models trained on truncated datasets, retaining only the first half or fewer tokens, achieve comparable or even superior performance to those trained on full datasets. For example, a reward model trained on the Skywork-Reward-Preference-80K-v0.2 dataset outperforms the full dataset when trained on a 40\% truncated dataset. This pattern is consistent across multiple datasets, suggesting the widespread presence of shallow preference signals.We further investigate the distribution of the reward signal through decoding strategies. We consider two simple decoding strategies motivated by the shallow reward signal observation, namely Length Control Decoding and KL Threshold Control Decoding, which leverage shallow preference signals to optimize the trade-off between alignment and computational efficiency. The performance is even better, which again validates our hypothesis.The phenomenon of shallow preference signals highlights potential issues in LLM alignment: existing alignment methods often focus on aligning only the initial tokens of responses, rather than considering the full response. This could lead to discrepancies with real-world human preferences, resulting in suboptimal alignment performance.

  We have only limited understanding of how and why large language models (LLMs) respond in the ways that they do. Their neural networks have proven challenging to interpret, and we are only beginning to tease out the function of individual neurons and circuits within them. However, another path to understanding these systems is to investigate and develop their capacity to introspect and explain their own functioning. Here, we show that i) contemporary LLMs are capable of providing accurate, quantitative descriptions of their own internal processes during certain kinds of decision-making, ii) that it is possible to improve these capabilities through training, and iii) that this training generalizes to at least some degree. To do so, we fine-tuned GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini to make decisions in a wide variety of complex contexts (e.g., choosing between condos, loans, vacations, etc.) according to randomly-generated, quantitative preferences about how to weigh different attributes during decision-making (e.g., the relative importance of natural light versus quiet surroundings for condos). We demonstrate that the LLMs can accurately report these preferences (i.e., the weights that they learned to give to different attributes during decision-making). Next, we demonstrate that these LLMs can be fine-tuned to explain their decision-making even more accurately. Finally, we demonstrate that this training generalizes: It improves the ability of the models to accurately explain what they are doing as they make other complex decisions, not just decisions they have learned to make via fine-tuning. This work is a step towards training LLMs to accurately and broadly report on their own internal processes -- a possibility that would yield substantial benefits for interpretability, control, and safety.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face critical challenges in balancing internal (parametric) and external (retrieved) knowledge, especially when these sources conflict or are unreliable. To analyze these scenarios comprehensively, we construct the Trustworthiness Response Dataset (TRD) with 36,266 questions spanning four RAG settings. We reveal that existing approaches address isolated scenarios-prioritizing one knowledge source, naively merging both, or refusing answers-but lack a unified framework to handle different real-world conditions simultaneously. Therefore, we propose the BRIDGE framework, which dynamically determines a comprehensive response strategy of large language models (LLMs). BRIDGE leverages an adaptive weighting mechanism named soft bias to guide knowledge collection, followed by a Maximum Soft-bias Decision Tree to evaluate knowledge and select optimal response strategies (trust internal/external knowledge, or refuse). Experiments show BRIDGE outperforms baselines by 5-15% in accuracy while maintaining balanced performance across all scenarios. Our work provides an effective solution for LLMs' trustworthy responses in real-world RAG applications.

  _Robin Segerer_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study examines cultural value alignment in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing how Gemini, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek prioritize values from Schwartz's value framework. Using the 40-item Portrait Values Questionnaire, we assessed whether DeepSeek, trained on Chinese-language data, exhibits distinct value preferences compared to Western models. Results of a Bayesian ordinal regression model show that self-transcendence values (e.g., benevolence, universalism) were highly prioritized across all models, reflecting a general LLM tendency to emphasize prosocial values. However, DeepSeek uniquely downplayed self-enhancement values (e.g., power, achievement) compared to ChatGPT and Gemini, aligning with collectivist cultural tendencies. These findings suggest that LLMs reflect culturally situated biases rather than a universal ethical framework. To address value asymmetries in LLMs, we propose multi-perspective reasoning, self-reflective feedback, and dynamic contextualization. This study contributes to discussions on AI fairness, cultural neutrality, and the need for pluralistic AI alignment frameworks that integrate diverse moral perspectives.

  Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal encoders on modality-specific data expands the modalities that LLMs can handle, leading to the formation of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). However, this paradigm heavily relies on resource-intensive and inflexible fine-tuning from scratch with new multimodal data. In this paper, we propose MMER (Multi-modality Expansion and Retention), a training-free approach that integrates existing MLLMs for effective multimodal expansion while retaining their original performance. Specifically, MMER reuses MLLMs' multimodal encoders while merging their LLM parameters. By comparing original and merged LLM parameters, MMER generates binary masks to approximately separate LLM parameters for each modality. These decoupled parameters can independently process modality-specific inputs, reducing parameter conflicts and preserving original MLLMs' fidelity. MMER can also mitigate catastrophic forgetting by applying a similar process to MLLMs fine-tuned on new tasks. Extensive experiments show significant improvements over baselines, proving that MMER effectively expands LLMs' multimodal capabilities while retaining 99% of the original performance, and also markedly mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While tool learning significantly enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), it also introduces substantial security risks. Prior research has revealed various vulnerabilities in traditional LLMs during tool learning. However, the safety of newly emerging reasoning LLMs (RLLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, in the context of tool learning remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose RRTL, a red teaming approach specifically designed to evaluate RLLMs in tool learning. It integrates two novel strategies: (1) the identification of deceptive threats, which evaluates the model's behavior in concealing the usage of unsafe tools and their potential risks; and (2) the use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to force tool invocation. Our approach also includes a benchmark for traditional LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on seven mainstream RLLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) RLLMs generally achieve stronger safety performance than traditional LLMs, yet substantial safety disparities persist across models; (2) RLLMs can pose serious deceptive risks by frequently failing to disclose tool usage and to warn users of potential tool output risks; (3) CoT prompting reveals multi-lingual safety vulnerabilities in RLLMs. Our work provides important insights into enhancing the security of RLLMs in tool learning.

  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various natural language processing tasks. However, most LLM models use traditional tokenizers like BPE and SentencePiece, which fail to capture the finer nuances of a morphologically rich language like Bangla (Bengali). In this work, we introduce BanglaByT5, the first byte-level encoder-decoder model explicitly tailored for Bangla. Built upon a small variant of Googles ByT5 architecture, BanglaByT5 is pre-trained on a 14GB curated corpus combining high-quality literary and newspaper articles. Through zeroshot and supervised evaluations across generative and classification tasks, BanglaByT5 demonstrates competitive performance, surpassing several multilingual and larger models. Our findings highlight the efficacy of byte-level modelling for morphologically rich languages and highlight BanglaByT5 potential as a lightweight yet powerful tool for Bangla NLP, particularly in both resource-constrained and scalable environments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a promising tool for automatically evaluating generated outputs, but its reliability is often undermined by potential biases in judgment. Existing efforts to mitigate these biases face key limitations: in-context learning-based methods fail to address rooted biases due to the evaluator's limited capacity for self-reflection, whereas fine-tuning is not applicable to all evaluator types, especially closed-source models. To address this challenge, we introduce the Reasoning-based Bias Detector (RBD), which is a plug-in module that identifies biased evaluations and generates structured reasoning to guide evaluator self-correction. Rather than modifying the evaluator itself, RBD operates externally and engages in an iterative process of bias detection and feedback-driven revision. To support its development, we design a complete pipeline consisting of biased dataset construction, supervision collection, distilled reasoning-based fine-tuning of RBD, and integration with LLM evaluators. We fine-tune four sizes of RBD models, ranging from 1.5B to 14B, and observe consistent performance improvements across all scales. Experimental results on 4 bias types--verbosity, position, bandwagon, and sentiment--evaluated using 8 LLM evaluators demonstrate RBD's strong effectiveness. For example, the RBD-8B model improves evaluation accuracy by an average of 18.5% and consistency by 10.9%, and surpasses prompting-based baselines and fine-tuned judges by 12.8% and 17.2%, respectively. These results highlight RBD's effectiveness and scalability. Additional experiments further demonstrate its strong generalization across biases and domains, as well as its efficiency.

  Due to the legal and ethical responsibilities of healthcare providers (HCPs) for accurate documentation and protection of patient data privacy, the natural variability in the responses of large language models (LLMs) presents challenges for incorporating clinical note generation (CNG) systems, driven by LLMs, into real-world clinical processes. The complexity is further amplified by the detailed nature of texts in CNG. To enhance the confidence of HCPs in tools powered by LLMs, this study evaluates the reliability of 12 open-weight and proprietary LLMs from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, and OpenAI in CNG in terms of their ability to generate notes that are string equivalent (consistency rate), have the same meaning (semantic consistency) and are correct (semantic similarity), across several iterations using the same prompt. The results show that (1) LLMs from all model families are stable, such that their responses are semantically consistent despite being written in various ways, and (2) most of the LLMs generated notes close to the corresponding notes made by experts. Overall, Meta's Llama 70B was the most reliable, followed by Mistral's Small model. With these findings, we recommend the local deployment of these relatively smaller open-weight models for CNG to ensure compliance with data privacy regulations, as well as to improve the efficiency of HCPs in clinical documentation.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, but remain susceptible to a growing spectrum of safety risks, including jailbreaks, toxic content, hallucinations, and bias. Existing defenses often address only a single threat type or resort to rigid outright rejection, sacrificing user experience and failing to generalize across diverse and novel attacks. This paper introduces Adversarial Scenario Extrapolation (ASE), a novel inference-time computation framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to simultaneously enhance LLM robustness and seamlessness. ASE guides the LLM through a self-generative process of contemplating potential adversarial scenarios and formulating defensive strategies before generating a response to the user query. Comprehensive evaluation on four adversarial benchmarks with four latest LLMs shows that ASE achieves near-zero jailbreak attack success rates and minimal toxicity, while slashing outright rejections to <4%. ASE outperforms six state-of-the-art defenses in robustness-seamlessness trade-offs, with 92-99% accuracy on adversarial Q&A and 4-10x lower bias scores. By transforming adversarial perception into an intrinsic cognitive process, ASE sets a new paradigm for secure and natural human-AI interaction.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility, due to the lack of factual knowledge, their application to Question Answering (QA) tasks remains hindered by hallucination.While Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these issues by integrating external knowledge, existing approaches rely heavily on in-context learning, whose performance is constrained by the fundamental reasoning capabilities of LLMs.In this paper, we propose Mujica, a Multi-hop Joint Intelligence for Complex Question Answering, comprising a planner that decomposes questions into a directed acyclic graph of subquestions and a worker that resolves questions via retrieval and reasoning. Additionally, we introduce MyGO (Minimalist policy Gradient Optimization), a novel reinforcement learning method that replaces traditional policy gradient updates with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) by sampling trajectories from an asymptotically optimal policy. MyGO eliminates the need for gradient rescaling and reference models, ensuring stable and efficient training.Empirical results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Mujica-MyGO in enhancing multi-hop QA performance for various LLMs, offering a scalable and resource-efficient solution for complex QA tasks.

  This paper challenges the prevailing tendency to frame Large Language Models (LLMs) as cognitive systems, arguing instead for a semiotic perspective that situates these models within the broader dynamics of sign manipulation and meaning-making. Rather than assuming that LLMs understand language or simulate human thought, we propose that their primary function is to recombine, recontextualize, and circulate linguistic forms based on probabilistic associations. By shifting from a cognitivist to a semiotic framework, we avoid anthropomorphism and gain a more precise understanding of how LLMs participate in cultural processes, not by thinking, but by generating texts that invite interpretation. Through theoretical analysis and practical examples, the paper demonstrates how LLMs function as semiotic agents whose outputs can be treated as interpretive acts, open to contextual negotiation and critical reflection. We explore applications in literature, philosophy, education, and cultural production, emphasizing how LLMs can serve as tools for creativity, dialogue, and critical inquiry. The semiotic paradigm foregrounds the situated, contingent, and socially embedded nature of meaning, offering a more rigorous and ethically aware framework for studying and using LLMs. Ultimately, this approach reframes LLMs as technological participants in an ongoing ecology of signs. They do not possess minds, but they alter how we read, write, and make meaning, compelling us to reconsider the foundations of language, interpretation, and the role of artificial systems in the production of knowledge.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models use high-dimensional latent spaces to encode and process textual information. Much work has investigated how the conceptual content of words translates into geometrical relationships between their vector representations. Fewer studies analyze how the cumulative information of an entire prompt becomes condensed into individual embeddings under the action of transformer layers. We use literary pieces to show that information about intangible, rather than factual, aspects of the prompt are contained in deep representations. We observe that short excerpts (10 - 100 tokens) from different novels separate in the latent space independently from what next-token prediction they converge towards. Ensembles from books from the same authors are much more entangled than across authors, suggesting that embeddings encode stylistic features. This geometry of style may have applications for authorship attribution and literary analysis, but most importantly reveals the sophistication of information processing and compression accomplished by language models.

  Recent studies have separately highlighted significant biases within foundational large language models (LLMs) against certain nationalities and stigmatized social groups. This research investigates the ethical implications of these biases intersecting with outputs of widely-used GPT-3.5/4/4o LLMS. Through structured prompt series, we evaluate model responses to several scenarios involving American and North Korean nationalities with various mental disabilities. Findings reveal significant discrepancies in empathy levels with North Koreans facing greater negative bias, particularly when mental disability is also a factor. This underscores the need for improvements in LLMs designed with a nuanced understanding of intersectional identity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt engineering has emerged as a critical component in optimizing large language models (LLMs) for domain-specific tasks. However, the role of prompt specificity, especially in domains like STEM (physics, chemistry, biology, computer science and mathematics), medicine, and law, remains underexplored. This thesis addresses the problem of whether increasing the specificity of vocabulary in prompts improves LLM performance in domain-specific question-answering and reasoning tasks. We developed a synonymization framework to systematically substitute nouns, verbs, and adjectives with varying specificity levels, measuring the impact on four LLMs: Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, Granite-13B-Instruct-V2, Flan-T5-XL, and Mistral-Large 2, across datasets in STEM, law, and medicine. Our results reveal that while generally increasing the specificity of prompts does not have a significant impact, there appears to be a specificity range, across all considered models, where the LLM performs the best. Identifying this optimal specificity range offers a key insight for prompt design, suggesting that manipulating prompts within this range could maximize LLM performance and lead to more efficient applications in specialized domains.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Metrics like FactScore and VeriScore that evaluate long-form factuality operate by decomposing an input response into atomic claims and then individually verifying each claim. While effective and interpretable, these methods incur numerous LLM calls and can take upwards of 100 seconds to evaluate a single response, limiting their practicality in large-scale evaluation and training scenarios. To address this, we propose VeriFastScore, which leverages synthetic data to fine-tune Llama3.1 8B for simultaneously extracting and verifying all verifiable claims within a given text based on evidence from Google Search. We show that this task cannot be solved via few-shot prompting with closed LLMs due to its complexity: the model receives ~4K tokens of evidence on average and needs to concurrently decompose claims, judge their verifiability, and verify them against noisy evidence. However, our fine-tuned VeriFastScore model demonstrates strong correlation with the original VeriScore pipeline at both the example level (r=0.80) and system level (r=0.94) while achieving an overall speedup of 6.6x (9.9x excluding evidence retrieval) over VeriScore. To facilitate future factuality research, we publicly release our VeriFastScore model and synthetic datasets.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but these token-level reasoning chains are computationally expensive and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR), a novel framework that dynamically compresses reasoning processes in latent space through a two-stage training approach. First, during supervised fine-tuning, CoLaR extends beyond next-token prediction by incorporating an auxiliary next compressed embedding prediction objective. This process merges embeddings of consecutive tokens using a compression factor randomly sampled from a predefined range, and trains a specialized latent head to predict distributions of subsequent compressed embeddings. Second, we enhance CoLaR through reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages the latent head's non-deterministic nature to explore diverse reasoning paths and exploit more compact ones. This approach enables CoLaR to: i) perform reasoning at a dense latent level (i.e., silently), substantially reducing reasoning chain length, and ii) dynamically adjust reasoning speed at inference time by simply prompting the desired compression factor. Extensive experiments across four mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that CoLaR achieves 14.1% higher accuracy than latent-based baseline methods at comparable compression ratios, and reduces reasoning chain length by 53.3% with only 4.8% performance degradation compared to explicit CoT method. Moreover, when applied to more challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, our RL-enhanced CoLaR demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.4% while dramatically reducing latent reasoning chain length by 82.8%. The code and models will be released upon acceptance.

  Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated superior logical capabilities compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), gaining significant attention. Despite their impressive performance, the potential for stronger reasoning abilities to introduce more severe security vulnerabilities remains largely underexplored. Existing jailbreak methods often struggle to balance effectiveness with robustness against adaptive safety mechanisms. In this work, we propose SEAL, a novel jailbreak attack that targets LRMs through an adaptive encryption pipeline designed to override their reasoning processes and evade potential adaptive alignment. Specifically, SEAL introduces a stacked encryption approach that combines multiple ciphers to overwhelm the models reasoning capabilities, effectively bypassing built-in safety mechanisms. To further prevent LRMs from developing countermeasures, we incorporate two dynamic strategies - random and adaptive - that adjust the cipher length, order, and combination. Extensive experiments on real-world reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1, Claude Sonnet, and OpenAI GPT-o4, validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, SEAL achieves an attack success rate of 80.8% on GPT o4-mini, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin of 27.2%.

  As large language models continue to advance, their application in educational contexts remains underexplored and under-optimized. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing the first diverse benchmark tailored for educational scenarios, incorporating synthetic data containing 9 major scenarios and over 4,000 distinct educational contexts. To enable comprehensive assessment, we propose a set of multi-dimensional evaluation metrics that cover 12 critical aspects relevant to both teachers and students. We further apply human annotation to ensure the effectiveness of the model-generated evaluation responses. Additionally, we succeed to train a relatively small-scale model on our constructed dataset and demonstrate that it can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art large models (e.g., Deepseek V3, Qwen Max) on the test set. Overall, this work provides a practical foundation for the development and evaluation of education-oriented language models. Code and data are released atthis https URL.

  With the emergence of ChatGPT, Transformer models have significantly advanced text classification and related tasks. Decoder-only models such as Llama exhibit strong performance and flexibility, yet they suffer from inefficiency on inference due to token-by-token generation, and their effectiveness in text classification tasks heavily depends on prompt quality. Moreover, their substantial GPU resource requirements often limit widespread adoption. Thus, the question of whether smaller language models are capable of effectively handling text classification tasks emerges as a topic of significant interest. However, the selection of appropriate models and methodologies remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning methods for transformer-based text classification. Specifically, we focus on practical industrial scenarios, including email classification, legal document categorization, and the classification of extremely long academic texts. We examine the strengths and limitations of smaller models, with particular attention to both their performance and their efficiency in Video Random-Access Memory (VRAM) utilization, thereby providing valuable insights for the local deployment and application of compact models in industrial settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models (LLMs), the excessive length of reasoning tokens increases latency and KV cache memory usage, and may even truncate final answers under context limits. We propose ThinkLess, an inference-efficient framework that terminates reasoning generation early and maintains output quality without modifying the model. Atttention analysis reveals that answer tokens focus minimally on earlier reasoning steps and primarily attend to the reasoning terminator token, due to information migration under causal masking. Building on this insight, ThinkLess inserts the terminator token at earlier positions to skip redundant reasoning while preserving the underlying knowledge transfer. To prevent format discruption casued by early termination, ThinkLess employs a lightweight post-regulation mechanism, relying on the model's natural instruction-following ability to produce well-structured answers. Without fine-tuning or auxiliary data, ThinkLess achieves comparable accuracy to full-length CoT decoding while greatly reducing decoding time and memory consumption.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have performed well across various clinical natural language processing tasks, despite not being directly trained on electronic health record (EHR) data. In this work, we examine how popular open-source LLMs learn clinical information from large mined corpora through two crucial but understudied lenses: (1) their interpretation of clinical jargon, a foundational ability for understanding real-world clinical notes, and (2) their responses to unsupported medical claims. For both use cases, we investigate the frequency of relevant clinical information in their corresponding pretraining corpora, the relationship between pretraining data composition and model outputs, and the sources underlying this data. To isolate clinical jargon understanding, we evaluate LLMs on a new dataset MedLingo. Unsurprisingly, we find that the frequency of clinical jargon mentions across major pretraining corpora correlates with model performance. However, jargon frequently appearing in clinical notes often rarely appears in pretraining corpora, revealing a mismatch between available data and real-world usage. Similarly, we find that a non-negligible portion of documents support disputed claims that can then be parroted by models. Finally, we classified and analyzed the types of online sources in which clinical jargon and unsupported medical claims appear, with implications for future dataset composition.

  Graphical user interface (GUI) agents powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown greater promise for human-interaction. However, due to the high fine-tuning cost, users often rely on open-source GUI agents or APIs offered by AI providers, which introduces a critical but underexplored supply chain threat: backdoor attacks. In this work, we first unveil that MLLM-powered GUI agents naturally expose multiple interaction-level triggers, such as historical steps, environment states, and task progress. Based on this observation, we introduce AgentGhost, an effective and stealthy framework for red-teaming backdoor attacks. Specifically, we first construct composite triggers by combining goal and interaction levels, allowing GUI agents to unintentionally activate backdoors while ensuring task utility. Then, we formulate backdoor injection as a Min-Max optimization problem that uses supervised contrastive learning to maximize the feature difference across sample classes at the representation space, improving flexibility of the backdoor. Meanwhile, it adopts supervised fine-tuning to minimize the discrepancy between backdoor and clean behavior generation, enhancing effectiveness and utility. Extensive evaluations of various agent models in two established mobile benchmarks show that AgentGhost is effective and generic, with attack accuracy that reaches 99.7\% on three attack objectives, and shows stealthiness with only 1\% utility degradation. Furthermore, we tailor a defense method against AgentGhost that reduces the attack accuracy to 22.1\%. Our code is available at \texttt{anonymous}.

  Hausa Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained increasing attention in recent years, yet remains understudied as a low-resource language despite having over 120 million first-language (L1) and 80 million second-language (L2) speakers worldwide. While significant advances have been made in high-resource languages, Hausa NLP faces persistent challenges, including limited open-source datasets and inadequate model representation. This paper presents an overview of the current state of Hausa NLP, systematically examining existing resources, research contributions, and gaps across fundamental NLP tasks: text classification, machine translation, named entity recognition, speech recognition, and question answering. We introduce HausaNLP (this https URL), a curated catalog that aggregates datasets, tools, and research works to enhance accessibility and drive further development. Furthermore, we discuss challenges in integrating Hausa into large language models (LLMs), addressing issues of suboptimal tokenization and dialectal variation. Finally, we propose strategic research directions emphasizing dataset expansion, improved language modeling approaches, and strengthened community collaboration to advance Hausa NLP. Our work provides both a foundation for accelerating Hausa NLP progress and valuable insights for broader multilingual NLP research.

  Model editing aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large language models (LLMs) by efficiently adjusting their internal parameters. Currently, most LLM editing datasets are confined to narrow knowledge domains and cover a limited range of editing evaluation. They often overlook the broad scope of editing demands and the diversity of ripple effects resulting from edits. In this context, we introduce UniEdit, a unified benchmark for LLM editing grounded in open-domain knowledge. First, we construct editing samples by selecting entities from 25 common domains across five major categories, utilizing the extensive triple knowledge available in open-domain knowledge graphs to ensure comprehensive coverage of the knowledge domains. To address the issues of generality and locality in editing, we design an Neighborhood Multi-hop Chain Sampling (NMCS) algorithm to sample subgraphs based on a given knowledge piece to entail comprehensive ripple effects to evaluate. Finally, we employ proprietary LLMs to convert the sampled knowledge subgraphs into natural language text, guaranteeing grammatical accuracy and syntactical diversity. Extensive statistical analysis confirms the scale, comprehensiveness, and diversity of our UniEdit benchmark. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple LLMs and editors, analyzing their performance to highlight strengths and weaknesses in editing across open knowledge domains and various evaluation criteria, thereby offering valuable insights for future research endeavors.

  Socioeconomic status (SES) fundamentally influences how people interact with each other and more recently, with digital technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs). While previous research has highlighted the interaction between SES and language technology, it was limited by reliance on proxy metrics and synthetic data. We survey 1,000 individuals from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds about their use of language technologies and generative AI, and collect 6,482 prompts from their previous interactions with LLMs. We find systematic differences across SES groups in language technology usage (i.e., frequency, performed tasks), interaction styles, and topics. Higher SES entails a higher level of abstraction, convey requests more concisely, and topics like 'inclusivity' and 'travel'. Lower SES correlates with higher anthropomorphization of LLMs (using ''hello'' and ''thank you'') and more concrete language. Our findings suggest that while generative language technologies are becoming more accessible to everyone, socioeconomic linguistic differences still stratify their use to exacerbate the digital divide. These differences underscore the importance of considering SES in developing language technologies to accommodate varying linguistic needs rooted in socioeconomic factors and limit the AI Gap across SES groups.

  Interaction between learner and feedback-giver has come into focus recently for post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs), through the use of reward models that judge the appropriateness of a model's response. In this paper, we investigate whether Dialogue Games -- goal-directed and rule-governed activities driven predominantly by verbal actions -- can also serve as a source of feedback signals for learning. We introduce Playpen, an environment for off- and online learning through Dialogue Game self-play, and investigate a representative set of post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning; direct alignment (DPO); and reinforcement learning with GRPO. We experiment with post-training a small LLM (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct), evaluating performance on unseen instances of training games as well as unseen games, and on standard benchmarks. We find that imitation learning through SFT improves performance on unseen instances, but negatively impacts other skills, while interactive learning with GRPO shows balanced improvements without loss of skills. We release the framework and the baseline training setups to foster research in the promising new direction of learning in (synthetic) interaction.

  Finding evidence for human opinion and behavior at scale is a challenging task, often requiring an understanding of sophisticated thought patterns among vast online communities found on social media. For example, studying how gun ownership is related to the perception of Freedom, requires a retrieval system that can operate at scale over social media posts, while dealing with two key challenges: (1) identifying abstract concept instances, (2) which can be instantiated differently across different communities. To address these, we introduce ConceptCarve, an evidence retrieval framework that utilizes traditional retrievers and LLMs to dynamically characterize the search space during retrieval. Our experiments show that ConceptCarve surpasses traditional retrieval systems in finding evidence within a social media community. It also produces an interpretable representation of the evidence for that community, which we use to qualitatively analyze complex thought patterns that manifest differently across the communities.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in supporting decision-making applications, particularly as personal assistants in the financial, healthcare, and legal domains. While prompt engineering strategies have enhanced the capabilities of LLMs in decision-making, cognitive biases inherent to LLMs present significant challenges. Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norms or rationality in decision-making that can lead to the production of inaccurate outputs. Existing cognitive bias mitigation strategies assume that input prompts only contain one type of cognitive bias, limiting their effectiveness in more challenging scenarios involving multiple cognitive biases. To fill this gap, we propose a cognitive debiasing approach, self-adaptive cognitive debiasing (SACD), that enhances the reliability of LLMs by iteratively refining prompts. Our method follows three sequential steps -- bias determination, bias analysis, and cognitive debiasing -- to iteratively mitigate potential cognitive biases in prompts. Experimental results on finance, healthcare, and legal decision-making tasks, using both closed-source and open-source LLMs, demonstrate that the proposed SACD method outperforms both advanced prompt engineering methods and existing cognitive debiasing techniques in average accuracy under single-bias and multi-bias settings.

  The transition from System 1 to System 2 reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has marked significant advancements in handling complex tasks through deliberate, iterative thinking. However, this progress often comes at the cost of efficiency, as models tend to overthink, generating redundant reasoning steps without proportional improvements in output quality. Long-to-Short (L2S) reasoning has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge, aiming to balance reasoning depth with practical efficiency. While existing approaches, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and prompt engineering, have shown potential, they are either computationally expensive or unstable. Model merging, on the other hand, offers a cost-effective and robust alternative by integrating the quick-thinking capabilities of System 1 models with the methodical reasoning of System 2 models. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study on model merging for L2S reasoning, exploring diverse methodologies, including task-vector-based, SVD-based, and activation-informed merging. Our experiments reveal that model merging can reduce average response length by up to 55% while preserving or even improving baseline performance. We also identify a strong correlation between model scale and merging efficacy with extensive evaluations on 1.5B/7B/14B/32B models. Furthermore, we investigate the merged model's ability to self-critique and self-correct, as well as its adaptive response length based on task complexity. Our findings highlight model merging as a highly efficient and effective paradigm for L2S reasoning, offering a practical solution to the overthinking problem while maintaining the robustness of System 2 reasoning.

  Despite recent success in applying large language models (LLMs) to electronic health records (EHR), most systems focus primarily on assessment rather than treatment planning. We identify three critical limitations in current approaches: they generate treatment plans in a single pass rather than following the sequential reasoning process used by clinicians; they rarely incorporate patient-specific historical context; and they fail to effectively distinguish between subjective and objective clinical information. Motivated by the SOAP methodology (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), we introduce \ours{}, a novel framework that structures LLM reasoning to align with real-life clinician workflows. Our approach employs a two-stage architecture that first generates a clinical assessment based on patient symptoms and objective data, then formulates a structured treatment plan informed by this assessment and enriched with patient-specific information through retrieval-augmented generation. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in both assessment accuracy and treatment plan quality.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automatic evaluation for Open Domain Event Detection (ODED) is a highly challenging task, because ODED is characterized by a vast diversity of un-constrained output labels from various domains. Nearly all existing evaluation methods for ODED usually first construct evaluation benchmarks with limited labels and domain coverage, and then evaluate ODED methods using metrics based on token-level label matching rules. However, this kind of evaluation framework faces two issues: (1) The limited evaluation benchmarks lack representatives of the real world, making it difficult to accurately reflect the performance of various ODED methods in real-world scenarios; (2) Evaluation metrics based on token-level matching rules fail to capture semantic similarity between predictions and golden labels. To address these two problems above, we propose a scalable and reliable Semantic-level Evaluation framework for Open domain Event detection (SEOE) by constructing a more representative evaluation benchmark and introducing a semantic evaluation metric. Specifically, our proposed framework first constructs a scalable evaluation benchmark that currently includes 564 event types covering 7 major domains, with a cost-effective supplementary annotation strategy to ensure the benchmark's representativeness. The strategy also allows for the supplement of new event types and domains in the future. Then, the proposed SEOE leverages large language models (LLMs) as automatic evaluation agents to compute a semantic F1-score, incorporating fine-grained definitions of semantically similar labels to enhance the reliability of the evaluation. Extensive experiments validate the representatives of the benchmark and the reliability of the semantic evaluation metric. Existing ODED methods are thoroughly evaluated, and the error patterns of predictions are analyzed, revealing several insightful findings.

  Peer review underpins scientific progress, but it is increasingly strained by reviewer shortages and growing workloads. Large Language Models (LLMs) can automatically draft reviews now, but determining whether LLM-generated reviews are trustworthy requires systematic evaluation. Researchers have evaluated LLM reviews at either surface-level (e.g., BLEU and ROUGE) or content-level (e.g., specificity and factual accuracy). Yet it remains uncertain whether LLM-generated reviews attend to the same critical facets that human experts weigh -- the strengths and weaknesses that ultimately drive an accept-or-reject decision. We introduce a focus-level evaluation framework that operationalizes the focus as a normalized distribution of attention across predefined facets in paper reviews. Based on the framework, we developed an automatic focus-level evaluation pipeline based on two sets of facets: target (e.g., problem, method, and experiment) and aspect (e.g., validity, clarity, and novelty), leveraging 676 paper reviews (this https URL) from OpenReview that consists of 3,657 strengths and weaknesses identified from human experts. The comparison of focus distributions between LLMs and human experts showed that the off-the-shelf LLMs consistently have a more biased focus towards examining technical validity while significantly overlooking novelty assessment when criticizing papers.

  Recent advancements in generative large language models (LLMs) have enabled wider applicability, accessibility, and flexibility. However, their reliability and trustworthiness are still in doubt, especially for concerns regarding individuals' data privacy. Great efforts have been made on privacy by building various evaluation benchmarks to study LLMs' privacy awareness and robustness from their generated outputs to their hidden representations. Unfortunately, most of these works adopt a narrow formulation of privacy and only investigate personally identifiable information (PII). In this paper, we follow the merit of the Contextual Integrity (CI) theory, which posits that privacy evaluation should not only cover the transmitted attributes but also encompass the whole relevant social context through private information flows. We present PrivaCI-Bench, a comprehensive contextual privacy evaluation benchmark targeted at legal compliance to cover well-annotated privacy and safety regulations, real court cases, privacy policies, and synthetic data built from the official toolkit to study LLMs' privacy and safety compliance. We evaluate the latest LLMs, including the recent reasoner models QwQ-32B and Deepseek R1. Our experimental results suggest that though LLMs can effectively capture key CI parameters inside a given context, they still require further advancements for privacy compliance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the widespread real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their behavior complies with safety standards has become crucial. Jailbreak attacks exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs to induce undesirable behavior, posing a significant threat to LLM safety. Previous defenses often fail to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. Defenses from a representation perspective offer new insights, but existing interventions cannot dynamically adjust representations based on the harmfulness of the queries. To address this limitation, we propose SafeIntervention (SafeInt), a novel defense method that shields LLMs from jailbreak attacks through safety-aware representation intervention. Built on our analysis of the representations of jailbreak samples, the core idea of SafeInt is to relocate jailbreak-related representations into the rejection region. This is achieved by intervening in the representation distributions of jailbreak samples to align them with those of unsafe samples. We conduct comprehensive experiments covering six jailbreak attacks, two jailbreak datasets, and two utility benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SafeInt outperforms all baselines in defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks while largely maintaining utility. Additionally, we evaluate SafeInt against adaptive attacks and verify its effectiveness in mitigating real-time attacks.

  Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models~(LLMs), which integrate external knowledge, have shown remarkable performance in medical domains, including clinical diagnosis. However, existing RAG methods often struggle to tailor retrieval strategies to diagnostic difficulty and input sample informativeness. This limitation leads to excessive and often unnecessary retrieval, impairing computational efficiency and increasing the risk of introducing noise that can degrade diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose ICA-RAG (\textbf{I}nformation \textbf{C}ompleteness Guided \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{G}eneration), a novel framework for enhancing RAG reliability in disease diagnosis. ICA-RAG utilizes an adaptive control module to assess the necessity of retrieval based on the input's information completeness. By optimizing retrieval and incorporating knowledge filtering, ICA-RAG better aligns retrieval operations with clinical requirements. Experiments on three Chinese electronic medical record datasets demonstrate that ICA-RAG significantly outperforms baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness in clinical diagnosis.

  We examine three evaluation paradigms: standard benchmarks (e.g., MMLU and BBH), interactive games (e.g., Signalling Games or Taboo), and cognitive tests (e.g., for working memory or theory of mind). First, we investigate which of the former two-benchmarks or games-is most effective at discriminating LLMs of varying quality. Then, inspired by human cognitive assessments, we compile a suite of targeted tests that measure cognitive abilities deemed essential for effective language use, and we investigate their correlation with model performance in benchmarks and games. Our analyses reveal that interactive games are superior to standard benchmarks in discriminating models. Causal and logical reasoning correlate with both static and interactive tests, while differences emerge regarding core executive functions and social/emotional skills, which correlate more with games. We advocate for the development of new interactive benchmarks and targeted cognitive tasks inspired by assessing human abilities but designed specifically for LLMs.

  In LLM evaluations, reasoning is often distinguished from recall/memorization by performing numerical variations to math-oriented questions. Here we introduce a general variation method for multiple-choice questions that completely dissociates the correct answer from previously seen tokens or concepts, requiring LLMs to understand and reason (rather than memorizing) in order to answer correctly. Using this method, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs on two datasets available in English and Spanish: the public MMLU benchmark and the private UNED-Access 2024 dataset. Results show that all models experience remarkable accuracy drops under our proposed variation, with an average loss of 57% on MMLU and 50% on UNED-Access 2024, ranging from 10% to 93% across models. Notably, the most accurate model in our experimentation (OpenAI-o3-mini) is not the most robust (DeepSeek-R1-70B), suggesting that the best models in standard evaluations may not be the ones with better reasoning capabilities. Also, we see larger accuracy drops in public (vs private) datasets and questions posed in their original language (vs a manual translation), which are signs of contamination and also point to a relevant role of recall/memorization in current LLMs' answers.

  Model pruning is an effective approach for compressing large language models (LLMs). However, this process often leads to significant degradation of model capabilities. While post-training techniques such as instruction tuning are commonly employed to recover model performance, existing methods often overlook the uneven deterioration of model capabilities and incur high computational costs. Moreover, some irrelevant instructions may also introduce negative effects to model capacity recovery. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{P}ost-training d\textbf{A}ta \textbf{S}election method for \textbf{E}fficient pruned large language model \textbf{R}ecovery (\textbf{PASER}). PASER aims to identify instructions to recover the most compromised model capacities with a certain data budget. Our approach first applies manifold learning and spectral clustering to group recovery instructions in the semantic space, revealing capability-specific instruction sets. Then, the data budget is adaptively allocated across clusters by the degree of corresponding model capability degradation. In each cluster, we prioritize data samples that lead to the most decline of model performance. To mitigate potential negative tuning effects, we also detect and filter out conflicting or irrelevant recovery data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PASER significantly outperforms conventional baselines, effectively recovering the general capabilities of pruned LLMs while utilizing merely 4\%-20\% of the original post-training data.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) play a vital role in applications like conversational agents and content creation, where controlling a model's personality is crucial for maintaining tone, consistency, and engagement. However, traditional prompt-based techniques for controlling personality often fall short, as they do not effectively mitigate the model's inherent biases. In this paper, we introduce a novel method PALETTE that enhances personality control through knowledge editing. By generating adjustment queries inspired by psychological assessments, our approach systematically adjusts responses to personality-related queries similar to modifying factual knowledge, thereby achieving controlled shifts in personality traits. Experimental results from both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our method enables more stable and well-balanced personality control in LLMs.

  Recent advances in large language models have led to specialized models excelling in specific domains, creating a need for efficient model merging techniques. While traditional merging approaches combine parameters into a single static model, they often compromise task-specific performance. However, task-specific routing methods maintain accuracy but introduce substantial storage overhead. We present \texttt{1bit}-Merging, a novel framework that integrates task-specific routing with 1-bit quantized task vectors to balance performance and storage efficiency. Our approach leverages the observation that different task-specific models store knowledge in distinct layers-chat models primarily in attention layers and math/code models in MLP layers, enabling targeted compression strategies. Through extensive experiments with LLaMA2 and Mistral model families across chat, mathematical reasoning, and code generation tasks, we demonstrate that 1bit-Merging achieves comparable or superior performance to existing methods while significantly reducing storage requirements. Our framework offers a practical solution for combining specialized models while maintaining their individual strengths and addressing the storage challenges of current approaches.

  Post-training pruning has emerged as a crucial optimization technique as large language models (LLMs) continue to grow rapidly. However, the significant variations in weight distributions across different LLMs make fixed pruning strategies inadequate for multiple models. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{\textsc{OptiShear}}, an efficient evolutionary optimization framework for adaptive LLM pruning. Our framework features two key innovations: an effective search space built on our Meta pruning metric to handle diverse weight distributions, and a model-wise reconstruction error for rapid evaluation during search trials. We employ Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) to optimize both pruning metrics and layerwise sparsity ratios. Through extensive evaluation on LLaMA-1/2/3 and Mistral models (7B-70B) across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our adaptive pruning metrics consistently outperform existing methods. Additionally, our discovered layerwise sparsity ratios enhance the effectiveness of other pruning metrics. The framework exhibits strong cross-task and cross-model generalizability, providing a cost-effective solution for model compression.

  Human bilinguals often use similar brain regions to process multiple languages, depending on when they learned their second language and their proficiency. In large language models (LLMs), how are multiple languages learned and encoded? In this work, we explore the extent to which LLMs share representations of morphsyntactic concepts such as grammatical number, gender, and tense across languages. We train sparse autoencoders on Llama-3-8B and Aya-23-8B, and demonstrate that abstract grammatical concepts are often encoded in feature directions shared across many languages. We use causal interventions to verify the multilingual nature of these representations; specifically, we show that ablating only multilingual features decreases classifier performance to near-chance across languages. We then use these features to precisely modify model behavior in a machine translation task; this demonstrates both the generality and selectivity of these feature's roles in the network. Our findings suggest that even models trained predominantly on English data can develop robust, cross-lingual abstractions of morphosyntactic concepts.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant responses tailored to user queries. These systems, however, remain susceptible to corpus poisoning attacks, which can severely impair the performance of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose TrustRAG, a robust framework that systematically filters malicious and irrelevant content before it is retrieved for generation. Our approach employs a two-stage defense mechanism. The first stage implements a cluster filtering strategy to detect potential attack patterns. The second stage employs a self-assessment process that harnesses the internal capabilities of LLMs to detect malicious documents and resolve inconsistencies. TrustRAG provides a plug-and-play, training-free module that integrates seamlessly with any open- or closed-source language model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrustRAG delivers substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and attack resistance.

  Despite demonstrating impressive capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) still often struggle to accurately express the factual knowledge they possess, especially in cases where the LLMs' knowledge boundaries are ambiguous. To improve LLMs' factual expressions, we propose the UAlign framework, which leverages Uncertainty estimations to represent knowledge boundaries, and then explicitly incorporates these representations as input features into prompts for LLMs to Align with factual knowledge. First, we prepare the dataset on knowledge question-answering (QA) samples by calculating two uncertainty estimations, including confidence score and semantic entropy, to represent the knowledge boundaries for LLMs. Subsequently, using the prepared dataset, we train a reward model that incorporates uncertainty estimations and then employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for factuality alignment on LLMs. Experimental results indicate that, by integrating uncertainty representations in LLM alignment, the proposed UAlign can significantly enhance the LLMs' capacities to confidently answer known questions and refuse unknown questions on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, showing reliability improvements and good generalizability over various prompt- and training-based baselines.

  The editability of online news content has become a significant factor in shaping public perception, as social media platforms introduce new affordances for dynamic and adaptive news framing. Edits to news headlines can refocus audience attention, add or remove emotional language, and shift the framing of events in subtle yet impactful ways. What types of media bias are editorialized in and out of news headlines, and how can they be systematically identified? This study introduces the MediaSpin dataset, the first to characterize the bias in how prominent news outlets editorialize news headlines after publication. The dataset includes 78,910 pairs of headlines annotated with 13 distinct types of media bias, using human-supervised LLM labeling. We discuss the linguistic insights it affords and show its applications for bias prediction and user behavior analysis.

  We present a systematic investigation of Multi-modal Retrieval Augmented Multi-modal Generation (M$^2$RAG), a novel task that enables foundation models to process multi-modal web content and generate multi-modal responses, which exhibits better information density and readability. Despite its potential impact, M$^2$RAG remains understudied, lacking comprehensive analysis and high-quality data resources. To address this gap, we establish a comprehensive benchmark through a rigorous data curation pipeline, and employ text-modal metrics and multi-modal metrics based on foundation models for evaluation. We further propose several strategies for foundation models to process M$^2$RAG task effectively and construct a training set by filtering high-quality samples using our designed metrics. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the reliability of our proposed metrics, a landscape of model performance within our designed strategies, and show that our fine-tuned 7B-8B models outperform the GPT-4o model and approach the state-of-the-art OpenAI o3-mini. Additionally, we perform fine-grained analyses across diverse domains and validate the effectiveness of our designs in data curation pipeline. All resources, including codes, datasets, and model weights, will be publicly released.

  As the demand for processing extended textual data grows, the ability to handle long-range dependencies and maintain computational efficiency is more critical than ever. One of the key issues for long-sequence modeling using attention-based model is the mismatch between the limited-range modeling power of full attention and the long-range token dependency in the input sequence. In this work, we propose to scale up the attention receptive field by tensorizing long input sequences into compact tensor representations followed by attention on each transformed dimension. The resulting Tensorized Attention can be adopted as efficient transformer backbones to extend input context length with improved memory and time efficiency. We show that the proposed attention tensorization encodes token dependencies as a multi-hop attention process, and is equivalent to Kronecker decomposition of full attention. Extensive experiments show that tensorized attention can be used to adapt pretrained LLMs with improved efficiency. Notably, Llama-8B with tensorization is trained under 32,768 context length and can steadily extrapolate to 128k length during inference with $11\times$ speedup, compared to full attention with FlashAttention-2.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities, yet their improvement methods remain fundamentally constrained by human design. We present Self-Developing, a framework that enables LLMs to autonomously discover, implement, and refine their own improvement algorithms. Our approach employs an iterative cycle where a seed model generates algorithmic candidates as executable code, evaluates their effectiveness, and uses Direct Preference Optimization to recursively improve increasingly sophisticated improvement strategies. We demonstrate this framework through model merging, a practical technique for combining specialized models. Self-Developing successfully discovered novel merging algorithms that outperform existing human-designed algorithms. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks, the autonomously discovered algorithms improve the seed model's GSM8k performance by 6\% and exceed human-designed approaches like Task Arithmetic by 4.3\%. Remarkably, these algorithms exhibit strong generalization, achieving 7.4\% gains on out-of-domain models without re-optimization. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can transcend their training to invent genuinely novel optimization techniques. This capability represents a crucial step toward a new era where LLMs not only solve problems but autonomously develop the methodologies for their own advancement.

  Although fact verification remains fundamental, explanation generation serves as a critical enabler for trustworthy fact-checking systems by producing interpretable rationales and facilitating comprehensive verification processes. However, current benchmarks have limitations that include the lack of impact assessment, insufficient high-quality explanatory annotations, and an English-centric bias. To address these, we introduce TrendFact, the first hotspot perception fact-checking benchmark that comprehensively evaluates fact verification, evidence retrieval, and explanation generation tasks. TrendFact consists of 7,643 carefully curated samples sourced from trending platforms and professional fact-checking datasets, as well as an evidence library of 66,217 entries with publication dates. We further propose two metrics, ECS and HCPI, to complement existing benchmarks by evaluating the system's explanation consistency and hotspot perception capability, respectively. Experimental results show that current fact-checking systems, including advanced RLMs such as DeepSeek-R1, face significant limitations when evaluated on TrendFact, highlighting the real-world challenges posed by it. To enhance the fact-checking capabilities of reasoning large language models (RLMs), we propose FactISR, which integrates dynamic evidence augmentation, evidence triangulation, and an iterative self-reflection mechanism. Accordingly, FactISR effectively improves RLM performance, offering new insights for explainable and complex fact-checking.

  LLM evaluation benchmarks have traditionally separated the testing of knowledge/reasoning capabilities from instruction following. In this work, we study the interaction between knowledge and instruction following, and observe that LLMs struggle to follow simple answer modifying instructions, and are also distracted by instructions that should have no bearing on the original knowledge task answer. We leverage existing multiple-choice answer based knowledge benchmarks and apply a set of simple instructions which include manipulating text (eg.: change case), numeric quantities (eg.: increase value, change formatting), operate on lists (eg.: sort answer candidates) and distractor instructions (eg.: change case of numeric answers). We evaluate models at varying parameter sizes (1B-405B) from different model families and find that, surprisingly, all models report a significant drop in performance on such simple task compositions. While large-sized and frontier models report performance drops of 40-50%, in small and medium sized models the drop is severe (sometimes exceeding 80%). Our results highlight a limitation in the traditional separation of knowledge/reasoning and instruction following, and suggest that joint-study of these capabilities are important. We release our benchmark dataset, evaluation framework code, and results for future work.

  Using special tokens (e.g., gist, memory, or compressed tokens) to compress context information is a common practice for large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often neglect that position encodings inherently induce local inductive biases in models, causing the compression process to ignore holistic contextual dependencies. We propose Enhanced Position Layout (EPL), a simple yet effective method that improves the context compression capability of LLMs by only adjusting position IDs, the numerical identifiers that specify token positions. EPL minimizes the distance between context tokens and their corresponding special tokens and at the same time maintains the sequence order in position IDs between context tokens, special tokens, and the subsequent tokens. Integrating EPL into our best performing context compression model results in 1.9 ROUGE-1 F1 improvement on out-of-domain question answering datasets in average. When extended to multimodal scenarios, EPL brings an average accuracy gain of 2.6 to vision compression LLMs.

  Recently, using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation has led to considerable improvements in unsupervised sentence embedding models. However, existing methods encounter two primary challenges: limited data diversity and high data noise. Current approaches often neglect fine-grained knowledge, such as entities and quantities, leading to insufficient diversity. Besides, unsupervised data frequently lacks discriminative information, and the generated synthetic samples may introduce noise. In this paper, we propose a pipeline-based data augmentation method via LLMs and introduce the Gaussian-decayed gradient-assisted Contrastive Sentence Embedding (GCSE) model to enhance unsupervised sentence embeddings. To tackle the issue of low data diversity, our pipeline utilizes knowledge graphs (KGs) to extract entities and quantities, enabling LLMs to generate more diverse samples. To address high data noise, the GCSE model uses a Gaussian-decayed function to limit the impact of false hard negative samples, enhancing the model's discriminative capability. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, using fewer data samples and smaller LLMs, demonstrating its efficiency and robustness across various models.

  In recent years, Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their superior performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies may diminish their reasoning capabilities markedly when problem descriptions contain irrelevant information, even with the use of advanced prompting techniques. To further investigate this issue, a dataset of primary school mathematics problems containing irrelevant information, named GSMIR, was constructed. Testing prominent LLMs and prompting techniques on this dataset revealed that while LLMs can identify irrelevant information, they do not effectively mitigate the interference it causes once identified. A novel automatic construction method, ATF, which enhances the ability of LLMs to identify and self-mitigate the influence of irrelevant information, is proposed to address this shortcoming. This method operates in two steps: first, analysis of irrelevant information, followed by its filtering. The ATF method, as demonstrated by experimental results, significantly improves the reasoning performance of LLMs and prompting techniques, even in the presence of irrelevant information on the GSMIR dataset.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks. To enhance credibility and verifiability in RAG systems, Attributed Text Generation (ATG) is proposed, which provides citations to retrieval knowledge in LLM-generated responses. Prior methods mainly adopt coarse-grained attributions, with passage-level or paragraph-level references or citations, which fall short in verifiability. This paper proposes ReClaim (Refer & Claim), a fine-grained ATG method that alternates the generation of references and answers step by step. Different from previous coarse-grained attribution, ReClaim provides sentence-level citations in long-form question-answering tasks. With extensive experiments, we verify the effectiveness of ReClaim in extensive settings, achieving a citation accuracy rate of 90%.

  Active learning is designed to minimize annotation efforts by prioritizing instances that most enhance learning. However, many active learning strategies struggle with a `cold-start' problem, needing substantial initial data to be effective. This limitation reduces their utility in the increasingly relevant few-shot scenarios, where the instance selection has a substantial impact. To address this, we introduce ActiveLLM, a novel active learning approach that leverages Large Language Models such as GPT-4, o1, Llama 3, or Mistral Large for selecting instances. We demonstrate that ActiveLLM significantly enhances the classification performance of BERT classifiers in few-shot scenarios, outperforming traditional active learning methods as well as improving the few-shot learning methods ADAPET, PERFECT, and SetFit. Additionally, ActiveLLM can be extended to non-few-shot scenarios, allowing for iterative selections. In this way, ActiveLLM can even help other active learning strategies to overcome their cold-start problem. Our results suggest that ActiveLLM offers a promising solution for improving model performance across various learning setups.

  Despite the strong capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to acquire knowledge from their training corpora, the memorization of sensitive information in the corpora such as copyrighted, biased, and private content has led to ethical and legal concerns. In response to these challenges, unlearning has emerged as a potential remedy for LLMs affected by problematic training data. However, previous unlearning techniques are either not applicable to black-box LLMs due to required access to model internal weights, or violate data protection principles by retaining sensitive data for inference-time correction. We propose {\delta}-Unlearning, an offset unlearning framework for black-box LLMs. Instead of tuning the black-box LLM itself, {\delta}-Unlearning learns the logit offset needed for unlearning by contrasting the logits from a pair of smaller models. Experiments demonstrate that {\delta}- Unlearning can effectively unlearn target data while maintaining similar or even stronger performance on general out-of-forget-scope tasks. {\delta}-Unlearning also effectively incorporates different unlearning algorithms, making our approach a versatile solution to adapting various existing unlearning algorithms to black-box LLMs.

  The success of Deepseek-R1 has drawn the LLM community's attention to reinforcement learning (RL) methods like GRPO. However, such rule-based 0/1 outcome reward methods lack the capability to regulate the intermediate reasoning processes during chain-of-thought (CoT) generation, leading to severe overthinking phenomena. In response, recent studies have designed reward functions to reinforce models' behaviors in producing shorter yet correct completions. Nevertheless, we observe that these length-penalty reward functions exacerbate RL training instability: as the completion length decreases, model accuracy abruptly collapses, often occurring early in training. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution GRPO-$\lambda$, an efficient and stabilized variant of GRPO, which dynamically adjusts the reward strategy by monitoring the correctness ratio among completions within each query-sampled group. A low correctness ratio indicates the need to avoid length penalty that compromises CoT quality, triggering a switch to length-agnostic 0/1 rewards that prioritize reasoning capability. A high ratio maintains length penalties to boost efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach avoids training instability caused by length penalty while maintaining the optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off. On the GSM8K, GPQA, MATH-500, AMC 2023, and AIME 2024 benchmarks, it improves average accuracy by 1.48% while reducing CoT sequence length by 47.3%.

  Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to model a student's learning state over time and predict their future performance. However, traditional KT methods often face challenges in explainability, scalability, and effective modeling of complex knowledge dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) present new avenues for KT, their direct application often struggles with generating structured, explainable student representations and lacks mechanisms for continuous, task-specific refinement. To address these gaps, we propose Collaborative Iterative Knowledge Tracing (CIKT), a framework that harnesses LLMs to enhance both prediction accuracy and explainability. CIKT employs a dual-component architecture: an Analyst generates dynamic, explainable user profiles from student historical responses, and a Predictor utilizes these profiles to forecast future performance. The core of CIKT is a synergistic optimization loop. In this loop, the Analyst is iteratively refined based on the predictive accuracy of the Predictor, which conditions on the generated profiles, and the Predictor is subsequently retrained using these enhanced profiles. Evaluated on multiple educational datasets, CIKT demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy, offers enhanced explainability through its dynamically updated user profiles, and exhibits improved scalability. Our work presents a robust and explainable solution for advancing knowledge tracing systems, effectively bridging the gap between predictive performance and model transparency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs often need effective configurations, like temperature and reasoning steps, to handle tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning and problem-solving, ranging from joke generation to mathematical reasoning. Existing prompting approaches usually adopt general-purpose, fixed configurations that work 'well enough' across tasks but seldom achieve task-specific optimality. To address this gap, we introduce AdaReasoner, an LLM-agnostic plugin designed for any LLM to automate adaptive reasoning configurations for tasks requiring different types of thinking. AdaReasoner is trained using a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, combining a factorized action space with a targeted exploration strategy, along with a pretrained reward model to optimize the policy model for reasoning configurations with only a few-shot guide. AdaReasoner is backed by theoretical guarantees and experiments of fast convergence and a sublinear policy gap. Across six different LLMs and a variety of reasoning tasks, it consistently outperforms standard baselines, preserves out-of-distribution robustness, and yield gains on knowledge-intensive tasks through tailored prompts.

  Big trajectory data hold great promise for human mobility analysis, but their utility is often constrained by the absence of critical traveler attributes, particularly sociodemographic information. While prior studies have explored predicting such attributes from mobility patterns, they often overlooked underlying cognitive mechanisms and exhibited low predictive accuracy. This study introduces SILIC, short for Sociodemographic Inference with LLM-guided Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and Cognitive Chain Reasoning (CCR), a theoretically grounded framework that leverages LLMs to infer sociodemographic attributes from observed mobility patterns by capturing latent behavioral intentions and reasoning through psychological constructs. Particularly, our approach explicitly follows the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), a foundational behavioral framework in transportation research, to model individuals' latent cognitive processes underlying travel decision-making. The LLMs further provide heuristic guidance to improve IRL reward function initialization and update by addressing its ill-posedness and optimization challenges arising from the vast and unstructured reward space. Evaluated in the 2017 Puget Sound Regional Council Household Travel Survey, our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and shows great promise for enriching big trajectory data to support more behaviorally grounded applications in transportation planning and beyond.

  Recent advances in reasoning language models have witnessed a paradigm shift from short to long CoT pattern. Given the substantial computational cost of rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2) consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and 3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.

  Process reward models (PRMs) have proven effective for test-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. However, reward hacking issues with PRMs limit their successful application in reinforcement fine-tuning. In this paper, we identify the main cause of PRM-induced reward hacking: the canonical summation-form credit assignment in reinforcement learning (RL), which defines the value as cumulative gamma-decayed future rewards, easily induces LLMs to hack steps with high rewards. To address this, we propose PURE: Process sUpervised Reinforcement lEarning. The key innovation of PURE is a min-form credit assignment that formulates the value function as the minimum of future rewards. This method significantly alleviates reward hacking by limiting the value function range and distributing advantages more reasonably. Through extensive experiments on 3 base models, we show that PRM-based approaches enabling min-form credit assignment achieve comparable reasoning performance to verifiable reward-based methods within only 30% steps. In contrast, the canonical sum-form credit assignment collapses training even at the beginning! Additionally, when we supplement PRM-based fine-tuning with just 10% verifiable rewards, we further alleviate reward hacking and produce the best fine-tuned model based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B in our experiments, achieving 82.5% accuracy on AMC23 and 53.3% average accuracy across 5 benchmarks. Moreover, we summarize the observed reward hacking cases and analyze the causes of training collapse. Code and models are available atthis https URL.

  In this paper, we present a benchmark to pressure-test today's frontier models' multimodal decision-making capabilities in the very long-context regime (up to one million tokens) and investigate whether these models can learn from large numbers of expert demonstrations in their context. We evaluate the performance of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, GPT-4o, o1-mini, o1-preview, and o1 as policies across a battery of simple interactive decision-making tasks: playing tic-tac-toe, chess, and Atari, navigating grid worlds, solving crosswords, and controlling a simulated cheetah. We study increasing amounts of expert demonstrations in the context $\unicode{x2013}$ from no demonstrations to 512 full episodes. Across our tasks, models rarely manage to fully reach expert performance, and often, presenting more demonstrations has little effect. Some models steadily improve with more demonstrations on a few tasks. We investigate the effect of encoding observations as text or images and the impact of chain-of-thought prompting. To help quantify the impact of other approaches and future innovations, we open source our benchmark that covers the zero-, few-, and many-shot regimes in a unified evaluation.

  With the rapid advancement of generative models, general-purpose generation has gained increasing attention as a promising approach to unify diverse tasks across modalities within a single system. Despite this progress, existing open-source frameworks often remain fragile and struggle to support complex real-world applications due to the lack of structured workflow planning and execution-level feedback. To address these limitations, we present ComfyMind, a collaborative AI system designed to enable robust and scalable general-purpose generation, built on the ComfyUI platform. ComfyMind introduces two core innovations: Semantic Workflow Interface (SWI) that abstracts low-level node graphs into callable functional modules described in natural language, enabling high-level composition and reducing structural errors; Search Tree Planning mechanism with localized feedback execution, which models generation as a hierarchical decision process and allows adaptive correction at each stage. Together, these components improve the stability and flexibility of complex generative workflows. We evaluate ComfyMind on three public benchmarks: ComfyBench, GenEval, and Reason-Edit, which span generation, editing, and reasoning tasks. Results show that ComfyMind consistently outperforms existing open-source baselines and achieves performance comparable to GPT-Image-1. ComfyMind paves a promising path for the development of open-source general-purpose generative AI systems. Project page:this https URL

  LLM-based (Large Language Model) GUI (Graphical User Interface) agents can potentially reshape our daily lives significantly. However, current LLM-based GUI agents suffer from the scarcity of high-quality training data owing to the difficulties of trajectory collection and reward annotation. Existing works have been exploring LLMs to collect trajectories for imitation learning or to offer reward signals for online RL training. However, the Outcome Reward Model (ORM) used in existing works cannot provide finegrained feedback and can over-penalize the valuable steps in finally failed trajectories. To this end, we propose Progress Reward Model (ProgRM) to provide dense informative intermediate rewards by predicting a task completion progress for each step in online training. To handle the challenge of progress reward label annotation, we further design an efficient LCS-based (Longest Common Subsequence) self-annotation algorithm to discover the key steps in trajectories and assign progress labels accordingly. ProgRM is evaluated with extensive experiments and analyses. Actors trained with ProgRM outperform leading proprietary LLMs and ORM-trained actors, illustrating the effectiveness of ProgRM. The codes for experiments will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

  Project duplication detection is critical for project quality assessment, as it improves resource utilization efficiency by preventing investing in newly proposed project that have already been studied. It requires the ability to understand high-level semantics and generate constructive and valuable feedback. Existing detection methods rely on basic word- or sentence-level comparison or solely apply large language models, lacking valuable insights for experts and in-depth comprehension of project content and review criteria. To tackle this issue, we propose PD$^3$, a Project Duplication Detection framework via adapted multi-agent Debate. Inspired by real-world expert debates, it employs a fair competition format to guide multi-agent debate to retrieve relevant projects. For feedback, it incorporates both qualitative and quantitative analysis to improve its practicality. Over 800 real-world power project data spanning more than 20 specialized fields are used to evaluate the framework, demonstrating that our method outperforms existing approaches by 7.43% and 8.00% in two downstream tasks. Furthermore, we establish an online platform, Review Dingdang, to assist power experts, saving 5.73 million USD in initial detection on more than 100 newly proposed projects.

  Advancing planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is one of the key prerequisites towards unlocking their potential for performing reliably in complex and impactful domains. In this paper, we aim to demonstrate this across board games (Chess, Fischer Random / Chess960, Connect Four, and Hex), and we show that search-based planning can yield significant improvements in LLM game-playing strength. We introduce, compare and contrast two major approaches: In external search, the model guides Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts and evaluations without calls to an external game engine, and in internal search, the model is trained to generate in-context a linearized tree of search and a resulting final choice. Both build on a language model pre-trained on relevant domain knowledge, reliably capturing the transition and value functions in the respective environments, with minimal hallucinations. We evaluate our LLM search implementations against game-specific state-of-the-art engines, showcasing substantial improvements in strength over the base model, and reaching Grandmaster-level performance in chess while operating closer to the human search budget. Our proposed approach, combining search with domain knowledge, is not specific to board games, hinting at more general future applications.

  Automatically evaluating multimodal generation presents a significant challenge, as automated metrics often struggle to align reliably with human evaluation, especially for complex tasks that involve multiple modalities. To address this, we present MMMG, a comprehensive and human-aligned benchmark for multimodal generation across 4 modality combinations (image, audio, interleaved text and image, interleaved text and audio), with a focus on tasks that present significant challenges for generation models, while still enabling reliable automatic evaluation through a combination of models and programs. MMMG encompasses 49 tasks (including 29 newly developed ones), each with a carefully designed evaluation pipeline, and 937 instructions to systematically assess reasoning, controllability, and other key capabilities of multimodal generation models. Extensive validation demonstrates that MMMG is highly aligned with human evaluation, achieving an average agreement of 94.3%. Benchmarking results on 24 multimodal generation models reveal that even though the state-of-the-art model, GPT Image, achieves 78.3% accuracy for image generation, it falls short on multimodal reasoning and interleaved generation. Furthermore, results suggest considerable headroom for improvement in audio generation, highlighting an important direction for future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite remarkable advances in the field, LLMs remain unreliable in distinguishing causation from correlation. Recent results from the Corr2Cause dataset benchmark reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs -- such as GPT-4 (F1 score: 29.08) -- only marginally outperform random baselines (Random Uniform, F1 score: 20.38), indicating limited capacity of generalization. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel structured approach: rather than directly answering causal queries, we provide the model with the capability to structure its thinking by guiding the model to build a structured knowledge graph, systematically encoding the provided correlational premises, to answer the causal queries. This intermediate representation significantly enhances the model's causal capabilities. Experiments on the test subset of the Corr2Cause dataset benchmark with Qwen3-32B model (reasoning model) show substantial gains over standard direct prompting methods, improving F1 scores from 32.71 to 48.26 (over 47.5% relative increase), along with notable improvements in precision and recall. These results underscore the effectiveness of providing the model with the capability to structure its thinking and highlight its promising potential for broader generalization across diverse causal inference tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid progress in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) generation has created an urgent need for interpretable automatic evaluation methods that can assess the quality of generated images, therefore reducing the human annotation burden. To reduce the prohibitive cost of relying on commercial models for large-scale evaluation, and to improve the reasoning capabilities of open-source models, recent research has explored supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as dedicated T2I evaluators. However, SFT approaches typically rely on high-quality critique datasets, which are either generated by proprietary LLMs-with potential issues of bias and inconsistency-or annotated by humans at high cost, limiting their scalability and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-Eval-R1, a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains open-source MLLMs using only coarse-grained quality scores, thereby avoiding the need for annotating high-quality interpretable evaluation rationale. Our approach integrates Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the instruction-tuning process, enabling models to generate both scalar scores and interpretable reasoning chains with only easy accessible annotated judgment scores or preferences. Furthermore, we introduce a continuous reward formulation that encourages score diversity and provides stable optimization signals, leading to more robust and discriminative evaluation behavior. Experimental results on three established T2I meta-evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that T2I-Eval-R1 achieves significantly higher alignment with human assessments and offers more accurate interpretable score rationales compared to strong baseline methods.

  Doctor-patient consultations require multi-turn, context-aware communication tailored to diverse patient personas. Training or evaluating doctor LLMs in such settings requires realistic patient interaction systems. However, existing simulators often fail to reflect the full range of personas seen in clinical practice. To address this, we introduce PatientSim, a patient simulator that generates realistic and diverse patient personas for clinical scenarios, grounded in medical expertise. PatientSim operates using: 1) clinical profiles, including symptoms and medical history, derived from real-world data in the MIMIC-ED and MIMIC-IV datasets, and 2) personas defined by four axes: personality, language proficiency, medical history recall level, and cognitive confusion level, resulting in 37 unique combinations. We evaluated eight LLMs for factual accuracy and persona consistency. The top-performing open-source model, Llama 3.3, was validated by four clinicians to confirm the robustness of our framework. As an open-source, customizable platform, PatientSim provides a reproducible and scalable solution that can be customized for specific training needs. Offering a privacy-compliant environment, it serves as a robust testbed for evaluating medical dialogue systems across diverse patient presentations and shows promise as an educational tool for healthcare.

  This work presents a dual-agent Large Language Model (LLM)-based reasoning method for mechanism synthesis, capable of reasoning at both linguistic and symbolic levels to generate geometrical and dynamic outcomes. The model consists of a composition of well-defined functions that, starting from a natural language specification, references abstract properties through supporting equations, generates and parametrizes simulation code, and elicits feedback anchor points using symbolic regression and distance functions. This process closes an actionable refinement loop at the linguistic and symbolic layers. The approach is shown to be both effective and convergent in the context of planar mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce MSynth, a novel benchmark for planar mechanism synthesis, and perform a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the model components. We further demonstrate that symbolic regression prompts unlock mechanistic insights only when applied to sufficiently large architectures.

  Concepts represent generalized abstractions that enable humans to categorize and reason efficiently, yet it is unclear to what extent Large Language Models (LLMs) comprehend these semantic relationships. Existing benchmarks typically focus on factual recall and isolated tasks, failing to evaluate the ability of LLMs to understand conceptual boundaries. To address this gap, we introduce CK-Arena, a multi-agent interaction game built upon the Undercover game, designed to evaluate the capacity of LLMs to reason with concepts in interactive settings. CK-Arena challenges models to describe, differentiate, and infer conceptual boundaries based on partial information, encouraging models to explore commonalities and distinctions between closely related concepts. By simulating real-world interaction, CK-Arena provides a scalable and realistic benchmark for assessing conceptual reasoning in dynamic environments. Experimental results show that LLMs' understanding of conceptual knowledge varies significantly across different categories and is not strictly aligned with parameter size or general model capabilities.

  Recent reasoning-oriented LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on challenging tasks such as mathematics and science examinations. However, core cognitive faculties of human intelligence, such as abstract reasoning and generalization, remain underexplored. To address this, we evaluate recent reasoning-oriented LLMs on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, which explicitly demands both faculties. We formulate ARC as a program synthesis task and propose nine candidate solvers. Experimental results show that repeated-sampling planning-aided code generation (RSPC) achieves the highest test accuracy and demonstrates consistent generalization across most LLMs. To further improve performance, we introduce an ARC solver, Knowledge Augmentation for Abstract Reasoning (KAAR), which encodes core knowledge priors within an ontology that classifies priors into three hierarchical levels based on their dependencies. KAAR progressively expands LLM reasoning capacity by gradually augmenting priors at each level, and invokes RSPC to generate candidate solutions after each augmentation stage. This stage-wise reasoning reduces interference from irrelevant priors and improves LLM performance. Empirical results show that KAAR maintains strong generalization and consistently outperforms non-augmented RSPC across all evaluated LLMs, achieving around 5% absolute gains and up to 64.52% relative improvement. Despite these achievements, ARC remains a challenging benchmark for reasoning-oriented LLMs, highlighting future avenues of progress in LLMs.

  Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, but often suffer from overthinking, generating redundant content regardless of task difficulty. Inspired by the dual process theory in cognitive science, we propose Adaptive Cognition Policy Optimization (ACPO), a reinforcement learning framework that enables LRMs to achieve efficient reasoning through adaptive cognitive allocation and dynamic system switch. ACPO incorporates two key components: (1) introducing system-aware reasoning tokens to explicitly represent the thinking modes thereby making the model's cognitive process transparent, and (2) integrating online difficulty estimation and token length budget to guide adaptive system switch and reasoning during reinforcement learning. To this end, we propose a two-stage training strategy. The first stage begins with supervised fine-tuning to cold start the model, enabling it to generate reasoning paths with explicit thinking modes. In the second stage, we apply ACPO to further enhance adaptive system switch for difficulty-aware reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that ACPO effectively reduces redundant reasoning while adaptively adjusting cognitive allocation based on task complexity, achieving efficient hybrid reasoning.

  Recently, large reasoning models demonstrate exceptional performance on various tasks. However, reasoning models inefficiently over-process both trivial and complex queries, leading to resource waste and prolonged user latency. To address this challenge, we propose SelfBudgeter - a self-adaptive controllable reasoning strategy for efficient reasoning. Our approach adopts a dual-phase training paradigm: first, the model learns to pre-estimate the reasoning cost based on the difficulty of the query. Then, we introduce budget-guided GPRO for reinforcement learning, which effectively maintains accuracy while reducing output length. SelfBudgeter allows users to anticipate generation time and make informed decisions about continuing or interrupting the process. Furthermore, our method enables direct manipulation of reasoning length via pre-filling token budget. Experimental results demonstrate that SelfBudgeter can rationally allocate budgets according to problem complexity, achieving up to 74.47% response length compression on the MATH benchmark while maintaining nearly undiminished accuracy.

  Despite the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in various reasoning tasks, they still struggle with table reasoning tasks, particularly in maintaining consistency throughout multi-step reasoning processes. While existing approaches have explored various decomposition strategies, they often lack effective mechanisms to identify and correct errors in intermediate reasoning steps, leading to cascading error propagation. To address these issues, we propose Table-Critic, a novel multi-agent framework that facilitates collaborative criticism and iterative refinement of the reasoning process until convergence to correct solutions. Our framework consists of four specialized agents: a Judge for error identification, a Critic for comprehensive critiques, a Refiner for process improvement, and a Curator for pattern distillation. To effectively deal with diverse and unpredictable error types, we introduce a self-evolving template tree that systematically accumulates critique knowledge through experience-driven learning and guides future reflections. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that Table-Critic achieves substantial improvements over existing methods, achieving superior accuracy and error correction rates while maintaining computational efficiency and lower solution degradation rate.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks by leveraging test-time computation. However, existing parallel scaling methods, such as repeated sampling or reward model scoring, often suffer from premature convergence and high costs due to task-specific reward model training, while sequential methods like SELF-REFINE cannot effectively leverage increased compute. This paper introduces Self-Enhanced Test-Time Scaling (SETS), a new approach that overcomes these limitations by strategically combining parallel and sequential techniques. SETS exploits the inherent self-verification and self-correction capabilities of LLMs, unifying sampling, verification, and correction within a single framework. This innovative design facilitates efficient and scalable test-time computation for enhanced performance on complex tasks. Our comprehensive experimental results on challenging benchmarks spanning planning, reasoning, math, and coding demonstrate that SETS achieves significant performance improvements and more advantageous test-time scaling behavior than the alternatives.

  Integrating tools into Large Language Models (LLMs) has facilitated the widespread application. Despite this, in specialized downstream task contexts, reliance solely on tools is insufficient to fully address the complexities of the real world. This particularly restricts the effective deployment of LLMs in fields such as medicine. In this paper, we focus on the downstream tasks of medical calculators, which use standardized tests to assess an individual's health status. We introduce MeNTi, a universal agent architecture for LLMs. MeNTi integrates a specialized medical toolkit and employs meta-tool and nested calling mechanisms to enhance LLM tool utilization. Specifically, it achieves flexible tool selection and nested tool calling to address practical issues faced in intricate medical scenarios, including calculator selection, slot filling, and unit conversion. To assess the capabilities of LLMs for quantitative assessment throughout the clinical process of calculator scenarios, we introduce CalcQA. This benchmark requires LLMs to use medical calculators to perform calculations and assess patient health status. CalcQA is constructed by professional physicians and includes 100 case-calculator pairs, complemented by a toolkit of 281 medical tools. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements with our framework. This research paves new directions for applying LLMs in demanding scenarios of medicine.

  Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve promising performance on visual and audio benchmarks independently. However, the ability of these models to process cross-modal information synchronously remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce: 1) Daily-Omni, an Audio-Visual Questioning and Answering benchmark comprising 684 videos of daily life scenarios from diverse sources, rich in both audio and visual information, and featuring 1197 multiple-choice QA pairs across 6 major tasks; 2) Daily-Omni QA Generation Pipeline, which includes automatic annotation, QA generation and QA optimization, significantly improves efficiency for human evaluation and scalability of the benchmark; 3) Daily-Omni-Agent, a training-free agent utilizing open-source Visual Language Model (VLM), Audio Language Model (ALM) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model to establish a baseline for this benchmark. The results show that current MLLMs still struggle significantly with tasks requiring audio-visual integration, but combining VLMs and ALMs with simple temporal alignment techniques can achieve substantially better performance.

  Autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) are useful for automating complex tasks but raise trust concerns due to risks like miscoordination and goal misalignment. Explainability is vital for trust calibration, but explainable reinforcement learning for MAS faces challenges in state/action space complexity, stakeholder needs, and evaluation. Using the counterfactual theory of causation and LLMs' summarisation capabilities, we propose Agentic eXplanations via Interrogative Simulation (AXIS). AXIS generates intelligible causal explanations for pre-trained multi-agent policies by having an LLM interrogate an environment simulator using queries like 'whatif' and 'remove' to observe and synthesise counterfactual information over multiple rounds. We evaluate AXIS on autonomous driving across 10 scenarios for 5 LLMs with a novel evaluation methodology combining subjective preference, correctness, and goal/action prediction metrics, and an external LLM as evaluator. Compared to baselines, AXIS improves perceived explanation correctness by at least 7.7% across all models and goal prediction accuracy by 23% for 4 models, with improved or comparable action prediction accuracy, achieving the highest scores overall.

  Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-world applications such as "digital assistants, autonomous customer service, and decision-support systems", where their ability to "interact in multi-turn, tool-augmented environments" makes them indispensable. However, ensuring the safety of these agents remains a significant challenge due to the diverse and complex risks arising from dynamic user interactions, external tool usage, and the potential for unintended harmful behaviors. To address this critical issue, we propose AutoSafe, the first framework that systematically enhances agent safety through fully automated synthetic data generation. Concretely, 1) we introduce an open and extensible threat model, OTS, which formalizes how unsafe behaviors emerge from the interplay of user instructions, interaction contexts, and agent actions. This enables precise modeling of safety risks across diverse scenarios. 2) we develop a fully automated data generation pipeline that simulates unsafe user behaviors, applies self-reflective reasoning to generate safe responses, and constructs a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality safety training dataset-eliminating the need for hazardous real-world data collection. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we design comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world safety benchmarks. Results demonstrate that AutoSafe boosts safety scores by 45% on average and achieves a 28.91% improvement on real-world tasks, validating the generalization ability of our learned safety strategies. These results highlight the practical advancement and scalability of AutoSafe in building safer LLM-based agents for real-world deployment. We have released the project page atthis https URL.

  Most LLM-based agent frameworks adopt a top-down philosophy: humans decompose tasks, define workflows, and assign agents to execute each step. While effective on benchmark-style tasks, such systems rely on designer updates and overlook agents' potential to learn from experience. Recently, Silver and Sutton(2025) envision a shift into a new era, where agents could progress from a stream of experiences. In this paper, we instantiate this vision of experience-driven learning by introducing a bottom-up agent paradigm that mirrors the human learning process. Agents acquire competence through a trial-and-reasoning mechanism-exploring, reflecting on outcomes, and abstracting skills over time. Once acquired, skills can be rapidly shared and extended, enabling continual evolution rather than static replication. As more agents are deployed, their diverse experiences accelerate this collective process, making bottom-up design especially suited for open-ended environments. We evaluate this paradigm in Slay the Spire and Civilization V, where agents perceive through raw visual inputs and act via mouse outputs, the same as human players. Using a unified, game-agnostic codebase without any game-specific prompts or privileged APIs, our bottom-up agents acquire skills entirely through autonomous interaction, demonstrating the potential of the bottom-up paradigm in complex, real-world environments.

  Geometric spatial reasoning forms the foundation of many applications in artificial intelligence, yet the ability of large language models (LLMs) to operate over geometric spatial information expressed in procedural code remains underexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by formalizing the Program-to-Geometry task, which challenges models to translate programmatic drawing code into accurate and abstract geometric reasoning. To evaluate this capability, we present GeoGramBench, a benchmark of 500 carefully refined problems organized by a tailored three-level taxonomy that considers geometric complexity rather than traditional mathematical reasoning complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier LLMs reveals consistent and pronounced deficiencies: even the most advanced models achieve less than 50% accuracy at the highest abstraction level. These results highlight the unique challenges posed by program-driven spatial reasoning and establish GeoGramBench as a valuable resource for advancing research in symbolic-to-spatial geometric reasoning.

  Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically employ a connector module to link visual features with text embeddings of large language models (LLMs) and use end-to-end training to achieve multi-modal understanding in a unified process. Well alignment needs high-quality pre-training data and a carefully designed training process. Current LVLMs face challenges when addressing complex vision-language reasoning tasks, with their reasoning capabilities notably lagging behind those of LLMs. This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of training end-to-end vision-language reasoning models, we advocate for developing a decoupled reasoning framework based on existing visual interpretation specialists and text-based reasoning LLMs. Our approach leverages (1) a dedicated vision-language model to transform the visual content of images into textual descriptions and (2) an LLM to perform reasoning according to the visual-derived text and the original question. This method presents a cost-efficient solution for multi-modal model development by optimizing existing models to work collaboratively, avoiding end-to-end development of vision-language models from scratch. By transforming images into language model-compatible text representations, it facilitates future low-cost and flexible upgrades to upcoming powerful LLMs. We introduce an outcome-rewarded joint-tuning strategy to optimize the cooperation between the visual interpretation and linguistic reasoning model. Evaluation results on vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that the decoupled reasoning framework outperforms recent LVLMs. Our approach yields particularly significant performance gains on visually intensive geometric mathematics problems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown emerging potential in spatiotemporal reasoning, making them promising candidates for building urban agents that support diverse urban downstream applications. Despite these benefits, existing studies primarily focus on evaluating urban LLM agent on outcome-level metrics (e.g., prediction accuracy, traffic efficiency), offering limited insight into their underlying reasoning processes. As a result, the strengths and limitations of urban LLM agents in spatiotemporal reasoning remain poorly understood. To this end, we introduce USTBench, the first benchmark to evaluate LLMs' spatiotemporal reasoning abilities as urban agents across four decomposed dimensions: spatiotemporal understanding, forecasting, planning, and reflection with feedback. Specifically, USTBench supports five diverse urban decision-making and four spatiotemporal prediction tasks, all running within our constructed interactive city environment UAgentEnv. The benchmark includes 62,466 structured QA pairs for process-level evaluation and standardized end-to-end task assessments, enabling fine-grained diagnostics and broad task-level comparison across diverse urban scenarios. Through extensive evaluation of thirteen leading LLMs, we reveal that although LLMs show promising potential across various urban downstream tasks, they still struggle in long-horizon planning and reflective adaptation in dynamic urban contexts. Notably, recent advanced reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) trained on general logic or mathematical problems do not consistently outperform non-reasoning LLMs. This discrepancy highlights the need for domain-specialized adaptation methods to enhance urban spatiotemporal reasoning. Overall, USTBench provides a foundation to build more adaptive and effective LLM-based urban agents and broad smart city applications.

  Integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown the potential to provide precise, contextually relevant responses in knowledge intensive domains. This study investigates the ap-plication of RAG for ABB circuit breakers, focusing on accuracy, reliability, and contextual relevance in high-stakes engineering environments. By leveraging tailored datasets, advanced embedding models, and optimized chunking strategies, the research addresses challenges in data retrieval and contextual alignment unique to engineering documentation. Key contributions include the development of a domain-specific dataset for ABB circuit breakers and the evaluation of three RAG pipelines: OpenAI GPT4o, Cohere, and Anthropic Claude. Advanced chunking methods, such as paragraph-based and title-aware segmentation, are assessed for their impact on retrieval accuracy and response generation. Results demonstrate that while certain configurations achieve high precision and relevancy, limitations persist in ensuring factual faithfulness and completeness, critical in engineering contexts. This work underscores the need for iterative improvements in RAG systems to meet the stringent demands of electrical engineering tasks, including design, troubleshooting, and operational decision-making. The findings in this paper help advance research of AI in highly technical domains such as electrical engineering.

  To advance biomedical vison-language model capabilities through scaling up, fine-tuning, and instruction tuning, develop vision-language models with improved performance in handling long text, explore strategies to efficiently adopt vision language models for diverse multi-modal biomedical tasks, and examine the zero-shot learning performance.We developed two biomedical vision language models, BiomedGPT-Large and BiomedGPT-XLarge, based on an encoder-decoder-based transformer architecture. We fine-tuned the two models on 23 benchmark datasets from 6 multi-modal biomedical tasks including one image-only task (image classification), three language-only tasks (text understanding, text summarization and question answering), and two vision-language tasks (visual question answering and image captioning). We compared the developed scaled models with our previous BiomedGPT-Base model and existing prestigious models reported in the literature. We instruction-tuned the two models using a large-scale multi-modal biomedical instruction-tuning dataset and assessed the zero-shot learning performance and alignment accuracy.

  LLMs' decision-making process is opaque, prompting the need for explanation techniques like Chain-of-Thought. To investigate the relationship between answer and reasoning, we design a novel evaluation framework, MATCHA. In domains like education and healthcare, reasoning is key for model trustworthiness. MATCHA reveals that LLMs under input perturbations can give inconsistent or nonsensical reasoning. Additionally, we use LLM judges to assess reasoning robustness across models. Our results show that LLMs exhibit greater vulnerability to input perturbations for multi-step and commonsense tasks than compared to logical tasks. Also, we show non-trivial transfer rates of our successful examples to black-box models. Our evaluation framework helps to better understand LLM reasoning mechanisms and guides future models toward more robust and reasoning-driven architectures, enforcing answer-reasoning consistency.

  Large language models have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in long and complex reasoning tasks. However, they frequently exhibit a problematic reliance on familiar reasoning patterns, a phenomenon we term \textit{reasoning rigidity}. Despite explicit instructions from users, these models often override clearly stated conditions and default to habitual reasoning trajectories, leading to incorrect conclusions. This behavior presents significant challenges, particularly in domains such as mathematics and logic puzzle, where precise adherence to specified constraints is critical. To systematically investigate reasoning rigidity, a behavior largely unexplored in prior work, we introduce a expert-curated diagnostic set, \dataset{}. Our dataset includes specially modified variants of existing mathematical benchmarks, namely AIME and MATH500, as well as well-known puzzles deliberately redesigned to require deviation from familiar reasoning strategies. Using this dataset, we identify recurring contamination patterns that occur when models default to ingrained reasoning. Specifically, we categorize this contamination into three distinctive modes: (i) Interpretation Overload, (ii) Input Distrust, and (iii) Partial Instruction Attention, each causing models to ignore or distort provided instructions. We publicly release our diagnostic set to facilitate future research on mitigating reasoning rigidity in language models.

  Medical deep learning models depend heavily on domain-specific knowledge to perform well on knowledge-intensive clinical tasks. Prior work has primarily leveraged unimodal knowledge graphs, such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), to enhance model performance. However, integrating multimodal medical knowledge graphs remains largely underexplored, mainly due to the lack of resources linking imaging data with clinical concepts. To address this gap, we propose MEDMKG, a Medical Multimodal Knowledge Graph that unifies visual and textual medical information through a multi-stage construction pipeline. MEDMKG fuses the rich multimodal data from MIMIC-CXR with the structured clinical knowledge from UMLS, utilizing both rule-based tools and large language models for accurate concept extraction and relationship modeling. To ensure graph quality and compactness, we introduce Neighbor-aware Filtering (NaF), a novel filtering algorithm tailored for multimodal knowledge graphs. We evaluate MEDMKG across three tasks under two experimental settings, benchmarking twenty-four baseline methods and four state-of-the-art vision-language backbones on six datasets. Results show that MEDMKG not only improves performance in downstream medical tasks but also offers a strong foundation for developing adaptive and robust strategies for multimodal knowledge integration in medical artificial intelligence.

  Large Language Models have achieved remarkable results on a variety of mathematical benchmarks. However, concerns remain as to whether these successes reflect genuine mathematical reasoning or superficial pattern recognition. Common evaluation metrics, such as final answer accuracy, fail to disentangle the underlying competencies involved, offering limited diagnostic value. To address these limitations, we introduce SMART: a Self-Generating and Self-Validating Multi-Dimensional Assessment Framework. SMART decomposes mathematical problem solving into four distinct dimensions: understanding, reasoning, arithmetic, and reflection \& refinement. Each dimension is evaluated independently through tailored tasks, enabling interpretable and fine-grained analysis of LLM behavior. Crucially, SMART integrates an automated self-generating and self-validating mechanism to produce and verify benchmark data, ensuring both scalability and reliability. We apply SMART to 21 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LLMs, uncovering significant discrepancies in their abilities across different dimensions. Our findings demonstrate the inadequacy of final answer accuracy as a sole metric and motivate a new holistic metric to better capture true problem-solving capabilities. Code and benchmarks will be released upon acceptance.

  Recent studies have revealed that human emotions exhibit a high-dimensional, complex structure. A full capturing of this complexity requires new approaches, as conventional models that disregard high dimensionality risk overlooking key nuances of human emotions. Here, we examined the extent to which the latest generation of rapidly evolving Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capture these high-dimensional, intricate emotion structures, including capabilities and limitations. Specifically, we compared self-reported emotion ratings from participants watching videos with model-generated estimates (e.g., Gemini or GPT). We evaluated performance not only at the individual video level but also from emotion structures that account for inter-video relationships. At the level of simple correlation between emotion structures, our results demonstrated strong similarity between human and model-inferred emotion structures. To further explore whether the similarity between humans and models is at the signle item level or the coarse-categorical level, we applied Gromov Wasserstein Optimal Transport. We found that although performance was not necessarily high at the strict, single-item level, performance across video categories that elicit similar emotions was substantial, indicating that the model could infer human emotional experiences at the category level. Our results suggest that current state-of-the-art MLLMs broadly capture the complex high-dimensional emotion structures at the category level, as well as their apparent limitations in accurately capturing entire structures at the single-item level.

  Acquiring the parameters of neural networks (NNs) has been one of the most important problems in machine learning since the inception of NNs. Traditional approaches, such as backpropagation and forward-only optimization, acquire parameters via iterative data fitting to gradually optimize them. This paper aims to explore the feasibility of a new direction: acquiring NN parameters via large language model generation. We propose NeuroGen, a generalized and easy-to-implement two-stage approach for NN parameter generation conditioned on descriptions of the data, task, and network architecture. Stage one is Parameter Reference Knowledge Injection, where LLMs are pretrained on NN checkpoints to build foundational understanding of parameter space, whereas stage two is Context-Enhanced Instruction Tuning, enabling LLMs to adapt to specific tasks through enriched, task-aware prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that NeuroGen effectively generates usable NN parameters. Our findings highlight the feasibility of LLM-based NN parameter generation and suggest a promising new paradigm where LLMs and lightweight NNs can coexist synergistically

  Large language model powered autonomous agents demand robust, standardized protocols to integrate tools, share contextual data, and coordinate tasks across heterogeneous systems. Ad-hoc integrations are difficult to scale, secure, and generalize across domains. This survey examines four emerging agent communication protocols: Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), and Agent Network Protocol (ANP), each addressing interoperability in deployment contexts. MCP provides a JSON-RPC client-server interface for secure tool invocation and typed data exchange. ACP defines a general-purpose communication protocol over RESTful HTTP, supporting MIME-typed multipart messages and synchronous and asynchronous interactions. Its lightweight and runtime-independent design enables scalable agent invocation, while features like session management, message routing, and integration with role-based and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). A2A enables peer-to-peer task delegation using capability-based Agent Cards, supporting secure and scalable collaboration across enterprise agent workflows. ANP supports open network agent discovery and secure collaboration using W3C decentralized identifiers DIDs and JSON-LD graphs. The protocols are compared across multiple dimensions, including interaction modes, discovery mechanisms, communication patterns, and security models. Based on the comparative analysis, a phased adoption roadmap is proposed: beginning with MCP for tool access, followed by ACP for structured, multimodal messaging session-aware interaction and both online and offline agent discovery across scalable, HTTP-based deployments A2A for collaborative task execution, and extending to ANP for decentralized agent marketplaces. This work provides a comprehensive foundation for designing secure, interoperable, and scalable ecosystems of LLM-powered agents.

  This monograph presents a modular cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence grounded in the formal modeling of belief as structured semantic state. Belief states are defined as dynamic ensembles of linguistic expressions embedded within a navigable manifold, where operators enable assimilation, abstraction, nullification, memory, and introspection. Drawing from philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we develop a layered framework that enables self-regulating epistemic agents capable of reflective, goal-directed thought. At the core of this framework is the epistemic vacuum: a class of semantically inert cognitive states that serves as the conceptual origin of belief space. From this foundation, the Null Tower arises as a generative structure recursively built through internal representational capacities. The theoretical constructs are designed to be implementable in both symbolic and neural systems, including large language models, hybrid agents, and adaptive memory architectures. This work offers a foundational substrate for constructing agents that reason, remember, and regulate their beliefs in structured, interpretable ways.

  Time series data measure how environments change over time and drive decision-making in critical domains like finance and healthcare. A common goal in analyzing time series data is to understand the underlying events that cause the observed variations. We conduct the first study of whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer events described with natural language from time series data. We evaluate 18 LLMs on a task to match event sequences with real-valued time series data using a new benchmark we develop using sports data. Several current LLMs demonstrate promising abilities, with OpenAI's o1 performing the best but with DS-R1-distill-Qwen-32B outperforming proprietary models such as GPT-4o. From insights derived from analyzing reasoning failures, we also find clear avenues to improve performance. By applying post-training optimizations, i.e., distillation and self-improvement, we significantly enhance the performance of the Qwen2.5 1.5B, achieving results second only to o1.

  Feedback is crucial for every design process, such as user interface (UI) design, and automating design critiques can significantly improve the efficiency of the design workflow. Although existing multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks, they often struggle with generating high-quality design critiques -- a complex task that requires producing detailed design comments that are visually grounded in a given design's image. Building on recent advancements in iterative refinement of text output and visual prompting methods, we propose an iterative visual prompting approach for UI critique that takes an input UI screenshot and design guidelines and generates a list of design comments, along with corresponding bounding boxes that map each comment to a specific region in the screenshot. The entire process is driven completely by LLMs, which iteratively refine both the text output and bounding boxes using few-shot samples tailored for each step. We evaluated our approach using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o, and found that human experts generally preferred the design critiques generated by our pipeline over those by the baseline, with the pipeline reducing the gap from human performance by 50% for one rating metric. To assess the generalizability of our approach to other multimodal tasks, we applied our pipeline to open-vocabulary object and attribute detection, and experiments showed that our method also outperformed the baseline.
