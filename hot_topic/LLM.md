- **[Collaborating Action by Action: A Multi-agent LLM Framework for Embodied Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17950)**  `arXiv:2504.17950`  `cs.MA` `cs.CL`

  Collaboration is ubiquitous and essential in day-to-day life -- from exchanging ideas, to delegating tasks, to generating plans together. This work studies how LLMs can adaptively collaborate to perform complex embodied reasoning tasks. To this end we introduce MINDcraft, an easily extensible platform built to enable LLM agents to control characters in the open-world game of Minecraft; and MineCollab, a benchmark to test the different dimensions of embodied and collaborative reasoning. An experimental study finds that the primary bottleneck in collaborating effectively for current state-of-the-art agents is efficient natural language communication, with agent performance dropping as much as 15% when they are required to communicate detailed task completion plans. We conclude that existing LLM agents are ill-optimized for multi-agent collaboration, especially in embodied scenarios, and highlight the need to employ methods beyond in-context and imitation learning.

- **[Leveraging Label Semantics and Meta-Label Refinement for Multi-Label Question Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01841)**  `arXiv:2411.01841`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  Accurate annotation of educational resources is crucial for effective personalized learning and resource recommendation in online education. However, fine-grained knowledge labels often overlap or share similarities, making it difficult for existing multi-label classification methods to differentiate them. The label distribution imbalance due to sparsity of human annotations further intensifies these challenges. To address these issues, this paper introduces RR2QC, a novel Retrieval Reranking method to multi-label Question Classification by leveraging label semantics and meta-label refinement. First, RR2QC improves the pre-training strategy by utilizing semantic relationships within and across label groups. Second, it introduces a class center learning task to align questions with label semantics during downstream training. Finally, this method decomposes labels into meta-labels and uses a meta-label classifier to rerank the retrieved label sequences. In doing so, RR2QC enhances the understanding and prediction capability of long-tail labels by learning from meta-labels that frequently appear in other labels. Additionally, a mathematical LLM is used to generate solutions for questions, extracting latent information to further refine the model's insights. Experimental results show that RR2QC outperforms existing methods in Precision@K and F1 scores across multiple educational datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for online education applications.

- **[Towards Robust and Parameter-Efficient Knowledge Unlearning for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06621)**  `arXiv:2408.06621`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning and memorization capabilities via pretraining on massive textual corpora. However, this poses risk of privacy and copyright violations, highlighting the need for efficient machine unlearning methods that remove sensitive data without retraining from scratch. While Gradient Ascent (GA) is commonly used to unlearn by reducing the likelihood of generating unwanted content, it leads to unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting of retrained knowledge. We find that combining GA with low-rank adaptation results in poor trade-offs between computational cost and generative performance. To address these challenges, we propose Low-rank Knowledge Unlearning (LoKU), a novel framework that enables robust and efficient unlearning for LLMs. First, we introduce Inverted Hinge Loss, which suppresses unwanted tokens while maintaining fluency by boosting the probability of the next most likely token. Second, we develop a data-adaptive initialization for LoRA adapters via low-rank approximation weighted with relative Fisher information, thereby focusing updates on parameters critical for removing targeted knowledge. Experiments on the Training Data Extraction Challenge dataset using GPT-Neo models as well as on the TOFU benchmark with Phi-1.5B and Llama2-7B models demonstrate that our approach effectively removes sensitive information while maintaining reasoning and generative capabilities with minimal impact. Our implementation can be found inthis https URL.

  Foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Vision Models (LVMs), have emerged as one of the most powerful tools in the respective fields. However, unlike text and image data, graph data do not have a definitive structure, posing great challenges to developing a Graph Foundation Model (GFM). For example, current attempts at designing general graph models either transform graph data into a language format for LLM-based prediction or still train a GNN model with LLM as an assistant. The former can handle unlimited tasks, while the latter captures graph structure much better -- yet, no existing work can achieve both simultaneously. In this paper, we identify three key desirable properties of a GFM: self-supervised pretraining, fluidity in tasks, and graph awareness. To account for these properties, we extend the conventional language modeling to the graph domain and propose a novel generative graph language model GOFA to solve the problem. The model interleaves randomly initialized GNN layers into a frozen pre-trained LLM so that the semantic and structural modeling abilities are organically combined. GOFA is pre-trained on newly proposed graph-level next-word prediction, question-answering, and structural tasks to obtain the above GFM properties. The pre-trained model is further fine-tuned on downstream tasks to obtain task-solving ability. The fine-tuned model is evaluated on various downstream tasks, demonstrating a strong ability to solve structural and contextual problems in zero-shot scenarios. The code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Testing Individual Fairness in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18353)**  `arXiv:2504.18353`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The biases in artificial intelligence (AI) models can lead to automated decision-making processes that discriminate against groups and/or individuals based on sensitive properties such as gender and race. While there are many studies on diagnosing and mitigating biases in various AI models, there is little research on individual fairness in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Unlike traditional models, which treat data features independently and overlook their inter-relationships, GNNs are designed to capture graph-based structure where nodes are interconnected. This relational approach enables GNNs to model complex dependencies, but it also means that biases can propagate through these connections, complicating the detection and mitigation of individual fairness violations. This PhD project aims to develop a testing framework to assess and ensure individual fairness in GNNs. It first systematically reviews the literature on individual fairness, categorizing existing approaches to define, measure, test, and mitigate model biases, creating a taxonomy of individual fairness. Next, the project will develop a framework for testing and ensuring fairness in GNNs by adapting and extending current fairness testing and mitigation techniques. The framework will be evaluated through industrial case studies, focusing on graph-based large language models.

- **[BackSlash: Rate Constrained Optimized Training of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16968)**  `arXiv:2504.16968`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Jun Wu, Jiangtao Wen, Yuxing Han_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of large-language models (LLMs) has driven extensive research into parameter compression after training has been completed, yet compression during the training phase remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce Rate-Constrained Training (BackSlash), a novel training-time compression approach based on rate-distortion optimization (RDO). BackSlash enables a flexible trade-off between model accuracy and complexity, significantly reducing parameter redundancy while preserving performance. Experiments in various architectures and tasks demonstrate that BackSlash can reduce memory usage by 60% - 90% without accuracy loss and provides significant compression gain compared to compression after training. Moreover, BackSlash proves to be highly versatile: it enhances generalization with small Lagrange multipliers, improves model robustness to pruning (maintaining accuracy even at 80% pruning rates), and enables network simplification for accelerated inference on edge devices.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs), with demonstrated reasoning abilities across multiple domains, are largely underexplored for time-series reasoning (TsR), which is ubiquitous in the real world. In this work, we propose TimerBed, the first comprehensive testbed for evaluating LLMs' TsR performance. Specifically, TimerBed includes stratified reasoning patterns with real-world tasks, comprehensive combinations of LLMs and reasoning strategies, and various supervised models as comparison anchors. We perform extensive experiments with TimerBed, test multiple current beliefs, and verify the initial failures of LLMs in TsR, evidenced by the ineffectiveness of zero shot (ZST) and performance degradation of few shot in-context learning (ICL). Further, we identify one possible root cause: the numerical modeling of data. To address this, we propose a prompt-based solution VL-Time, using visualization-modeled data and language-guided reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Vl-Time enables multimodal LLMs to be non-trivial ZST and powerful ICL reasoners for time series, achieving about 140% average performance improvement and 99% average token costs reduction.

- **[Pseudo-Asynchronous Local SGD: Robust and Efficient Data-Parallel Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18454)**  `arXiv:2504.18454`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Following AI scaling trends, frontier models continue to grow in size and continue to be trained on larger datasets. Training these models requires huge investments in exascale computational resources, which has in turn driven development of distributed deep learning methods. Data parallelism is an essential approach to speed up training, but it requires frequent global communication between workers, which can bottleneck training at the largest scales. In this work, we propose a method called Pseudo-Asynchronous Local SGD (PALSGD) to improve the efficiency of data-parallel training. PALSGD is an extension of Local SGD (Stich, 2018) and DiLoCo (Douillard et al., 2023), designed to further reduce communication frequency by introducing a pseudo-synchronization mechanism. PALSGD allows the use of longer synchronization intervals compared to standard Local SGD. Despite the reduced communication frequency, the pseudo-synchronization approach ensures that model consistency is maintained, leading to performance results comparable to those achieved with more frequent synchronization. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of PALSGD, establishing its convergence and deriving its convergence rate. This analysis offers insights into the algorithm's behavior and performance guarantees. We evaluated PALSGD on image classification and language modeling tasks. Our results show that PALSGD achieves better performance in less time compared to existing methods like Distributed Data Parallel (DDP), and DiLoCo. Notably, PALSGD trains 18.4% faster than DDP on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-50, 24.4% faster than DDP on TinyStories with GPT-Neo125M, and 21.1% faster than DDP on TinyStories with GPT-Neo-8M.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in programming and mathematical reasoning tasks, but are constrained by limited high-quality training data. Synthetic data can be leveraged to enhance fine-tuning outcomes, but several factors influence this process, including model size, synthetic data volume, pruning strategy, and number of fine-tuning rounds. We explore these axes and investigate which conditions enable model self-improvement. We introduce the Think, Prune, Train process, a scalable framework that iteratively fine-tunes models on their own reasoning traces, using ground-truth pruning to ensure high-quality training data. This approach yields improved performance: on GSM8K, Gemma2-2B achieves a Pass@1 of 57.6% (from 41.9%), Gemma2-9B reaches 82%, matching LLaMA-3.1-70B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B attains 91%, even surpassing GPT-4o, demonstrating the effectiveness of self-generated reasoning and systematic data selection for improving LLM capabilities.

- **[TimeSoccer: An End-to-End Multimodal Large Language Model for Soccer Commentary Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17365)**  `arXiv:2504.17365`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Soccer is a globally popular sporting event, typically characterized by long matches and distinctive highlight moments. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities in temporal grounding and video understanding, soccer commentary generation often requires precise temporal localization and semantically rich descriptions over long-form video. However, existing soccer MLLMs often rely on the temporal a priori for caption generation, so they cannot process the soccer video end-to-end. While some traditional approaches follow a two-step paradigm that is complex and fails to capture the global context to achieve suboptimal performance. To solve the above issues, we present TimeSoccer, the first end-to-end soccer MLLM for Single-anchor Dense Video Captioning (SDVC) in full-match soccer videos. TimeSoccer jointly predicts timestamps and generates captions in a single pass, enabling global context modeling across 45-minute matches. To support long video understanding of soccer matches, we introduce MoFA-Select, a training-free, motion-aware frame compression module that adaptively selects representative frames via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and incorporates complementary training paradigms to strengthen the model's ability to handle long temporal sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TimeSoccer achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on the SDVC task in an end-to-end form, generating high-quality commentary with accurate temporal alignment and strong semantic relevance.

  Multilingual capability is an essential aspect for large multimodal models, since they are usually deployed across various countries and languages. However, most existing benchmarks for multilingual multimodal reasoning struggle to differentiate between models of varying performance; even language models without visual capabilities can easily achieve high scores. This leaves a comprehensive evaluation of leading multilingual multimodal models largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce M4U, a novel and challenging benchmark for assessing the capability of multi-discipline multilingual multimodal understanding and reasoning. M4U contains 10k samples covering 64 disciplines across 16 subfields in Science, Engineering, and Healthcare in six languages. Using M4U, we conduct extensive evaluations of leading Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools. The evaluation results demonstrate that the state-of-the-art model, GPT-4o, achieves only 47.6% average accuracy on M4U. Additionally, we observe that the leading LMMs exhibit significant language preferences. Our in-depth analysis indicates that leading LMMs, including GPT-4o, struggle to perform reasoning using multilingual information present in both visual and textual context. Specifically, they suffer performance degradation when prompted with cross-lingual multimodal questions. Our code and dataset is public available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Widely shared videos on the internet are often edited. Recently, although Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) have made great progress in general video understanding tasks, their capabilities in video editing understanding (VEU) tasks remain unexplored. To address this gap, in this paper, we introduce VEU-Bench (Video Editing Understanding Benchmark), a comprehensive benchmark that categorizes video editing components across various dimensions, from intra-frame features like shot size to inter-shot attributes such as cut types and transitions. Unlike previous video editing understanding benchmarks that focus mainly on editing element classification, VEU-Bench encompasses 19 fine-grained tasks across three stages: recognition, reasoning, and judging. To enhance the annotation of VEU automatically, we built an annotation pipeline integrated with an ontology-based knowledge base. Through extensive experiments with 11 state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs, our findings reveal that current Vid-LLMs face significant challenges in VEU tasks, with some performing worse than random choice. To alleviate this issue, we develop Oscars, a VEU expert model fine-tuned on the curated VEU-Bench dataset. It outperforms existing open-source Vid-LLMs on VEU-Bench by over 28.3% in accuracy and achieves performance comparable to commercial models like GPT-4o. We also demonstrate that incorporating VEU data significantly enhances the performance of Vid-LLMs on general video understanding benchmarks, with an average improvement of 8.3% across nine reasoning tasks.

  Despite the unprecedented progress in the field of 3D generation, current systems still often fail to produce high-quality 3D assets that are visually appealing and geometrically and semantically consistent across multiple viewpoints. To effectively assess the quality of the generated 3D data, there is a need for a reliable 3D evaluation tool. Unfortunately, existing 3D evaluation metrics often overlook the geometric quality of generated assets or merely rely on black-box multimodal large language models for coarse assessment. In this paper, we introduce Eval3D, a fine-grained, interpretable evaluation tool that can faithfully evaluate the quality of generated 3D assets based on various distinct yet complementary criteria. Our key observation is that many desired properties of 3D generation, such as semantic and geometric consistency, can be effectively captured by measuring the consistency among various foundation models and tools. We thus leverage a diverse set of models and tools as probes to evaluate the inconsistency of generated 3D assets across different aspects. Compared to prior work, Eval3D provides pixel-wise measurement, enables accurate 3D spatial feedback, and aligns more closely with human judgments. We comprehensively evaluate existing 3D generation models using Eval3D and highlight the limitations and challenges of current models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning greatly improves the interpretability and problem-solving abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches are focused on text CoT, limiting their ability to leverage visual cues. Visual CoT remains underexplored, and the only work is based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) that relies on extensive labeled bounding-box data and is hard to generalize to unseen cases. In this paper, we introduce Unsupervised Visual CoT (UV-CoT), a novel framework for image-level CoT reasoning via preference optimization. UV-CoT performs preference comparisons between model-generated bounding boxes (one is preferred and the other is dis-preferred), eliminating the need for bounding-box annotations. We get such preference data by introducing an automatic data generation pipeline. Given an image, our target MLLM (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B) generates seed bounding boxes using a template prompt and then answers the question using each bounded region as input. An evaluator MLLM (e.g., OmniLLM-12B) ranks the responses, and these rankings serve as supervision to train the target MLLM with UV-CoT by minimizing negative log-likelihood losses. By emulating human perception--identifying key regions and reasoning based on them--UV-CoT can improve visual comprehension, particularly in spatial reasoning tasks where textual descriptions alone fall short. Our experiments on six datasets demonstrate the superiority of UV-CoT, compared to the state-of-the-art textual and visual CoT methods. Our zero-shot testing on four unseen datasets shows the strong generalization of UV-CoT. The code is available inthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-grained understanding of human actions and poses in videos is essential for human-centric AI applications. In this work, we introduce ActionArt, a fine-grained video-caption dataset designed to advance research in human-centric multimodal understanding. Our dataset comprises thousands of videos capturing a broad spectrum of human actions, human-object interactions, and diverse scenarios, each accompanied by detailed annotations that meticulously label every limb movement. We develop eight sub-tasks to evaluate the fine-grained understanding capabilities of existing large multimodal models across different dimensions. Experimental results indicate that, while current large multimodal models perform commendably on various tasks, they often fall short in achieving fine-grained understanding. We attribute this limitation to the scarcity of meticulously annotated data, which is both costly and difficult to scale manually. Since manual annotations are costly and hard to scale, we propose proxy tasks to enhance the model perception ability in both spatial and temporal dimensions. These proxy tasks are carefully crafted to be driven by data automatically generated from existing MLLMs, thereby reducing the reliance on costly manual labels. Experimental results show that the proposed proxy tasks significantly narrow the gap toward the performance achieved with manually annotated fine-grained data.

- **[Manipulating Multimodal Agents via Cross-Modal Prompt Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14348)**  `arXiv:2504.14348`  `cs.CV`  
  _Le Wang, Zonghao Ying, Tianyuan Zhang, Siyuan Liang, Shengshan Hu, Mingchuan Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of multimodal large language models has redefined the agent paradigm by integrating language and vision modalities with external data sources, enabling agents to better interpret human instructions and execute increasingly complex tasks. However, in this work, we identify a critical yet previously overlooked security vulnerability in multimodal agents: cross-modal prompt injection attacks. To exploit this vulnerability, we propose CrossInject, a novel attack framework in which attackers embed adversarial perturbations across multiple modalities to align with target malicious content, allowing external instructions to hijack the agent's decision-making process and execute unauthorized tasks. Our approach consists of two key components. First, we introduce Visual Latent Alignment, where we optimize adversarial features to the malicious instructions in the visual embedding space based on a text-to-image generative model, ensuring that adversarial images subtly encode cues for malicious task execution. Subsequently, we present Textual Guidance Enhancement, where a large language model is leveraged to infer the black-box defensive system prompt through adversarial meta prompting and generate an malicious textual command that steers the agent's output toward better compliance with attackers' requests. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing injection attacks, achieving at least a +26.4% increase in attack success rates across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we validate our attack's effectiveness in real-world multimodal autonomous agents, highlighting its potential implications for safety-critical applications.

- **[StoryGPT-V: Large Language Models as Consistent Story Visualizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02252)**  `arXiv:2312.02252`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xiaoqian Shen, Mohamed Elhoseiny_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent generative models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating realistic and visually pleasing images grounded on textual prompts. Nevertheless, a significant challenge remains in applying these models for the more intricate task of story visualization. Since it requires resolving pronouns (he, she, they) in the frame descriptions, i.e., anaphora resolution, and ensuring consistent characters and background synthesis across frames. Yet, the emerging Large Language Model (LLM) showcases robust reasoning abilities to navigate through ambiguous references and process extensive sequences. Therefore, we introduce \emph{StoryGPT-V}, which leverages the merits of the latent diffusion (LDM) and LLM to produce images with consistent and high-quality characters grounded on given story descriptions. First, we train a character-aware LDM, which takes character-augmented semantic embedding as input and includes the supervision of the cross-attention map using character segmentation masks, aiming to enhance character generation accuracy and faithfulness. In the second stage, we enable an alignment between the output of LLM and the character-augmented embedding residing in the input space of the first-stage model. This harnesses the reasoning ability of LLM to address ambiguous references and the comprehension capability to memorize the context. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two visual story visualization benchmarks. Our model reports superior quantitative results and consistently generates accurate characters of remarkable quality with low memory consumption. Our code is publicly available at: \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

- **[TRACE Back from the Future: A Probabilistic Reasoning Approach to Controllable Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18535)**  `arXiv:2504.18535`  `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Gwen Yidou Weng, Benjie Wang, Guy Van den Broeck_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LMs) advance, there is an increasing need to control their outputs to align with human values (e.g., detoxification) or desired attributes (e.g., personalization, topic). However, autoregressive models focus on next-token predictions and struggle with global properties that require looking ahead. Existing solutions either tune or post-train LMs for each new attribute - expensive and inflexible - or approximate the Expected Attribute Probability (EAP) of future sequences by sampling or training, which is slow and unreliable for rare attributes. We introduce TRACE (Tractable Probabilistic Reasoning for Adaptable Controllable gEneration), a novel framework that efficiently computes EAP and adapts to new attributes through tractable probabilistic reasoning and lightweight control. TRACE distills a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from an LM and pairs it with a small classifier to estimate attribute probabilities, enabling exact EAP computation over the HMM's predicted futures. This EAP is then used to reweigh the LM's next-token probabilities for globally compliant continuations. Empirically, TRACE achieves state-of-the-art results in detoxification with only 10% decoding overhead, adapts to 76 low-resource personalized LLMs within seconds, and seamlessly extends to composite attributes.

- **[BitNet v2: Native 4-bit Activations with Hadamard Transformation for 1-bit LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18415)**  `arXiv:2504.18415`  `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Hongyu Wang, Shuming Ma, Furu Wei_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient deployment of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs) is hindered by activation outliers, which complicate quantization to low bit-widths. We introduce BitNet v2, a novel framework enabling native 4-bit activation quantization for 1-bit LLMs. To tackle outliers in attention and feed-forward network activations, we propose H-BitLinear, a module applying an online Hadamard transformation prior to activation quantization. This transformation smooths sharp activation distributions into more Gaussian-like forms, suitable for low-bit representation. Experiments show BitNet v2 trained from scratch with 8-bit activations matches BitNet b1.58 performance. Crucially, BitNet v2 achieves minimal performance degradation when trained with native 4-bit activations, significantly reducing memory footprint and computational cost for batched inference.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce BitNet b1.58 2B4T, the first open-source, native 1-bit Large Language Model (LLM) at the 2-billion parameter scale. Trained on a corpus of 4 trillion tokens, the model has been rigorously evaluated across benchmarks covering language understanding, mathematical reasoning, coding proficiency, and conversational ability. Our results demonstrate that BitNet b1.58 2B4T achieves performance on par with leading open-weight, full-precision LLMs of similar size, while offering significant advantages in computational efficiency, including substantially reduced memory footprint, energy consumption, and decoding latency. To facilitate further research and adoption, the model weights are released via Hugging Face along with open-source inference implementations for both GPU and CPU architectures.

  _George Drayson, Emine Yilmaz, Vasileios Lampos_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their generated outputs are proliferating across the web, risking a future where machine-generated content dilutes human-authored text. Since online data is the primary resource for LLM pre-training, subsequent models could be trained on an unknown portion of synthetic samples. This will lead to model collapse, a degenerative process whereby LLMs reinforce their own errors, and ultimately yield a declining performance. In this study, we investigate the impact of decoding strategy on model collapse, analysing the characteristics of text at each model generation, the similarity to human references, and the resulting model performance. Using the decoding strategies that lead to the most significant degradation, we evaluate model collapse in more realistic scenarios where the origin of the data (human or synthetic) is unknown. We train a machine-generated text detector and propose an importance sampling approach to alleviate model collapse. Our method is validated on two LLM variants (GPT-2 and SmolLM2) on the open-ended text generation task.

  Generating images from prompts containing specific entities requires models to retain as much entity-specific knowledge as possible. However, fully memorizing such knowledge is impractical due to the vast number of entities and their continuous emergence. To address this, we propose Text-based Intelligent Generation with Entity prompt Refinement (TextTIGER), which augments knowledge on entities included in the prompts and then summarizes the augmented descriptions using Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate performance degradation from longer inputs. To evaluate our method, we introduce WiT-Cub (WiT with Captions and Uncomplicated Background-explanations), a dataset comprising captions, images, and an entity list. Experiments on four image generation models and five LLMs show that TextTIGER improves image generation performance in standard metrics (IS, FID, and CLIPScore) compared to caption-only prompts. Additionally, multiple annotators' evaluation confirms that the summarized descriptions are more informative, validating LLMs' ability to generate concise yet rich descriptions. These findings demonstrate that refining prompts with augmented and summarized entity-related descriptions enhances image generation capabilities. The code and dataset will be available upon acceptance.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) pose unique safety challenges due to their integration of visual and textual data, thereby introducing new dimensions of potential attacks and complex risk combinations. In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis aimed at disentangling risks through step-by-step reasoning within multimodal inputs. We find that systematic multimodal risk disentanglement substantially enhances the risk awareness of MLLMs. Via leveraging the strong discriminative abilities of multimodal risk disentanglement, we further introduce \textbf{DREAM} (\textit{\textbf{D}isentangling \textbf{R}isks to \textbf{E}nhance Safety \textbf{A}lignment in \textbf{M}LLMs}), a novel approach that enhances safety alignment in MLLMs through supervised fine-tuning and iterative Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF). Experimental results show that DREAM significantly boosts safety during both inference and training phases without compromising performance on normal tasks (namely oversafety), achieving a 16.17\% improvement in the SIUO safe\&effective score compared to GPT-4V.

  Training Large Language Models ( LLMs) to generate explicit reasoning before they produce an answer has been shown to improve their performance across various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, fine-tuning LLMs on multi-turn reasoning datasets presents a unique challenge: LLMs must generate reasoning tokens that are excluded from subsequent inputs to the LLM. This discrepancy prevents us from processing an entire conversation in a single forward pass-an optimization readily available when we fine-tune on a multi-turn non-reasoning dataset. This paper proposes a novel approach that overcomes this limitation through response token duplication and a custom attention mask that enforces appropriate visibility constraints. Our approach significantly reduces the training time and allows efficient fine-tuning on multi-turn reasoning datasets.

  Hallucinations pose a significant obstacle to the reliability and widespread adoption of language models, yet their accurate measurement remains a persistent challenge. While many task- and domain-specific metrics have been proposed to assess faithfulness and factuality concerns, the robustness and generalization of these metrics are still untested. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of 6 diverse sets of hallucination detection metrics across 4 datasets, 37 language models from 5 families, and 5 decoding methods. Our extensive investigation reveals concerning gaps in current hallucination evaluation: metrics often fail to align with human judgments, take an overtly myopic view of the problem, and show inconsistent gains with parameter scaling. Encouragingly, LLM-based evaluation, particularly with GPT-4, yields the best overall results, and mode-seeking decoding methods seem to reduce hallucinations, especially in knowledge-grounded settings. These findings underscore the need for more robust metrics to understand and quantify hallucinations, and better strategies to mitigate them.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce very high-quality tests and responses to our queries. But how much can we trust this generated text? In this paper, we study the problem of uncertainty quantification in LLMs. We propose a novel Random-Set Large Language Model (RSLLM) approach which predicts finite random sets (belief functions) over the token space, rather than probability vectors as in classical LLMs. In order to allow so efficiently, we also present a methodology based on hierarchical clustering to extract and use a budget of "focal" subsets of tokens upon which the belief prediction is defined, rather than using all possible collections of tokens, making the method scalable yet effective. RS-LLMs encode the epistemic uncertainty induced in their generation process by the size and diversity of its training set via the size of the credal sets associated with the predicted belief functions. The proposed approach is evaluated on CoQA and OBQA datasets using Llama2-7b, Mistral-7b and Phi-2 models and is shown to outperform the standard model in both datasets in terms of correctness of answer while also showing potential in estimating the second level uncertainty in its predictions and providing the capability to detect when its hallucinating.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in medicine, yet clinical adoption is hindered by concerns over factual accuracy, language-specific limitations (e.g., Japanese), and critically, their reliability when required to generate reasoning explanations -- a prerequisite for trust. This paper introduces Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B, a 72B-parameter model optimized for the Japanese medical domain to achieve both high accuracy and stable reasoning. We employ a two-stage fine-tuning process on the Qwen2.5-72B base model: first, Continued Pretraining (CPT) on a comprehensive Japanese medical corpus instills deep domain knowledge. Second, Reasoning Preference Optimization (RPO), a preference-based method, enhances the generation of reliable reasoning pathways while preserving high answer accuracy. Evaluations on the Japanese Medical Licensing Exam benchmark (IgakuQA) show Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B achieves state-of-the-art performance (0.868 accuracy), surpassing strong proprietary models like GPT-4o (0.866). Crucially, unlike baseline or CPT-only models which exhibit significant accuracy degradation (up to 11.5\% and 3.8\% respectively on IgakuQA) when prompted for explanations, our model maintains its high accuracy (0.868) under such conditions. This highlights RPO's effectiveness in stabilizing reasoning generation. This work underscores the importance of optimizing for reliable explanations alongside accuracy. We release the Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B model weights to foster research into trustworthy LLMs for specialized, high-stakes applications.

  Synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer a valuable opportunity to create privacy preserving and harmonized structured data, supporting numerous applications in healthcare. Key benefits of synthetic data include precise control over the data schema, improved fairness and representation of patient populations, and the ability to share datasets without concerns about compromising real individuals privacy. Consequently, the AI community has increasingly turned to Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data across various domains. However, a significant challenge in healthcare is ensuring that synthetic health records reliably generalize across different hospitals, a long standing issue in the field. In this work, we evaluate the current state of commercial LLMs for generating synthetic data and investigate multiple aspects of the generation process to identify areas where these models excel and where they fall short. Our main finding from this work is that while LLMs can reliably generate synthetic health records for smaller subsets of features, they struggle to preserve realistic distributions and correlations as the dimensionality of the data increases, ultimately limiting their ability to generalize across diverse hospital settings.

  With powerful large language models (LLMs) demonstrating superhuman reasoning capabilities, a critical question arises: Do LLMs genuinely reason, or do they merely recall answers from their extensive, web-scraped training datasets? Publicly released benchmarks inevitably become contaminated once incorporated into subsequent LLM training sets, undermining their reliability as faithful assessments. To address this, we introduce KUMO, a generative evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing reasoning in LLMs. KUMO synergistically combines LLMs with symbolic engines to dynamically produce diverse, multi-turn reasoning tasks that are partially observable and adjustable in difficulty. Through an automated pipeline, KUMO continuously generates novel tasks across open-ended domains, compelling models to demonstrate genuine generalization rather than memorization. We evaluated 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on 5,000 tasks across 100 domains created by KUMO, benchmarking their reasoning abilities against university students. Our findings reveal that many LLMs have outperformed university-level performance on easy reasoning tasks, and reasoning-scaled LLMs reach university-level performance on complex reasoning challenges. Moreover, LLM performance on KUMO tasks correlates strongly with results on newly released real-world reasoning benchmarks, underscoring KUMO's value as a robust, enduring assessment tool for genuine LLM reasoning capabilities.

  Ensuring faithfulness to context in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems is crucial for reliable deployment in real-world applications, as incorrect or unsupported information can erode user trust. Despite advancements on standard benchmarks, faithfulness hallucination-where models generate responses misaligned with the provided context-remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce FaithEval, a novel and comprehensive benchmark tailored to evaluate the faithfulness of LLMs in contextual scenarios across three diverse tasks: unanswerable, inconsistent, and counterfactual contexts. These tasks simulate real-world challenges where retrieval mechanisms may surface incomplete, contradictory, or fabricated information. FaithEval comprises 4.9K high-quality problems in total, validated through a rigorous four-stage context construction and validation framework, employing both LLM-based auto-evaluation and human validation. Our extensive study across a wide range of open-source and proprietary models reveals that even state-of-the-art models often struggle to remain faithful to the given context, and that larger models do not necessarily exhibit improvedthis http URLis available at:this https URL.

  Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but most of them are not data-driven or training-based. In this paper, we are motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt-response samples, then add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We train the language model by the thoughts-augmented data and successfully let the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been transformative across many domains. However, hallucination -- confidently outputting incorrect information -- remains one of the leading challenges for LLMs. This raises the question of how to accurately assess and quantify the uncertainty of LLMs. Extensive literature on traditional models has explored Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to measure uncertainty and employed calibration techniques to address the misalignment between uncertainty and accuracy. While some of these methods have been adapted for LLMs, the literature lacks an in-depth analysis of their effectiveness and does not offer a comprehensive benchmark to enable insightful comparison among existing solutions. In this work, we fill this gap via a systematic survey of representative prior works on UQ and calibration for LLMs and introduce a rigorous benchmark. Using two widely used reliability datasets, we empirically evaluate six related methods, which justify the significant findings of our review. Finally, we provide outlooks for key future directions and outline open challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first dedicated study to review the calibration methods and relevant metrics for LLMs.

  In response to the growing problem of misinformation in the context of globalization and informatization, this paper proposes a classification method for fact-check-worthiness estimation based on prompt tuning. We construct a model for fact-check-worthiness estimation at the methodological level using prompt tuning. By applying designed prompt templates to large language models, we establish in-context learning and leverage prompt tuning technology to improve the accuracy of determining whether claims have fact-check-worthiness, particularly when dealing with limited or unlabeled data. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses or matches multiple baseline methods in the classification task of fact-check-worthiness estimation assessment, including classical pre-trained models such as BERT, as well as recent popular large models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Experiments show that the prompt tuning-based method proposed in this study exhibits certain advantages in evaluation metrics such as F1 score and accuracy, thereby effectively validating its effectiveness and advancement in the task of fact-check-worthiness estimation.

  Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become the standard non-parametric approach for equipping Large Language Models (LLMs) with up-to-date knowledge and mitigating catastrophic forgetting common in continual learning. However, standard RAG, relying on independent passage retrieval, fails to capture the interconnected nature of human memory crucial for complex reasoning (associativity) and contextual understanding (sense-making). While structured RAG methods like HippoRAG utilize knowledge graphs (KGs) built from triples, the inherent context loss limits fidelity. We introduce PropRAG, a framework leveraging contextually rich propositions and a novel beam search algorithm over proposition paths to explicitly discover multi-step reasoning chains. Crucially, PropRAG's online retrieval process operates entirely without invoking generative LLMs, relying instead on efficient graph traversal and pre-computed embeddings. This avoids online LLM inference costs and potential inconsistencies during evidence gathering. LLMs are used effectively offline for high-quality proposition extraction and post-retrieval for answer generation. PropRAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot Recall@5 results on PopQA (55.3%), 2Wiki (93.7%), HotpotQA (97.0%), and MuSiQue (77.3%), alongside top F1 scores (e.g., 52.4% on MuSiQue). By improving evidence retrieval through richer representation and explicit, LLM-free online path finding, PropRAG advances non-parametric continual learning.

  Efforts to ensure the safety of large language models (LLMs) include safety fine-tuning, evaluation, and red teaming. However, despite the widespread use of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, AI safety work focuses on standard LLMs, which means we know little about how RAG use cases change a model's safety profile. We conduct a detailed comparative analysis of RAG and non-RAG frameworks with eleven LLMs. We find that RAG can make models less safe and change their safety profile. We explore the causes of this change and find that even combinations of safe models with safe documents can cause unsafe generations. In addition, we evaluate some existing red teaming methods for RAG settings and show that they are less effective than when used for non-RAG settings. Our work highlights the need for safety research and red-teaming methods specifically tailored for RAG LLMs.

  Clinical document classification is essential for converting unstructured medical texts into standardised ICD-10 diagnoses, yet it faces challenges due to complex medical language, privacy constraints, and limited annotated datasets. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising improvements in accuracy and efficiency for this task. This study evaluates the performance and consistency of eight LLMs; four reasoning (Qwen QWQ, Deepseek Reasoner, GPT o3 Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking) and four non-reasoning (Llama 3.3, GPT 4o Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Deepseek Chat); in classifying clinical discharge summaries using the MIMIC-IV dataset. Using cTAKES to structure clinical narratives, models were assessed across three experimental runs, with majority voting determining final predictions. Results showed that reasoning models outperformed non-reasoning models in accuracy (71% vs 68%) and F1 score (67% vs 60%), with Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking achieving the highest accuracy (75%) and F1 score (76%). However, non-reasoning models demonstrated greater stability (91% vs 84% consistency). Performance varied across ICD-10 codes, with reasoning models excelling in complex cases but struggling with abstract categories. Findings indicate a trade-off between accuracy and consistency, suggesting that a hybrid approach could optimise clinical coding. Future research should explore multi-label classification, domain-specific fine-tuning, and ensemble methods to enhance model reliability in real-world applications.

  Vocabulary expansion (VE) is the de-facto approach to language adaptation of large language models (LLMs) by adding new tokens and continuing pre-training on target data. While this is effective for base models trained on unlabeled data, it poses challenges for chat models trained to follow instructions through labeled conversation data. Directly adapting the latter with VE on target unlabeled data may result in forgetting chat abilities. While ideal, target chat data is often unavailable or costly to create for low-resource languages, and machine-translated alternatives are not always effective. To address this issue, previous work proposed using a base and chat model from the same family. This method first adapts the base LLM with VE on target unlabeled data and then converts it to a chat model by adding a chat vector (CV) derived from the weight difference between the source base and chat models. We propose ElChat, a new language adaptation method for chat LLMs that adapts a chat model directly on target unlabeled data, without a base model. It elicits chat abilities by injecting information from the source chat model. ElChat offers more robust and competitive target language and safety performance while achieving superior English, chat, and instruction-following abilities compared to CV.

  Interpretation is critical for disease diagnosis, but existing models struggle to balance predictive accuracy with human-understandable rationales. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities, their clinical use is limited by high computational costs and restricted multimodal reasoning ability. Small language models (SLMs) are efficient but lack advanced reasoning for integrating multimodal medical data. In addition, both LLMs and SLMs lack of domain knowledge for trustworthy reasoning. Therefore, we propose ClinRaGen, enhancing SLMs by leveraging LLM-derived reasoning ability via rationale distillation and domain knowledge injection for trustworthy multimodal rationale generation. Key innovations include a sequential rationale distillation framework that equips SLMs with LLM-comparable mutlimodal reasoning abilities, and a knowledge-augmented attention mechanism that jointly unifies multimodal representation from time series and textual data in a same encoding space, enabling it naturally interpreted by SLMs while incorporating domain knowledge for reliable rationale generation. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that ClinRaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in disease diagnosis and rationale generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLM-driven reasoning with knowledge augmentation for improved interpretability.

  This report analyzes the potential for large language models (LLMs) to expedite accurate replication and generalization of published research about message effects in marketing. LLM-powered participants (personas) were tested by replicating 133 experimental findings from 14 papers containing 45 recent studies published in the Journal of Marketing. For each study, the measures, stimuli, and sampling specifications were used to generate prompts for LLMs to act as unique personas. The AI personas, 19,447 in total across all of the studies, generated complete datasets and statistical analyses were then compared with the original human study results. The LLM replications successfully reproduced 76% of the original main effects (84 out of 111), demonstrating strong potential for AI-assisted replication. The overall replication rate including interaction effects was 68% (90 out of 133). Furthermore, a test of how human results generalized to different participant samples, media stimuli, and measures showed that replication results can change when tests go beyond the parameters of the original human studies. Implications are discussed for the replication and generalizability crises in social science, the acceleration of theory building in media and marketing psychology, and the practical advantages of rapid message testing for consumer products. Limitations of AI replications are addressed with respect to complex interaction effects, biases in AI models, and establishing benchmarks for AI metrics in marketing research.

  The ability to generate explanations that are understood by explainees is the quintessence of explainable artificial intelligence. Since understanding depends on the explainee's background and needs, recent research has focused on co-constructive explanation dialogues, where the explainer continuously monitors the explainee's understanding and adapts explanations dynamically. We investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage as explainers in co-constructive explanation dialogues. In particular, we present a user study in which explainees interact with LLMs, of which some have been instructed to explain a predefined topic co-constructively. We evaluate the explainees' understanding before and after the dialogue, as well as their perception of the LLMs' co-constructive behavior. Our results indicate that current LLMs show some co-constructive behaviors, such as asking verification questions, that foster the explainees' engagement and can improve understanding of a topic. However, their ability to effectively monitor the current understanding and scaffold the explanations accordingly remains limited.

  In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, Slot Schema Induction (SSI) is essential for automatically identifying key information slots from dialogue data without manual intervention. This paper presents a novel state-of-the-art (SoTA) approach that formulates SSI as a text generation task, where a language model incrementally constructs and refines a slot schema over a stream of dialogue data. To develop this approach, we present a fully automatic LLM-based TOD simulation method that creates data with high-quality state labels for novel task domains. Furthermore, we identify issues in SSI evaluation due to data leakage and poor metric alignment with human judgment. We resolve these by creating new evaluation data using our simulation method with human guidance and correction, as well as designing improved evaluation metrics. These contributions establish a foundation for future SSI research and advance the SoTA in dialogue understanding and system development.

  In this paper, we introduce PolyMath, a multilingual mathematical reasoning benchmark covering 18 languages and 4 easy-to-hard difficulty levels. Our benchmark ensures difficulty comprehensiveness, language diversity, and high-quality translation, making it a highly discriminative multilingual mathematical benchmark in the era of reasoning LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation for advanced LLMs and find that even Deepseek-R1-671B and Qwen-QwQ-32B, achieve only 43.4 and 41.8 benchmark scores, with less than 30% accuracy under the highest level. From a language perspective, our benchmark reveals several key challenges of LLMs in multilingual reasoning: (1) Reasoning performance varies widely across languages for current LLMs; (2) Input-output language consistency is low in reasoning LLMs and may be correlated with performance; (3) The thinking length differs significantly by language for current LLMs. Additionally, we demonstrate that controlling the output language in the instructions has the potential to affect reasoning performance, especially for some low-resource languages, suggesting a promising direction for improving multilingual capabilities in LLMs.

  Should a large language model (LLM) be used as a therapist? In this paper, we investigate the use of LLMs to *replace* mental health providers, a use case promoted in the tech startup and research space. We conduct a mapping review of therapy guides used by major medical institutions to identify crucial aspects of therapeutic relationships, such as the importance of a therapeutic alliance between therapist and client. We then assess the ability of LLMs to reproduce and adhere to these aspects of therapeutic relationships by conducting several experiments investigating the responses of current LLMs, such as `gpt-4o`. Contrary to best practices in the medical community, LLMs 1) express stigma toward those with mental health conditions and 2) respond inappropriately to certain common (and critical) conditions in naturalistic therapy settings -- e.g., LLMs encourage clients' delusional thinking, likely due to their sycophancy. This occurs even with larger and newer LLMs, indicating that current safety practices may not address these gaps. Furthermore, we note foundational and practical barriers to the adoption of LLMs as therapists, such as that a therapeutic alliance requires human characteristics (e.g., identity and stakes). For these reasons, we conclude that LLMs should not replace therapists, and we discuss alternative roles for LLMs in clinical therapy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-resolution image (HRI) understanding aims to process images with a large number of pixels, such as pathological images and agricultural aerial images, both of which can exceed 1 million pixels. Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) can allegedly handle HRIs, however, there is a lack of a comprehensive benchmark for VLMs to evaluate HRI understanding. To address this gap, we introduce HRScene, a novel unified benchmark for HRI understanding with rich scenes. HRScene incorporates 25 real-world datasets and 2 synthetic diagnostic datasets with resolutions ranging from 1,024 $\times$ 1,024 to 35,503 $\times$ 26,627. HRScene is collected and re-annotated by 10 graduate-level annotators, covering 25 scenarios, ranging from microscopic to radiology images, street views, long-range pictures, and telescope images. It includes HRIs of real-world objects, scanned documents, and composite multi-image. The two diagnostic evaluation datasets are synthesized by combining the target image with the gold answer and distracting images in different orders, assessing how well models utilize regions in HRI. We conduct extensive experiments involving 28 VLMs, including Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o. Experiments on HRScene show that current VLMs achieve an average accuracy of around 50% on real-world tasks, revealing significant gaps in HRI understanding. Results on synthetic datasets reveal that VLMs struggle to effectively utilize HRI regions, showing significant Regional Divergence and lost-in-middle, shedding light on future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, multi-agent frameworks powered by large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly. Despite this progress, there is still a notable absence of benchmark datasets specifically tailored to evaluate their performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce Auto-SLURP, a benchmark dataset aimed at evaluating LLM-based multi-agent frameworks in the context of intelligent personal assistants. Auto-SLURP extends the original SLURP dataset -- initially developed for natural language understanding tasks -- by relabeling the data and integrating simulated servers and external services. This enhancement enables a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation pipeline, covering language understanding, task execution, and response generation. Our experiments demonstrate that Auto-SLURP presents a significant challenge for current state-of-the-art frameworks, highlighting that truly reliable and intelligent multi-agent personal assistants remain a work in progress.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automating structured clinical interviews could revolutionize mental healthcare accessibility, yet existing large language models (LLMs) approaches fail to align with psychiatric diagnostic protocols. We present MAGI, the first framework that transforms the gold-standard Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) into automatic computational workflows through coordinated multi-agent collaboration. MAGI dynamically navigates clinical logic via four specialized agents: 1) an interview tree guided navigation agent adhering to the MINI's branching structure, 2) an adaptive question agent blending diagnostic probing, explaining, and empathy, 3) a judgment agent validating whether the response from participants meet the node, and 4) a diagnosis Agent generating Psychometric Chain-of- Thought (PsyCoT) traces that explicitly map symptoms to clinical criteria. Experimental results on 1,002 real-world participants covering depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety and suicide shows that MAGI advances LLM- assisted mental health assessment by combining clinical rigor, conversational adaptability, and explainable reasoning.

  This study analyzes Chinese and English media reports on the Paris Olympics using topic modeling, Large Language Model (LLM) prompt engineering, and corpus phraseology methods to explore similarities and differences in discourse construction and attitudinal meanings. Common topics include the opening ceremony, athlete performance, and sponsorship brands. Chinese media focus on specific sports, sports spirit, doping controversies, and new technologies, while English media focus on female athletes, medal wins, and eligibility controversies. Chinese reports show more frequent prepositional co-occurrences and positive semantic prosody in describing the opening ceremony and sports spirit. English reports exhibit positive semantic prosody when covering female athletes but negative prosody in predicting opening ceremony reactions and discussing women's boxing controversies.

  Language models prompted with a user description or persona can predict a user's preferences and opinions, but existing approaches to building personas -- based solely on a user's demographic attributes and/or prior judgments -- fail to capture the underlying reasoning behind said user judgments. We introduce PB&J (Psychology of Behavior and Judgments), a framework that improves LLM personas by incorporating rationales of why a user might make specific judgments. These rationales are LLM-generated, and aim to reason about a user's behavior on the basis of their experiences, personality traits or beliefs. This is done using psychological scaffolds -- structured frameworks grounded in theories such as the Big 5 Personality Traits and Primal World Beliefs -- that help provide structure to the generated rationales. Experiments on public opinion and movie preference prediction tasks demonstrate that LLM personas augmented with PB&J rationales consistently outperform methods using only a user's demographics and/or judgments. Additionally, LLM personas constructed using scaffolds describing user beliefs perform competitively with those using human-written rationales.

  Hope is a complex and underexplored emotional state that plays a significant role in education, mental health, and social interaction. Unlike basic emotions, hope manifests in nuanced forms ranging from grounded optimism to exaggerated wishfulness or sarcasm, making it difficult for Natural Language Processing systems to detect accurately. This study introduces PolyHope V2, a multilingual, fine-grained hope speech dataset comprising over 30,000 annotated tweets in English and Spanish. This resource distinguishes between four hope subtypes Generalized, Realistic, Unrealistic, and Sarcastic and enhances existing datasets by explicitly labeling sarcastic instances. We benchmark multiple pretrained transformer models and compare them with large language models (LLMs) such as GPT 4 and Llama 3 under zero-shot and few-shot regimes. Our findings show that fine-tuned transformers outperform prompt-based LLMs, especially in distinguishing nuanced hope categories and sarcasm. Through qualitative analysis and confusion matrices, we highlight systematic challenges in separating closely related hope subtypes. The dataset and results provide a robust foundation for future emotion recognition tasks that demand greater semantic and contextual sensitivity across languages.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance on various complex reasoning benchmarks, the academic community still lacks an in-depth understanding of base model training processes and data quality. To address this, we construct a large-scale, difficulty-graded reasoning dataset containing approximately 3.34 million unique queries of varying difficulty levels and about 40 million distilled responses generated by multiple models over several passes. Leveraging pass rate and Coefficient of Variation (CV), we precisely select the most valuable training data to enhance reasoning capability. Notably, we observe a training pattern shift, indicating that reasoning-focused training based on base models requires higher learning rates for effective training. Using this carefully selected data, we significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of the base model, achieving a pass rate of 79.2\% on the AIME2024 mathematical reasoning benchmark. This result surpasses most current distilled models and closely approaches state-of-the-art performance. We provide detailed descriptions of our data processing, difficulty assessment, and training methodology, and have publicly released all datasets and methods to promote rapid progress in open-source long-reasoning LLMs. The dataset is available at:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplifies reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs) by directly optimizing human preferences without an explicit reward model. We find that during DPO training, the reference model plays the role of a data weight adjuster. However, the common practice of initializing the policy and reference models identically in DPO can lead to inefficient data utilization and impose a performance ceiling. Meanwhile, the lack of a reference model in Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) reduces training robustness and necessitates stricter conditions to prevent catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose Pre-DPO, a simple yet effective DPO-based training paradigm that enhances preference optimization performance by leveraging a guiding reference model. This reference model provides foresight into the optimal policy state achievable through the training preference data, serving as a guiding mechanism that adaptively assigns higher weights to samples more suitable for the model and lower weights to those less suitable. Extensive experiments on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard v0.1 benchmarks demonstrate that Pre-DPO consistently improves the performance of both DPO and SimPO, without relying on external models or additional data.

  Recently, building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to enhance the capability of large language models (LLMs) has become a common practice. Especially in the legal domain, previous judicial decisions play a significant role under the doctrine of stare decisis which emphasizes the importance of making decisions based on (retrieved) prior documents. However, the overall performance of RAG system depends on many components: (1) retrieval corpora, (2) retrieval algorithms, (3) rerankers, (4) LLM backbones, and (5) evaluation metrics. Here we propose LRAGE, an open-source tool for holistic evaluation of RAG systems focusing on the legal domain. LRAGE provides GUI and CLI interfaces to facilitate seamless experiments and investigate how changes in the aforementioned five components affect the overall accuracy. We validated LRAGE using multilingual legal benches including Korean (KBL), English (LegalBench), and Chinese (LawBench) by demonstrating how the overall accuracy changes when varying the five components mentioned above.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities in well-defined problems with clear solutions, such as mathematics and coding. However, they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios like business negotiations, which require strategic reasoning-an ability to navigate dynamic environments and align long-term goals amidst uncertainty. Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts. To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (EPO) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior. To improve adaptability and policy transferability, we train the strategic reasoning model via multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) using process rewards and iterative self-play, without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. Experiments across social and physical domains demonstrate EPO's ability of long-term goal alignment through enhanced strategic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on social dialogue and web navigation tasks. Our findings reveal various collaborative reasoning mechanisms emergent in EPO and its effectiveness in generating novel strategies, underscoring its potential for strategic reasoning in real-world applications.

  The burgeoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have underscored the need for alignment to ensure these models act in accordance with human values and intentions. Existing alignment frameworks present constraints either in the form of expensive human effort or high computational costs. This paper explores a promising middle ground, where we employ a weak LLM that is significantly less resource-intensive than top-tier models, yet offers more automation than purely human feedback. We present a systematic study to evaluate and understand weak LLM's ability to generate feedback for alignment. Our empirical findings demonstrate that weak LLMs can provide feedback that rivals or even exceeds that of fully human-annotated data. Our study indicates a minimized impact of model size on feedback efficacy, shedding light on a scalable and sustainable alignment strategy. To deepen our understanding of alignment under weak LLM feedback, we conduct a series of qualitative and quantitative analyses, offering novel insights into the quality discrepancies between human feedback vs. weak LLM feedback.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks, generating significant interest in their application to recommendation systems. However, existing methods have not fully capitalized on the potential of LLMs, often constrained by limited input information or failing to fully utilize their advanced reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce EXP3RT, a novel LLM-based recommender designed to leverage rich preference information contained in user and item reviews. EXP3RT is basically fine-tuned through distillation from a teacher LLM to perform three key tasks in order: EXP3RT first extracts and encapsulates essential subjective preferences from raw reviews, aggregates and summarizes them according to specific criteria to create user and item profiles. It then generates detailed step-by-step reasoning followed by predicted rating, i.e., reasoning-enhanced rating prediction, by considering both subjective and objective information from user/item profiles and item descriptions. This personalized preference reasoning from EXP3RT enhances rating prediction accuracy and also provides faithful and reasonable explanations for recommendation. Extensive experiments show that EXP3RT outperforms existing methods on both rating prediction and candidate item reranking for top-k recommendation, while significantly enhancing the explainability of recommendation systems.

  Large language models (LLMs) often hallucinate and lack the ability to provide attribution for their generations. Semi-parametric LMs, such as kNN-LM, approach these limitations by refining the output of an LM for a given prompt using its nearest neighbor matches in a non-parametric data store. However, these models often exhibit slow inference speeds and produce non-fluent texts. In this paper, we introduce Nearest Neighbor Speculative Decoding (NEST), a novel semi-parametric language modeling approach that is capable of incorporating real-world text spans of arbitrary length into the LM generations and providing attribution to their sources. NEST performs token-level retrieval at each inference step to compute a semi-parametric mixture distribution and identify promising span continuations in a corpus. It then uses an approximate speculative decoding procedure that accepts a prefix of the retrieved span or generates a new token. NEST significantly enhances the generation quality and attribution rate of the base LM across a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks, surpassing the conventional kNN-LM method and performing competitively with in-context retrieval augmentation. In addition, NEST substantially improves the generation speed, achieving a 1.8x speedup in inference time when applied to Llama-2-Chat 70B. Code will be released atthis https URL.

  Radiology report generation is critical for efficiency but current models lack the structured reasoning of experts, hindering clinical trust and explainability by failing to link visual findings to precise anatomical locations. This paper introduces BoxMed-RL, a groundbreaking unified training framework for generating spatially verifiable and explainable radiology reports. Built on a large vision-language model, BoxMed-RL revolutionizes report generation through two integrated phases: (1) In the Pretraining Phase, we refine the model via medical concept learning, using Chain-of-Thought supervision to internalize the radiologist-like workflow, followed by spatially verifiable reinforcement, which applies reinforcement learning to align medical findings with bounding boxes. (2) In the Downstream Adapter Phase, we freeze the pretrained weights and train a downstream adapter to ensure fluent and clinically credible reports. This framework precisely mimics radiologists' workflow, compelling the model to connect high-level medical concepts with definitive anatomical evidence. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that BoxMed-RL achieves an average 7% improvement in both METEOR and ROUGE-L metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods. An average 5% improvement in large language model-based metrics further underscores BoxMed-RL's robustness in generating high-quality radiology reports.

  The utility of synthetic data to enhance pretraining data quality and hence to improve downstream task accuracy has been widely explored in recent large language models (LLMs). Yet, these approaches fall inadequate in complex, multi-hop and mathematical reasoning tasks as the synthetic data typically fails to add complementary knowledge to the existing raw corpus. In this work, we propose a novel large-scale and diverse Math Informed syNthetic Dialogue (MIND) generation method that improves the mathematical reasoning ability of LLMs. Specifically, using MIND, we generate synthetic conversations based on OpenWebMath (OWM), resulting in a new math corpus, MIND-OWM. Our experiments with different conversational settings reveal that incorporating knowledge gaps between dialog participants is essential for generating high-quality math data. We further identify an effective way to format and integrate synthetic and raw data during pretraining to maximize the gain in mathematical reasoning, emphasizing the need to restructure raw data rather than use it as-is. Compared to pretraining just on raw data, a model pretrained on MIND-OWM shows significant boost in mathematical reasoning (GSM8K: +13.42%, MATH: +2.30%), including superior performance in specialized knowledge (MMLU: +4.55%, MMLU-STEM: +4.28%) and general purpose reasoning tasks (GENERAL REASONING: +2.51%).

  Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in social deduction games (SDGs) like Werewolf, where strategic reasoning and social deception are essential. However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.

  Drug discovery remains a formidable challenge: more than 90 percent of candidate molecules fail in clinical evaluation, and development costs often exceed one billion dollars per approved therapy. Disparate data streams, from genomics and transcriptomics to chemical libraries and clinical records, hinder coherent mechanistic insight and slow progress. Meanwhile, large language models excel at reasoning and tool integration but lack the modular specialization and iterative memory required for regulated, hypothesis-driven workflows. We introduce PharmaSwarm, a unified multi-agent framework that orchestrates specialized LLM "agents" to propose, validate, and refine hypotheses for novel drug targets and lead compounds. Each agent accesses dedicated functionality--automated genomic and expression analysis; a curated biomedical knowledge graph; pathway enrichment and network simulation; interpretable binding affinity prediction--while a central Evaluator LLM continuously ranks proposals by biological plausibility, novelty, in silico efficacy, and safety. A shared memory layer captures validated insights and fine-tunes underlying submodels over time, yielding a self-improving system. Deployable on low-code platforms or Kubernetes-based microservices, PharmaSwarm supports literature-driven discovery, omics-guided target identification, and market-informed repurposing. We also describe a rigorous four-tier validation pipeline spanning retrospective benchmarking, independent computational assays, experimental testing, and expert user studies to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and real-world impact. By acting as an AI copilot, PharmaSwarm can accelerate translational research and deliver high-confidence hypotheses more efficiently than traditional pipelines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved new levels of performance and spread in public usage with the rise of deep neural networks (DNNs). Initially inspired by human neurons and their connections, NNs have become the foundation of AI models for many advanced architectures. However, some of the most integral processes in the human brain, particularly neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in addition to the more spread neuroapoptosis have largely been ignored in DNN architecture design. Instead, contemporary AI development predominantly focuses on constructing advanced frameworks, such as large language models, which retain a static structure of neural connections during training and inference. In this light, we explore how neurogenesis, neuroapoptosis, and neuroplasticity can inspire future AI advances. Specifically, we examine analogous activities in artificial NNs, introducing the concepts of ``dropin'' for neurogenesis and revisiting ``dropout'' and structural pruning for neuroapoptosis. We additionally suggest neuroplasticity combining the two for future large NNs in ``life-long learning'' settings following the biological inspiration. We conclude by advocating for greater research efforts in this interdisciplinary domain and identifying promising directions for future exploration.

  Achieving human-level intelligence requires refining the transition from the fast, intuitive System 1 to the slower, more deliberate System 2 reasoning. While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \href{this https URL}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and drive progress in this rapidly evolving field.
