- **[Scaling RL to Long Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07966)**  `arXiv:2507.07966`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).

- **[Martian World Models: Controllable Video Synthesis with Physically Accurate 3D Reconstructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07978)**  `arXiv:2507.07978`  `cs.CV`

  Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data, synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally, camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

- **[A Survey on Long-Video Storytelling Generation: Architectures, Consistency, and Cinematic Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07202)**  `arXiv:2507.07202`  `cs.CV`

  Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16 seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16 seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their architectural designs and performance characteristics.

- **[FluidNexus: 3D Fluid Reconstruction and Prediction from a Single Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04720)**  `arXiv:2503.04720`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yue Gao, Hong-Xing Yu, Bo Zhu, Jiajun Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study reconstructing and predicting 3D fluid appearance and velocity from a single video. Current methods require multi-view videos for fluid reconstruction. We present FluidNexus, a novel framework that bridges video generation and physics simulation to tackle this task. Our key insight is to synthesize multiple novel-view videos as references for reconstruction. FluidNexus consists of two key components: (1) a novel-view video synthesizer that combines frame-wise view synthesis with video diffusion refinement for generating realistic videos, and (2) a physics-integrated particle representation coupling differentiable simulation and rendering to simultaneously facilitate 3D fluid reconstruction and prediction. To evaluate our approach, we collect two new real-world fluid datasets featuring textured backgrounds and object interactions. Our method enables dynamic novel view synthesis, future prediction, and interaction simulation from a single fluid video. Project website:this https URL.

- **[Multi-modal Generative AI: Multi-modal LLMs, Diffusions and the Unification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14993)**  `arXiv:2409.14993`  `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  Multi-modal generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry. Particularly, two dominant families of techniques have emerged: i) Multi-modal large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability for multi-modal understanding; and ii) Diffusion models exhibit remarkable multi-modal powers in terms of multi-modal generation. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of multi-modal generative AI, including multi-modal LLMs, diffusions, and the unification for understanding and generation. To lay a solid foundation for unified models, we first provide a detailed review of both multi-modal LLMs and diffusion models respectively, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to image/video LLMs as well as text-to-image/video generation. Furthermore, we explore the emerging efforts toward unified models for understanding and generation. To achieve the unification of understanding and generation, we investigate key designs including autoregressive-based and diffusion-based modeling, as well as dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We then introduce several strategies for unified models, analyzing their potential advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we summarize the common datasets widely used for multi-modal generative AI pretraining. Last but not least, we present several challenging future research directions which may contribute to the ongoing advancement of multi-modal generative AI.
