- **[Generative Pre-trained Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07344)**  `arXiv:2505.07344`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yuan Zhang, Jiacheng Jiang, Guoqing Ma, Zhiying Lu, Haoyang Huang, Jianlong Yuan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we present GPDiT, a Generative Pre-trained Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer that unifies the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive modeling for long-range video synthesis, within a continuous latent space. Instead of predicting discrete tokens, GPDiT autoregressively predicts future latent frames using a diffusion loss, enabling natural modeling of motion dynamics and semantic consistency across frames. This continuous autoregressive framework not only enhances generation quality but also endows the model with representation capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight causal attention variant and a parameter-free rotation-based time-conditioning mechanism, improving both the training and inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPDiT achieves strong performance in video generation quality, video representation ability, and few-shot learning tasks, highlighting its potential as an effective framework for video modeling in continuous space.

  Fashion video generation aims to synthesize temporally consistent videos from reference images of a designated character. Despite significant progress, existing diffusion-based methods only support a single reference image as input, severely limiting their capability to generate view-consistent fashion videos, especially when there are different patterns on the clothes from different perspectives. Moreover, the widely adopted motion module does not sufficiently model human body movement, leading to sub-optimal spatiotemporal consistency. To address these issues, we propose ProFashion, a fashion video generation framework leveraging multiple reference images to achieve improved view consistency and temporal coherency. To effectively leverage features from multiple reference images while maintaining a reasonable computational cost, we devise a Pose-aware Prototype Aggregator, which selects and aggregates global and fine-grained reference features according to pose information to form frame-wise prototypes, which serve as guidance in the denoising process. To further enhance motion consistency, we introduce a Flow-enhanced Prototype Instantiator, which exploits the human keypoint motion flow to guide an extra spatiotemporal attention process in the denoiser. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ProFashion, we extensively evaluate our method on the MRFashion-7K dataset we collected from the Internet. ProFashion also outperforms previous methods on the UBC Fashion dataset.

  Recent breakthroughs in generative models-particularly diffusion models and rectified flows-have revolutionized visual content creation, yet aligning model outputs with human preferences remains a critical challenge. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods for visual generation face critical limitations: incompatibility with modern Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)-based sampling paradigms, instability in large-scale training, and lack of validation for video generation. This paper introduces DanceGRPO, the first unified framework to adapt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to visual generation paradigms, unleashing one unified RL algorithm across two generative paradigms (diffusion models and rectified flows), three tasks (text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video), four foundation models (Stable Diffusion, HunyuanVideo, FLUX, SkyReel-I2V), and five reward models (image/video aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary reward). To our knowledge, DanceGRPO is the first RL-based unified framework capable of seamless adaptation across diverse generative paradigms, tasks, foundational models, and reward models. DanceGRPO demonstrates consistent and substantial improvements, which outperform baselines by up to 181% on benchmarks such as HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Notably, DanceGRPO not only can stabilize policy optimization for complex video generation, but also enables generative policy to better capture denoising trajectories for Best-of-N inference scaling and learn from sparse binary feedback. Our results establish DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis. The code will be released.

- **[ShotAdapter: Text-to-Multi-Shot Video Generation with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07652)**  `arXiv:2505.07652`  `cs.CV`

  Current diffusion-based text-to-video methods are limited to producing short video clips of a single shot and lack the capability to generate multi-shot videos with discrete transitions where the same character performs distinct activities across the same or different backgrounds. To address this limitation we propose a framework that includes a dataset collection pipeline and architectural extensions to video diffusion models to enable text-to-multi-shot video generation. Our approach enables generation of multi-shot videos as a single video with full attention across all frames of all shots, ensuring character and background consistency, and allows users to control the number, duration, and content of shots through shot-specific conditioning. This is achieved by incorporating a transition token into the text-to-video model to control at which frames a new shot begins and a local attention masking strategy which controls the transition token's effect and allows shot-specific prompting. To obtain training data we propose a novel data collection pipeline to construct a multi-shot video dataset from existing single-shot video datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-video model for a few thousand iterations is enough for the model to subsequently be able to generate multi-shot videos with shot-specific control, outperforming the baselines.

- **[DAPE: Dual-Stage Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Consistent Video Editing with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07057)**  `arXiv:2505.07057`  `cs.CV`

  Video generation based on diffusion models presents a challenging multimodal task, with video editing emerging as a pivotal direction in this field. Recent video editing approaches primarily fall into two categories: training-required and training-free methods. While training-based methods incur high computational costs, training-free alternatives often yield suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose DAPE, a high-quality yet cost-effective two-stage parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework for video editing. In the first stage, we design an efficient norm-tuning method to enhance temporal consistency in generated videos. The second stage introduces a vision-friendly adapter to improve visual quality. Additionally, we identify critical shortcomings in existing benchmarks, including limited category diversity, imbalanced object distribution, and inconsistent frame counts. To mitigate these issues, we curate a large dataset benchmark comprising 232 videos with rich annotations and 6 editing prompts, enabling objective and comprehensive evaluation of advanced methods. Extensive experiments on existing datasets (BalanceCC, LOVEU-TGVE, RAVE) and our proposed benchmark demonstrate that DAPE significantly improves temporal coherence and text-video alignment while outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches.

- **[BridgeIV: Bridging Customized Image and Video Generation through Test-Time Autoregressive Identity Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06985)**  `arXiv:2505.06985`  `cs.CV`

  Both zero-shot and tuning-based customized text-to-image (CT2I) generation have made significant progress for storytelling content creation. In contrast, research on customized text-to-video (CT2V) generation remains relatively limited. Existing zero-shot CT2V methods suffer from poor generalization, while another line of work directly combining tuning-based T2I models with temporal motion modules often leads to the loss of structural and texture information. To bridge this gap, we propose an autoregressive structure and texture propagation module (STPM), which extracts key structural and texture features from the reference subject and injects them autoregressively into each video frame to enhance consistency. Additionally, we introduce a test-time reward optimization (TTRO) method to further refine fine-grained details. Quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness of STPM and TTRO, demonstrating improvements of 7.8 and 13.1 in CLIP-I and DINO consistency metrics over the baseline, respectively.

  Human motion video generation has advanced significantly, while existing methods still struggle with accurately rendering detailed body parts like hands and faces, especially in long sequences and intricate motions. Current approaches also rely on fixed resolution and struggle to maintain visual consistency. To address these limitations, we propose HumanDiT, a pose-guided Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework trained on a large and wild dataset containing 14,000 hours of high-quality video to produce high-fidelity videos with fine-grained body rendering. Specifically, (i) HumanDiT, built on DiT, supports numerous video resolutions and variable sequence lengths, facilitating learning for long-sequence video generation; (ii) we introduce a prefix-latent reference strategy to maintain personalized characteristics across extended sequences. Furthermore, during inference, HumanDiT leverages Keypoint-DiT to generate subsequent pose sequences, facilitating video continuation from static images or existing videos. It also utilizes a Pose Adapter to enable pose transfer with given sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance in generating long-form, pose-accurate videos across diverse scenarios.
