  Visual planning, by offering a sequence of intermediate visual subgoals to a goal-conditioned low-level policy, achieves promising performance on long-horizon manipulation tasks. To obtain the subgoals, existing methods typically resort to video generation models but suffer from model hallucination and computational cost. We present Vis2Plan, an efficient, explainable and white-box visual planning framework powered by symbolic guidance. From raw, unlabeled play data, Vis2Plan harnesses vision foundation models to automatically extract a compact set of task symbols, which allows building a high-level symbolic transition graph for multi-goal, multi-stage planning. At test time, given a desired task goal, our planner conducts planning at the symbolic level and assembles a sequence of physically consistent intermediate sub-goal images grounded by the underlying symbolic representation. Our Vis2Plan outperforms strong diffusion video generation-based visual planners by delivering 53\% higher aggregate success rate in real robot settings while generating visual plans 35$\times$ faster. The results indicate that Vis2Plan is able to generate physically consistent image goals while offering fully inspectable reasoning steps.

- **[Edge-Assisted Collaborative Fine-Tuning for Multi-User Personalized Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04745)**  `arXiv:2508.04745`  `cs.LG`

  Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality content generation, yet their intensive computational requirements for inference pose challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. Cloud-based solutions aid in computation but often fall short in addressing privacy risks, personalization efficiency, and communication costs in multi-user edge-AIGC scenarios. To bridge this gap, we first analyze existing edge-AIGC applications in personalized content synthesis, revealing their limitations in efficiency and scalability. We then propose a novel cluster-aware hierarchical federated aggregation framework. Based on parameter-efficient local fine-tuning via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the framework first clusters clients based on the similarity of their uploaded task requirements, followed by an intra-cluster aggregation for enhanced personalization at the server-side. Subsequently, an inter-cluster knowledge interaction paradigm is implemented to enable hybrid-style content generation across diversethis http URLupon federated learning (FL) collaboration, our framework simultaneously trains personalized models for individual users at the devices and a shared global model enhanced with multiple LoRA adapters on the server,enabling efficient edge inference; meanwhile, all prompts for clustering and inference are encoded prior to transmission, thereby further mitigating the risk of plaintext leakage. Our evaluations demonstrate that the framework achieves accelerated convergence while maintaining practical viability for scalable multi-user personalized AIGC services under edge constraints.

- **[Personalized Safety Alignment for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01151)**  `arXiv:2508.01151`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yu Lei, Jinbin Bai, Qingyu Shi, Aosong Feng, Kaidong Yu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation, but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process, adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code, data, and models are publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[Hi3DEval: Advancing 3D Generation Evaluation with Hierarchical Validity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05609)**  `arXiv:2508.05609`  `cs.CV`

  Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable alternative to manual evaluations.

- **[PoseGen: In-Context LoRA Finetuning for Pose-Controllable Long Human Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05091)**  `arXiv:2508.05091`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models, which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence. Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of unlimited duration.

- **[S$^2$Q-VDiT: Accurate Quantized Video Diffusion Transformer with Salient Data and Sparse Token Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04016)**  `arXiv:2508.04016`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we propose S$^2$Q-VDiT, a post-training quantization framework for V-DMs that leverages Salient data and Sparse token distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs. Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6 quantization, S$^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering $3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration. Code will be available atthis https URL.

- **[RIFLEx: A Free Lunch for Length Extrapolation in Video Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15894)**  `arXiv:2502.15894`  `cs.CV`  
  _Min Zhao, Guande He, Yixiao Chen, Hongzhou Zhu, Chongxuan Li, Jun Zhu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in video generation have enabled models to synthesize high-quality, minute-long videos. However, generating even longer videos with temporal coherence remains a major challenge and existing length extrapolation methods lead to temporal repetition or motion deceleration. In this work, we systematically analyze the role of frequency components in positional embeddings and identify an intrinsic frequency that primarily governs extrapolation behavior. Based on this insight, we propose RIFLEx, a minimal yet effective approach that reduces the intrinsic frequency to suppress repetition while preserving motion consistency, without requiring any additional modifications. RIFLEx offers a true free lunch--achieving high-quality 2x extrapolation on state-of-the-art video diffusion transformers in a completely training-free manner. Moreover, it enhances quality and enables 3x extrapolation by minimal fine-tuning without long videos. Project page and codes:this https URL.

  We present REM, a framework for segmenting a wide range of concepts in video that can be described through natural language. Our method leverages the universal visual-language mapping learned by video diffusion models on Internet-scale data by fine-tuning them on small-scale Referring Object Segmentation datasets. Our key insight is to preserve the entirety of the generative model's architecture by shifting its objective from predicting noise to predicting mask latents. The resulting model can accurately segment rare and unseen objects, despite only being trained on a limited set of categories. Additionally, it can effortlessly generalize to non-object dynamic concepts, such as smoke or raindrops, as demonstrated in our new benchmark for Referring Video Process Segmentation (Ref-VPS). REM performs on par with the state-of-the-art on in-domain datasets, like Ref-DAVIS, while outperforming them by up to 12 IoU points out-of-domain, leveraging the power of generative pre-training. We also show that advancements in video generation directly improve segmentation.
