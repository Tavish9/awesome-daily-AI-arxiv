  Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95) up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

- **[BranchGRPO: Stable and Efficient GRPO with Structured Branching in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06040)**  `arXiv:2509.06040`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  Recent progress in aligning image and video generative models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has improved human preference alignment, but existing variants remain inefficient due to sequential rollouts and large numbers of sampling steps, unreliable credit assignment: sparse terminal rewards are uniformly propagated across timesteps, failing to capture the varying criticality of decisions during denoising. In this paper, we present BranchGRPO, a method that restructures the rollout process into a branching tree, where shared prefixes amortize computation and pruning removes low-value paths and redundant depths. BranchGRPO introduces three contributions: (1) a branching scheme that amortizes rollout cost through shared prefixes while preserving exploration diversity; (2) a reward fusion and depth-wise advantage estimator that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense step-level signals; and (3) pruning strategies that cut gradient computation but leave forward rollouts and exploration unaffected. On HPDv2.1 image alignment, BranchGRPO improves alignment scores by up to \textbf{16\%} over DanceGRPO, while reducing per-iteration training time by nearly \textbf{55\%}. A hybrid variant, BranchGRPO-Mix, further accelerates training to 4.7x faster than DanceGRPO without degrading alignment. On WanX video generation, it further achieves higher Video-Align scores with sharper and temporally consistent frames compared to DanceGRPO. Codes are available at \href{this https URL}{BranchGRPO}.

  In this paper, we focus on enhancing a diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) model during the post-training phase by distilling a highly capable consistency model from a pretrained T2V model. Our proposed method, T2V-Turbo-v2, introduces a significant advancement by integrating various supervision signals, including high-quality training data, reward model feedback, and conditional guidance, into the consistency distillation process. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we highlight the crucial importance of tailoring datasets to specific learning objectives and the effectiveness of learning from diverse reward models for enhancing both the visual quality and text-video alignment. Additionally, we highlight the vast design space of conditional guidance strategies, which centers on designing an effective energy function to augment the teacher ODE solver. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by extracting motion guidance from the training datasets and incorporating it into the ODE solver, showcasing its effectiveness in improving the motion quality of the generated videos with the improved motion-related metrics from VBench and T2V-CompBench. Empirically, our T2V-Turbo-v2 establishes a new state-of-the-art result on VBench, with a Total score of 85.13, surpassing proprietary systems such as Gen-3 and Kling.

  Generating 3D worlds from text is a highly anticipated goal in computer vision. Existing works are limited by the degree of exploration they allow inside of a scene, i.e., produce streched-out and noisy artifacts when moving beyond central or panoramic perspectives. To this end, we propose WorldExplorer, a novel method based on autoregressive video trajectory generation, which builds fully navigable 3D scenes with consistent visual quality across a wide range of viewpoints. We initialize our scenes by creating multi-view consistent images corresponding to a 360 degree panorama. Then, we expand it by leveraging video diffusion models in an iterative scene generation pipeline. Concretely, we generate multiple videos along short, pre-defined trajectories, that explore the scene in depth, including motion around objects. Our novel scene memory conditions each video on the most relevant prior views, while a collision-detection mechanism prevents degenerate results, like moving into objects. Finally, we fuse all generated views into a unified 3D representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization. Compared to prior approaches, WorldExplorer produces high-quality scenes that remain stable under large camera motion, enabling for the first time realistic and unrestricted exploration. We believe this marks a significant step toward generating immersive and truly explorable virtual 3D environments.

- **[Think Before You Diffuse: LLMs-Guided Physics-Aware Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21653)**  `arXiv:2505.21653`  `cs.CV`

  Recent video diffusion models have demonstrated their great capability in generating visually-pleasing results, while synthesizing the correct physical effects in generated videos remains challenging. The complexity of real-world motions, interactions, and dynamics introduce great difficulties when learning physics from data. In this work, we propose DiffPhy, a generic framework that enables physically-correct and photo-realistic video generation by fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion model. Our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to explicitly reason a comprehensive physical context from the text prompt and use it to guide the generation. To incorporate physical context into the diffusion model, we leverage a Multimodal large language model (MLLM) as a supervisory signal and introduce a set of novel training objectives that jointly enforce physical correctness and semantic consistency with the input text. We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPhy is able to produce state-of-the-art results across diverse physics-related scenarios.
