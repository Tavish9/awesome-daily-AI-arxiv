- **[DreamGen: Unlocking Generalization in Robot Learning through Neural Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12705)**  `arXiv:2505.12705`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  We introduce DreamGen, a simple yet highly effective 4-stage pipeline for training robot policies that generalize across behaviors and environments through neural trajectories - synthetic robot data generated from video world models. DreamGen leverages state-of-the-art image-to-video generative models, adapting them to the target robot embodiment to produce photorealistic synthetic videos of familiar or novel tasks in diverse environments. Since these models generate only videos, we recover pseudo-action sequences using either a latent action model or an inverse-dynamics model (IDM). Despite its simplicity, DreamGen unlocks strong behavior and environment generalization: a humanoid robot can perform 22 new behaviors in both seen and unseen environments, while requiring teleoperation data from only a single pick-and-place task in one environment. To evaluate the pipeline systematically, we introduce DreamGen Bench, a video generation benchmark that shows a strong correlation between benchmark performance and downstream policy success. Our work establishes a promising new axis for scaling robot learning well beyond manual data collection.

  Clear, interpretable instructions are invaluable when attempting any complex task. Good instructions help to clarify the task and even anticipate the steps needed to solve it. In this work, we propose a robot learning framework for communicating, planning, and executing a wide range of tasks, dubbed This&That. This&That solves general tasks by leveraging video generative models, which, through training on internet-scale data, contain rich physical and semantic context. In this work, we tackle three fundamental challenges in video-based planning: 1) unambiguous task communication with simple human instructions, 2) controllable video generation that respects user intent, and 3) translating visual plans into robot actions. This&That uses language-gesture conditioning to generate video predictions, as a succinct and unambiguous alternative to existing language-only methods, especially in complex and uncertain environments. These video predictions are then fed into a behavior cloning architecture dubbed Diffusion Video to Action (DiVA), which outperforms prior state-of-the-art behavior cloning and video-based planning methods by substantial margins.

- **[EWMBench: Evaluating Scene, Motion, and Semantic Quality in Embodied World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09694)**  `arXiv:2505.09694`  `cs.RO`

  Recent advances in creative AI have enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images and videos conditioned on language instructions. Building on these developments, text-to-video diffusion models have evolved into embodied world models (EWMs) capable of generating physically plausible scenes from language commands, effectively bridging vision and action in embodied AI applications. This work addresses the critical challenge of evaluating EWMs beyond general perceptual metrics to ensure the generation of physically grounded and action-consistent behaviors. We propose the Embodied World Model Benchmark (EWMBench), a dedicated framework designed to evaluate EWMs based on three key aspects: visual scene consistency, motion correctness, and semantic alignment. Our approach leverages a meticulously curated dataset encompassing diverse scenes and motion patterns, alongside a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation toolkit, to assess and compare candidate models. The proposed benchmark not only identifies the limitations of existing video generation models in meeting the unique requirements of embodied tasks but also provides valuable insights to guide future advancements in the field. The dataset and evaluation tools are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Despite advancements in grounded content generation, production Large Language Models (LLMs) based applications still suffer from hallucinated answers. We present "Grounded in Context" - Deepchecks' hallucination detection framework, designed for production-scale long-context data and tailored to diverse use cases, including summarization, data extraction, and RAG. Inspired by RAG architecture, our method integrates retrieval and Natural Language Inference (NLI) models to predict factual consistency between premises and hypotheses using an encoder-based model with only a 512-token context window. Our framework identifies unsupported claims with an F1 score of 0.83 in RAGTruth's response-level classification task, matching methods that trained on the dataset, and outperforming all comparable frameworks using similar-sized models.

  Current frontier video diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable results at generating high-quality videos. However, they can only generate short video clips, normally around 10 seconds or 240 frames, due to computation limitations during training. Existing methods naively achieve autoregressive long video generation by directly placing the ending of the previous clip at the front of the attention window as conditioning, which leads to abrupt scene changes, unnatural motion, and error accumulation. In this work, we introduce a more natural formulation of autoregressive long video generation by revisiting the noise level assumption in video diffusion models. Our key idea is to 1. assign the frames with per-frame, progressively increasing noise levels rather than a single noise level and 2. denoise and shift the frames in small intervals rather than all at once. This allows for smoother attention correspondence among frames with adjacent noise levels, larger overlaps between the attention windows, and better propagation of information from the earlier to the later frames. Video diffusion models equipped with our progressive noise schedule can autoregressively generate long videos with much improved fidelity compared to the baselines and minimal quality degradation over time. We present the first results on text-conditioned 60-second (1440 frames) long video generation at a quality close to frontier models. Code and video results are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present MAGI-1, a world model that generates videos by autoregressively predicting a sequence of video chunks, defined as fixed-length segments of consecutive frames. Trained to denoise per-chunk noise that increases monotonically over time, MAGI-1 enables causal temporal modeling and naturally supports streaming generation. It achieves strong performance on image-to-video (I2V) tasks conditioned on text instructions, providing high temporal consistency and scalability, which are made possible by several algorithmic innovations and a dedicated infrastructure stack. MAGI-1 facilitates controllable generation via chunk-wise prompting and supports real-time, memory-efficient deployment by maintaining constant peak inference cost, regardless of video length. The largest variant of MAGI-1 comprises 24 billion parameters and supports context lengths of up to 4 million tokens, demonstrating the scalability and robustness of our approach.

- **[Video-GPT via Next Clip Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12489)**  `arXiv:2505.12489`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  GPT has shown its remarkable success in natural language processing. However, the language sequence is not sufficient to describe spatial-temporal details in the visual world. Alternatively, the video sequence is good at capturing such details. Motivated by this fact, we propose a concise Video-GPT in this paper by treating video as new language for visual world modeling. By analogy to next token prediction in GPT, we introduce a novel next clip diffusion paradigm for pretraining Video-GPT. Different from the previous works, this distinct paradigm allows Video-GPT to tackle both short-term generation and long-term prediction, by autoregressively denoising the noisy clip according to the clean clips in the history. Extensive experiments show our Video-GPT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on video prediction, which is the key factor towards world modeling (Physics-IQ Benchmark: Video-GPT 34.97 vs. Kling 23.64 vs. Wan 20.89). Moreover, it can be well adapted on 6 mainstream video tasks in both video generation and understanding, showing its great generalization capacity in downstream. The project page is atthis https URL.

- **[VFRTok: Variable Frame Rates Video Tokenizer with Duration-Proportional Information Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12053)**  `arXiv:2505.12053`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Tianxiong Zhong, Xingye Tian, Boyuan Jiang, Xuebo Wang, Xin Tao, Pengfei Wan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern video generation frameworks based on Latent Diffusion Models suffer from inefficiencies in tokenization due to the Frame-Proportional Information Assumption. Existing tokenizers provide fixed temporal compression rates, causing the computational cost of the diffusion model to scale linearly with the frame rate. The paper proposes the Duration-Proportional Information Assumption: the upper bound on the information capacity of a video is proportional to the duration rather than the number of frames. Based on this insight, the paper introduces VFRTok, a Transformer-based video tokenizer, that enables variable frame rate encoding and decoding through asymmetric frame rate training between the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, the paper proposes Partial Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to decouple position and content modeling, which groups correlated patches into unified tokens. The Partial RoPE effectively improves content-awareness, enhancing the video generation capability. Benefiting from the compact and continuous spatio-temporal representation, VFRTok achieves competitive reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art generation fidelity while using only 1/8 tokens compared to existing tokenizers.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we present GPDiT, a Generative Pre-trained Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer that unifies the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive modeling for long-range video synthesis, within a continuous latent space. Instead of predicting discrete tokens, GPDiT autoregressively predicts future latent frames using a diffusion loss, enabling natural modeling of motion dynamics and semantic consistency across frames. This continuous autoregressive framework not only enhances generation quality but also endows the model with representation capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight causal attention variant and a parameter-free rotation-based time-conditioning mechanism, improving both the training and inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPDiT achieves strong performance in video generation quality, video representation ability, and few-shot learning tasks, highlighting its potential as an effective framework for video modeling in continuous space.

- **[Safe-Sora: Safe Text-to-Video Generation via Graphical Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12667)**  `arXiv:2505.12667`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zihan Su, Xuerui Qiu, Hongbin Xu, Tangyu Jiang, Junhao Zhuang, Chun Yuan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The explosive growth of generative video models has amplified the demand for reliable copyright preservation of AI-generated content. Despite its popularity in image synthesis, invisible generative watermarking remains largely underexplored in video generation. To address this gap, we propose Safe-Sora, the first framework to embed graphical watermarks directly into the video generation process. Motivated by the observation that watermarking performance is closely tied to the visual similarity between the watermark and cover content, we introduce a hierarchical coarse-to-fine adaptive matching mechanism. Specifically, the watermark image is divided into patches, each assigned to the most visually similar video frame, and further localized to the optimal spatial region for seamless embedding. To enable spatiotemporal fusion of watermark patches across video frames, we develop a 3D wavelet transform-enhanced Mamba architecture with a novel spatiotemporal local scanning strategy, effectively modeling long-range dependencies during watermark embedding and retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply state space models to watermarking, opening new avenues for efficient and robust watermark protection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Safe-Sora achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of video quality, watermark fidelity, and robustness, which is largely attributed to our proposals. We will release our code upon publication.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advances in AI generative models facilitate super-realistic video synthesis, amplifying misinformation risks via social media and eroding trust in digital content. Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.

- **[LOVE: Benchmarking and Evaluating Text-to-Video Generation and Video-to-Text Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12098)**  `arXiv:2505.12098`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jiarui Wang, Huiyu Duan, Ziheng Jia, Yu Zhao, Woo Yi Yang, Zicheng Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) have driven substantial progress in both text-to-video (T2V) generation and video-to-text (V2T) interpretation tasks. However, current AI-generated videos (AIGVs) still exhibit limitations in terms of perceptual quality and text-video alignment. Therefore, a reliable and scalable automatic model for AIGV evaluation is desirable, which heavily relies on the scale and quality of human annotations. To this end, we present AIGVE-60K, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for AI-Generated Video Evaluation, which features (i) comprehensive tasks, encompassing 3,050 extensive prompts across 20 fine-grained task dimensions, (ii) the largest human annotations, including 120K mean-opinion scores (MOSs) and 60K question-answering (QA) pairs annotated on 58,500 videos generated from 30 T2V models, and (iii) bidirectional benchmarking and evaluating for both T2V generation and V2T interpretation capabilities. Based on AIGVE-60K, we propose LOVE, a LMM-based metric for AIGV Evaluation from multiple dimensions including perceptual preference, text-video correspondence, and task-specific accuracy in terms of both instance level and model level. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LOVE not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AIGVE-60K dataset, but also generalizes effectively to a wide range of other AIGV evaluation benchmarks. These findings highlight the significance of the AIGVE-60K dataset. Database and codes are anonymously available atthis https URL.

- **[Self-NPO: Negative Preference Optimization of Diffusion Models by Simply Learning from Itself without Explicit Preference Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11777)**  `arXiv:2505.11777`  `cs.CV`  
  _Fu-Yun Wang, Keqiang Sun, Yao Teng, Xihui Liu, Jiaming Song, Hongsheng Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various visual generation tasks, including image, video, and 3D content generation. Preference optimization (PO) is a prominent and growing area of research that aims to align these models with human preferences. While existing PO methods primarily concentrate on producing favorable outputs, they often overlook the significance of classifier-free guidance (CFG) in mitigating undesirable results. Diffusion-NPO addresses this gap by introducing negative preference optimization (NPO), training models to generate outputs opposite to human preferences and thereby steering them away from unfavorable outcomes. However, prior NPO approaches, including Diffusion-NPO, rely on costly and fragile procedures for obtaining explicit preference annotations (e.g., manual pairwise labeling or reward model training), limiting their practicality in domains where such data are scarce or difficult to acquire. In this work, we introduce Self-NPO, a Negative Preference Optimization approach that learns exclusively from the model itself, thereby eliminating the need for manual data labeling or reward model training. Moreover, our method is highly efficient and does not require exhaustive data sampling. We demonstrate that Self-NPO integrates seamlessly into widely used diffusion models, including SD1.5, SDXL, and CogVideoX, as well as models already optimized for human preferences, consistently enhancing both their generation quality and alignment with human preferences.

- **[DiTPainter: Efficient Video Inpainting with Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15661)**  `arXiv:2504.15661`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xian Wu, Chang Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many existing video inpainting algorithms utilize optical flows to construct the corresponding maps and then propagate pixels from adjacent frames to missing areas by mapping. Despite the effectiveness of the propagation mechanism, they might encounter blurry and inconsistencies when dealing with inaccurate optical flows or large masks. Recently, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as a revolutionary technique for video generation tasks. However, pretrained DiT models for video generation all contain a large amount of parameters, which makes it very time consuming to apply to video inpainting tasks. In this paper, we present DiTPainter, an end-to-end video inpainting model based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT). DiTPainter uses an efficient transformer network designed for video inpainting, which is trained from scratch instead of initializing from any large pretrained models. DiTPainter can address videos with arbitrary lengths and can be applied to video decaptioning and video completion tasks with an acceptable time cost. Experiments show that DiTPainter outperforms existing video inpainting algorithms with higher quality and better spatial-temporal consistency.

- **[DynamiCtrl: Rethinking the Basic Structure and the Role of Text for High-quality Human Image Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21246)**  `arXiv:2503.21246`  `cs.CV`  
  _Haoyu Zhao, Zhongang Qi, Cong Wang, Qingping Zheng, Guansong Lu, Fei Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With diffusion transformer (DiT) excelling in video generation, its use in specific tasks has drawn increasing attention. However, adapting DiT for pose-guided human image animation faces two core challenges: (a) existing U-Net-based pose control methods may be suboptimal for the DiT backbone; and (b) removing text guidance, as in previous approaches, often leads to semantic loss and model degradation. To address these issues, we propose DynamiCtrl, a novel framework for human animation in video DiT architecture. Specifically, we use a shared VAE encoder for human images and driving poses, unifying them into a common latent space, maintaining pose fidelity, and eliminating the need for an expert pose encoder during video denoising. To integrate pose control into the DiT backbone effectively, we propose a novel Pose-adaptive Layer Norm model. It injects normalized pose features into the denoising process via conditioning on visual tokens, enabling seamless and scalable pose control across DiT blocks. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of text removal, we introduce the "Joint-text" paradigm, which preserves the role of text embeddings to provide global semantic context. Through full-attention blocks, image and pose features are aligned with text features, enhancing semantic consistency, leveraging pretrained knowledge, and enabling multi-level control. Experiments verify the superiority of DynamiCtrl on benchmark and self-collected data (e.g., achieving the best LPIPS of 0.166), demonstrating strong character control and high-quality synthesis.

- **[Long-Context Autoregressive Video Modeling with Next-Frame Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19325)**  `arXiv:2503.19325`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yuchao Gu, Weijia Mao, Mike Zheng Shou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-context video modeling is essential for enabling generative models to function as world simulators, as they must maintain temporal coherence over extended time spans. However, most existing models are trained on short clips, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies, even with test-time extrapolation. While training directly on long videos is a natural solution, the rapid growth of vision tokens makes it computationally prohibitive. To support exploring efficient long-context video modeling, we first establish a strong autoregressive baseline called Frame AutoRegressive (FAR). FAR models temporal dependencies between continuous frames, converges faster than video diffusion transformers, and outperforms token-level autoregressive models. Based on this baseline, we observe context redundancy in video autoregression. Nearby frames are critical for maintaining temporal consistency, whereas distant frames primarily serve as context memory. To eliminate this redundancy, we propose the long short-term context modeling using asymmetric patchify kernels, which apply large kernels to distant frames to reduce redundant tokens, and standard kernels to local frames to preserve fine-grained detail. This significantly reduces the training cost of long videos. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on both short and long video generation, providing an effective baseline for long-context autoregressive video modeling.

- **[OR-Bench: An Over-Refusal Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20947)**  `arXiv:2405.20947`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Justin Cui, Wei-Lin Chiang, Ion Stoica, Cho-Jui Hsieh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) require careful safety alignment to prevent malicious outputs. While significant research focuses on mitigating harmful content generation, the enhanced safety often come with the side effect of over-refusal, where LLMs may reject innocuous prompts and become less helpful. Although the issue of over-refusal has been empirically observed, a systematic measurement is challenging due to the difficulty of crafting prompts that can elicit the over-refusal behaviors of LLMs. This study proposes a novel method for automatically generating large-scale over-refusal datasets. Leveraging this technique, we introduce OR-Bench, the first large-scale over-refusal benchmark. OR-Bench comprises 80,000 over-refusal prompts across 10 common rejection categories, a subset of around 1,000 hard prompts that are challenging even for state-of-the-art LLMs, and an additional 600 toxic prompts to prevent indiscriminate responses. We then conduct a comprehensive study to measure the over-refusal of 32 popular LLMs across 8 model families. Our datasets are publicly available atthis https URLand our codebase is open-sourced atthis https URL. We hope this benchmark can help the community develop better safety aligned models.

- **[VidCapBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Video Captioning for Controllable Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12782)**  `arXiv:2502.12782`  `cs.AI`  
  _Xinlong Chen, Yuanxing Zhang, Chongling Rao, Yushuo Guan, Jiaheng Liu, Fuzheng Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The training of controllable text-to-video (T2V) models relies heavily on the alignment between videos and captions, yet little existing research connects video caption evaluation with T2V generation assessment. This paper introduces VidCapBench, a video caption evaluation scheme specifically designed for T2V generation, agnostic to any particular caption format. VidCapBench employs a data annotation pipeline, combining expert model labeling and human refinement, to associate each collected video with key information spanning video aesthetics, content, motion, and physical laws. VidCapBench then partitions these key information attributes into automatically assessable and manually assessable subsets, catering to both the rapid evaluation needs of agile development and the accuracy requirements of thorough validation. By evaluating numerous state-of-the-art captioning models, we demonstrate the superior stability and comprehensiveness of VidCapBench compared to existing video captioning evaluation approaches. Verification with off-the-shelf T2V models reveals a significant positive correlation between scores on VidCapBench and the T2V quality evaluation metrics, indicating that VidCapBench can provide valuable guidance for training T2V models.
