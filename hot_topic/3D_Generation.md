  Synthetic video generation has gained significant attention for its realism and broad applications, but remains prone to violations of common sense and physical laws. This highlights the need for reliable abnormality detectors that understand such principles and are robust to hallucinations. To address this, we introduce VideoHallu, a benchmark of over 3,000 video QA pairs built from synthetic videos generated by models like Veo2, Sora, and Kling, paired with expert-crafted counterintuitive QA to evaluate the critical thinking abilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on abnormalities that are perceptually obvious to humans but often hallucinated due to language priors. VideoHallu evaluates MLLMs' abnormality detection abilities with examples across alignment, consistency, commonsense, and physics. We benchmark SOTA MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, Video-R1, and VideoChat-R1. We observe that these models perform well on many real-world benchmarks like MVBench and MovieChat, but still struggle with basic physics-based and commonsense reasoning in synthetic videos. We further show that post-training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), using curriculum learning on datasets combining video QA with counterintuitive commonsense and physics reasoning over real and synthetic videos, improves MLLMs' abnormality detection and critical thinking, demonstrating the value of targeted training for improving their understanding of commonsense and physical laws.

  This report introduces Aquarius, a family of industry-level video generation models for marketing scenarios designed for thousands-xPU clusters and models with hundreds of billions of parameters. Leveraging efficient engineering architecture and algorithmic innovation, Aquarius demonstrates exceptional performance in high-fidelity, multi-aspect-ratio, and long-duration video synthesis. By disclosing the framework's design details, we aim to demystify industrial-scale video generation systems and catalyze advancements in the generative video community. The Aquarius framework consists of five components: Distributed Graph and Video Data Processing Pipeline: Manages tens of thousands of CPUs and thousands of xPUs via automated task distribution, enabling efficient video data processing. Additionally, we are about to open-source the entire data processing framework named "Aquarius-Datapipe". Model Architectures for Different Scales: Include a Single-DiT architecture for 2B models and a Multimodal-DiT architecture for 13.4B models, supporting multi-aspect ratios, multi-resolution, and multi-duration video generation. High-Performance infrastructure designed for video generation model training: Incorporating hybrid parallelism and fine-grained memory optimization strategies, this infrastructure achieves 36% MFU at large scale. Multi-xPU Parallel Inference Acceleration: Utilizes diffusion cache and attention optimization to achieve a 2.35x inference speedup. Multiple marketing-scenarios applications: Including image-to-video, text-to-video (avatar), video inpainting and video personalization, among others. More downstream applications and multi-dimensional evaluation metrics will be added in the upcoming version updates.
