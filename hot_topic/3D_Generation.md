- **[Quant VideoGen: Auto-Regressive Long Video Generation via 2-Bit KV-Cache Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02958)**  `arXiv:2602.02958`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite rapid progress in autoregressive video diffusion, an emerging system algorithm bottleneck limits both deployability and generation capability: KV cache memory. In autoregressive video generation models, the KV cache grows with generation history and quickly dominates GPU memory, often exceeding 30 GB, preventing deployment on widely available hardware. More critically, constrained KV cache budgets restrict the effective working memory, directly degrading long horizon consistency in identity, layout, and motion. To address this challenge, we present Quant VideoGen (QVG), a training free KV cache quantization framework for autoregressive video diffusion models. QVG leverages video spatiotemporal redundancy through Semantic Aware Smoothing, producing low magnitude, quantization friendly residuals. It further introduces Progressive Residual Quantization, a coarse to fine multi stage scheme that reduces quantization error while enabling a smooth quality memory trade off. Across LongCat Video, HY WorldPlay, and Self Forcing benchmarks, QVG establishes a new Pareto frontier between quality and memory efficiency, reducing KV cache memory by up to 7.0 times with less than 4% end to end latency overhead while consistently outperforming existing baselines in generation quality.

- **[Mode Seeking meets Mean Seeking for Fast Long Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24289)**  `arXiv:2602.24289`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  Scaling video generation from seconds to minutes faces a critical bottleneck: while short-video data is abundant and high-fidelity, coherent long-form data is scarce and limited to narrow domains. To address this, we propose a training paradigm where Mode Seeking meets Mean Seeking, decoupling local fidelity from long-term coherence based on a unified representation via a Decoupled Diffusion Transformer. Our approach utilizes a global Flow Matching head trained via supervised learning on long videos to capture narrative structure, while simultaneously employing a local Distribution Matching head that aligns sliding windows to a frozen short-video teacher via a mode-seeking reverse-KL divergence. This strategy enables the synthesis of minute-scale videos that learns long-range coherence and motions from limited long videos via supervised flow matching, while inheriting local realism by aligning every sliding-window segment of the student to a frozen short-video teacher, resulting in a few-step fast long video generator. Evaluations show that our method effectively closes the fidelity-horizon gap by jointly improving local sharpness, motion and long-range consistency. Project website:this https URL.

- **[SenCache: Accelerating Diffusion Model Inference via Sensitivity-Aware Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24208)**  `arXiv:2602.24208`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Yasaman Haghighi, Alexandre Alahi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art video generation quality, but their inference remains expensive due to the large number of sequential denoising steps. This has motivated a growing line of research on accelerating diffusion inference. Among training-free acceleration methods, caching reduces computation by reusing previously computed model outputs across timesteps. Existing caching methods rely on heuristic criteria to choose cache/reuse timesteps and require extensive tuning. We address this limitation with a principled sensitivity-aware caching framework. Specifically, we formalize the caching error through an analysis of the model output sensitivity to perturbations in the denoising inputs, i.e., the noisy latent and the timestep, and show that this sensitivity is a key predictor of caching error. Based on this analysis, we propose Sensitivity-Aware Caching (SenCache), a dynamic caching policy that adaptively selects caching timesteps on a per-sample basis. Our framework provides a theoretical basis for adaptive caching, explains why prior empirical heuristics can be partially effective, and extends them to a dynamic, sample-specific approach. Experiments on Wan 2.1, CogVideoX, and LTX-Video show that SenCache achieves better visual quality than existing caching methods under similar computational budgets.

- **[SceneTok: A Compressed, Diffusable Token Space for 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18882)**  `arXiv:2602.18882`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Mohammad Asim, Christopher Wewer, Jan Eric Lenssen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present SceneTok, a novel tokenizer for encoding view sets of scenes into a compressed and diffusable set of unstructured tokens. Existing approaches for 3D scene representation and generation commonly use 3D data structures or view-aligned fields. In contrast, we introduce the first method that encodes scene information into a small set of permutation-invariant tokens that is disentangled from the spatial grid. The scene tokens are predicted by a multi-view tokenizer given many context views and rendered into novel views by employing a light-weight rectified flow decoder. We show that the compression is 1-3 orders of magnitude stronger than for other representations while still reaching state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Further, our representation can be rendered from novel trajectories, including ones deviating from the input trajectory, and we show that the decoder gracefully handles uncertainty. Finally, the highly-compressed set of unstructured latent scene tokens enables simple and efficient scene generation in 5 seconds, achieving a much better quality-speed trade-off than previous paradigms.

- **[SwitchCraft: Training-Free Multi-Event Video Generation with Attention Controls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23956)**  `arXiv:2602.23956`  `cs.CV`  
  _Qianxun Xu, Chenxi Song, Yujun Cai, Chi Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity and temporally coherent videos synthesis. However, current models are predominantly optimized for single-event generation. When handling multi-event prompts, without explicit temporal grounding, such models often produce blended or collapsed scenes that break the intended narrative. To address this limitation, we present SwitchCraft, a training-free framework for multi-event video generation. Our key insight is that uniform prompt injection across time ignores the correspondence between events and frames. To this end, we introduce Event-Aligned Query Steering (EAQS), which steers frame-level attention to align with relevant event prompts. Furthermore, we propose Auto-Balance Strength Solver (ABSS), which adaptively balances steering strength to preserve temporal consistency and visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SwitchCraft substantially improves prompt alignment, event clarity, and scene consistency compared with existing baselines, offering a simple yet effective solution for multi-event video generation.

- **[SPATIALALIGN: Aligning Dynamic Spatial Relationships in Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22745)**  `arXiv:2602.22745`  `cs.CV`  
  _Fengming Liu, Tat-Jen Cham, Chuanxia Zheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most text-to-video (T2V) generators prioritize aesthetic quality, but often ignoring the spatial constraints in the generated videos. In this work, we present SPATIALALIGN, a self-improvement framework that enhances T2V models capabilities to depict Dynamic Spatial Relationships (DSR) specified in text prompts. We present a zeroth-order regularized Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune T2V models towards better alignment with DSR. Specifically, we design DSR-SCORE, a geometry-based metric that quantitatively measures the alignment between generated videos and the specified DSRs in prompts, which is a step forward from prior works that rely on VLM for evaluation. We also conduct a dataset of text-video pairs with diverse DSRs to facilitate the study. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned model significantly out performs the baseline in spatial relationships. The code will be released in Link. Project page:this https URL

- **[Inference-time Physics Alignment of Video Generative Models with Latent World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10553)**  `arXiv:2601.10553`  `cs.CV`

  State-of-the-art video generative models produce promising visual content yet often violate basic physics principles, limiting their utility. While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance. Empirically, our approach substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, with validation from human preference study. Notably, in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, we achieve a final score of 62.64%, winning first place and outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%. Our work demonstrates the viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, beyond this specific instantiation or parameterization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of video generation models has made it increasingly challenging to distinguish AI-generated videos from real ones. This issue underscores the urgent need for effective AI-generated video detectors to prevent the dissemination of false information via such videos. However, the development of high-performance AI-generated video detectors is currently impeded by the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets specifically designed for generative video detection. To this end, we introduce GenVidBench, a challenging AI-generated video detection dataset with several key advantages: 1) Large-scale video collection: The dataset contains 6.78 million videos and is currently the largest dataset for AI-generated video detection. 2) Cross-Source and Cross-Generator: The cross-source generation reduces the interference of video content on the detection. The cross-generator ensures diversity in video attributes between the training and test sets, preventing them from being overly similar. 3) State-of-the-Art Video Generators: The dataset includes videos from 11 state-of-the-art AI video generators, ensuring that it covers the latest advancements in the field of video generation. These generators ensure that the datasets are not only large in scale but also diverse, aiding in the development of generalized and effective detection models. Additionally, we present extensive experimental results with advanced video classification models. With GenVidBench, researchers can efficiently develop and evaluate AI-generated video detection models.. Datasets and code are available atthis https URL.
