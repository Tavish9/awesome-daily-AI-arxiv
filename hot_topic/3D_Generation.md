  Synthetic video generation with foundation models has gained attention for its realism and wide applications. While these models produce high-quality frames, they often fail to respect common sense and physical laws, resulting in abnormal content. Existing metrics like VideoScore emphasize general quality but ignore such violations and lack interpretability. A more insightful approach is using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as interpretable evaluators, as seen in FactScore. Yet, MLLMs' ability to detect abnormalities in synthetic videos remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce VideoHallu, a benchmark featuring synthetic videos from models like Veo2, Sora, and Kling, paired with expert-designed QA tasks solvable via human-level reasoning across various categories. We assess several SoTA MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen-2.5-VL, and newer models like Video-R1 and VideoChat-R1. Despite strong real-world performance on MVBench and MovieChat, these models still hallucinate on basic commonsense and physics tasks in synthetic settings, underscoring the challenge of hallucination. We further fine-tune SoTA MLLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on real and synthetic commonsense/physics data. Results show notable accuracy gains, especially with counterexample integration, advancing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our data is available atthis https URL.

- **[DualReal: Adaptive Joint Training for Lossless Identity-Motion Fusion in Video Customization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02192)**  `arXiv:2505.02192`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  Customized text-to-video generation with pre-trained large-scale models has recently garnered significant attention through focusing on identity and motion consistency. Existing works typically follow the isolated customized paradigm, where the subject identity or motion dynamics are customized exclusively. However, this paradigm completely ignores the intrinsic mutual constraints and synergistic interdependencies between identity and motion, resulting in identity-motion conflicts throughout the generation process that systematically degrades. To address this, we introduce DualReal, a novel framework that, employs adaptive joint training to collaboratively construct interdependencies between dimensions. Specifically, DualReal is composed of two units: (1) Dual-aware Adaptation dynamically selects a training phase (i.e., identity or motion), learns the current information guided by the frozen dimension prior, and employs a regularization strategy to avoid knowledge leakage; (2) StageBlender Controller leverages the denoising stages and Diffusion Transformer depths to guide different dimensions with adaptive granularity, avoiding conflicts at various stages and ultimately achieving lossless fusion of identity and motion patterns. We constructed a more comprehensive benchmark than existing methods. The experimental results show that DualReal improves CLIP-I and DINO-I metrics by 21.7% and 31.8% on average, and achieves top performance on nearly all motion quality metrics.

  This technical report presents a cost-efficient strategy for training a video generation foundation model. We present a mid-sized research model with approximately 7 billion parameters (7B) called Seaweed-7B trained from scratch using 665,000 H100 GPU hours. Despite being trained with moderate computational resources, Seaweed-7B demonstrates highly competitive performance compared to contemporary video generation models of much larger size. Design choices are especially crucial in a resource-constrained setting. This technical report highlights the key design decisions that enhance the performance of the medium-sized diffusion model. Empirically, we make two observations: (1) Seaweed-7B achieves performance comparable to, or even surpasses, larger models trained on substantially greater GPU resources, and (2) our model, which exhibits strong generalization ability, can be effectively adapted across a wide range of downstream applications either by lightweight fine-tuning or continue training.

- **[Scenethesis: A Language and Vision Agentic Framework for 3D Scene Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02836)**  `arXiv:2505.02836`  `cs.CV`

  Synthesizing interactive 3D scenes from text is essential for gaming, virtual reality, and embodied AI. However, existing methods face several challenges. Learning-based approaches depend on small-scale indoor datasets, limiting the scene diversity and layout complexity. While large language models (LLMs) can leverage diverse text-domain knowledge, they struggle with spatial realism, often producing unnatural object placements that fail to respect common sense. Our key insight is that vision perception can bridge this gap by providing realistic spatial guidance that LLMs lack. To this end, we introduce Scenethesis, a training-free agentic framework that integrates LLM-based scene planning with vision-guided layout refinement. Given a text prompt, Scenethesis first employs an LLM to draft a coarse layout. A vision module then refines it by generating an image guidance and extracting scene structure to capture inter-object relations. Next, an optimization module iteratively enforces accurate pose alignment and physical plausibility, preventing artifacts like object penetration and instability. Finally, a judge module verifies spatial coherence. Comprehensive experiments show that Scenethesis generates diverse, realistic, and physically plausible 3D interactive scenes, making it valuable for virtual content creation, simulation environments, and embodied AI research.

- **[MCCD: Multi-Agent Collaboration-based Compositional Diffusion for Complex Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02648)**  `arXiv:2505.02648`  `cs.CV`

  Diffusion models have shown excellent performance in text-to-image generation. Nevertheless, existing methods often suffer from performance bottlenecks when handling complex prompts that involve multiple objects, characteristics, and relations. Therefore, we propose a Multi-agent Collaboration-based Compositional Diffusion (MCCD) for text-to-image generation for complex scenes. Specifically, we design a multi-agent collaboration-based scene parsing module that generates an agent system comprising multiple agents with distinct tasks, utilizing MLLMs to extract various scene elements effectively. In addition, Hierarchical Compositional diffusion utilizes a Gaussian mask and filtering to refine bounding box regions and enhance objects through region enhancement, resulting in the accurate and high-fidelity generation of complex scenes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our MCCD significantly improves the performance of the baseline models in a training-free manner, providing a substantial advantage in complex scene generation.

  Accurate and high-fidelity driving scene reconstruction relies on fully leveraging scene information as conditioning. However, existing approaches, which primarily use 3D bounding boxes and binary maps for foreground and background control, fall short in capturing the complexity of the scene and integrating multi-modal information. In this paper, we propose DualDiff, a dual-branch conditional diffusion model designed to enhance multi-view driving scene generation. We introduce Occupancy Ray Sampling (ORS), a semantic-rich 3D representation, alongside numerical driving scene representation, for comprehensive foreground and background control. To improve cross-modal information integration, we propose a Semantic Fusion Attention (SFA) mechanism that aligns and fuses features across modalities. Furthermore, we design a foreground-aware masked (FGM) loss to enhance the generation of tiny objects. DualDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in FID score, as well as consistently better results in downstream BEV segmentation and 3D object detection tasks.

- **[PosePilot: Steering Camera Pose for Generative World Models with Self-supervised Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01729)**  `arXiv:2505.01729`  `cs.CV`

  Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) systems have highlighted the potential of world models in achieving robust and generalizable performance across both ordinary and challenging driving conditions. However, a key challenge remains: precise and flexible camera pose control, which is crucial for accurate viewpoint transformation and realistic simulation of scene dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PosePilot, a lightweight yet powerful framework that significantly enhances camera pose controllability in generative world models. Drawing inspiration from self-supervised depth estimation, PosePilot leverages structure-from-motion principles to establish a tight coupling between camera pose and video generation. Specifically, we incorporate self-supervised depth and pose readouts, allowing the model to infer depth and relative camera motion directly from video sequences. These outputs drive pose-aware frame warping, guided by a photometric warping loss that enforces geometric consistency across synthesized frames. To further refine camera pose estimation, we introduce a reverse warping step and a pose regression loss, improving viewpoint precision and adaptability. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving and general-domain video datasets demonstrate that PosePilot significantly enhances structural understanding and motion reasoning in both diffusion-based and auto-regressive world models. By steering camera pose with self-supervised depth, PosePilot sets a new benchmark for pose controllability, enabling physically consistent, reliable viewpoint synthesis in generative world models.

  3D meshes are widely used in computer vision and graphics for their efficiency in animation and minimal memory use, playing a crucial role in movies, games, AR, and VR. However, creating temporally consistent and realistic textures for mesh sequences remains labor-intensive for professional artists. On the other hand, while video diffusion models excel at text-driven video generation, they often lack 3D geometry awareness and struggle with achieving multi-view consistent texturing for 3D meshes. In this work, we present Tex4D, a zero-shot approach that integrates inherent 3D geometry knowledge from mesh sequences with the expressiveness of video diffusion models to produce multi-view and temporally consistent 4D textures. Given an untextured mesh sequence and a text prompt as inputs, our method enhances multi-view consistency by synchronizing the diffusion process across different views through latent aggregation in the UV space. To ensure temporal consistency, we leverage prior knowledge from a conditional video generation model for texture synthesis. However, straightforwardly combining the video diffusion model and the UV texture aggregation leads to blurry results. We analyze the underlying causes and propose a simple yet effective modification to the DDIM sampling process to address this issue. Additionally, we introduce a reference latent texture to strengthen the correlation between frames during the denoising process. To the best of our knowledge, Tex4D is the first method specifically designed for 4D scene texturing. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority in producing multi-view and multi-frame consistent videos based on untextured mesh sequences.
