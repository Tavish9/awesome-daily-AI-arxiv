- **[Sparse VideoGen: Accelerating Video Diffusion Transformers with Spatial-Temporal Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01776)**  `arXiv:2502.01776`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) dominate video generation but their high computational cost severely limits real-world applicability, usually requiring tens of minutes to generate a few seconds of video even on high-performance GPUs. This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality.

- **[Audio-Driven Talking Face Video Generation with Joint Uncertainty Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18810)**  `arXiv:2504.18810`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  Talking face video generation with arbitrary speech audio is a significant challenge within the realm of digital human technology. The previous studies have emphasized the significance of audio-lip synchronization and visual quality. Currently, limited attention has been given to the learning of visual uncertainty, which creates several issues in existing systems, including inconsistent visual quality and unreliable performance across different input conditions. To address the problem, we propose a Joint Uncertainty Learning Network (JULNet) for high-quality talking face video generation, which incorporates a representation of uncertainty that is directly related to visual error. Specifically, we first design an uncertainty module to individually predict the error map and uncertainty map after obtaining the generated image. The error map represents the difference between the generated image and the ground truth image, while the uncertainty map is used to predict the probability of incorrect estimates. Furthermore, to match the uncertainty distribution with the error distribution through a KL divergence term, we introduce a histogram technique to approximate the distributions. By jointly optimizing error and uncertainty, the performance and robustness of our model can be enhanced. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior high-fidelity and audio-lip synchronization in talking face video generation compared to previous methods.

  Stereo video synthesis from a monocular input is a demanding task in the fields of spatial computing and virtual reality. The main challenges of this task lie on the insufficiency of high-quality paired stereo videos for training and the difficulty of maintaining the spatio-temporal consistency between frames. Existing methods primarily address these issues by directly applying novel view synthesis (NVS) techniques to video, while facing limitations such as the inability to effectively represent dynamic scenes and the requirement for large amounts of training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-supervised stereo video synthesis paradigm via a video diffusion model, termed SpatialDreamer, which meets the challenges head-on. Firstly, to address the stereo video data insufficiency, we propose a Depth based Video Generation module DVG, which employs a forward-backward rendering mechanism to generate paired videos with geometric and temporal priors. Leveraging data generated by DVG, we propose RefinerNet along with a self-supervised synthetic framework designed to facilitate efficient and dedicated training. More importantly, we devise a consistency control module, which consists of a metric of stereo deviation strength and a Temporal Interaction Learning module TIL for geometric and temporal consistency ensurance respectively. We evaluated the proposed method against various benchmark methods, with the results showcasing its superior performance.

  With the continuous progress of visual generation technologies, the scale of video datasets has grown exponentially. The quality of these datasets plays a pivotal role in the performance of video generation models. We assert that temporal splitting, detailed captions, and video quality filtering are three crucial determinants of dataset quality. However, existing datasets exhibit various limitations in these areas. To address these challenges, we introduce Koala-36M, a large-scale, high-quality video dataset featuring accurate temporal splitting, detailed captions, and superior video quality. The essence of our approach lies in improving the consistency between fine-grained conditions and video content. Specifically, we employ a linear classifier on probability distributions to enhance the accuracy of transition detection, ensuring better temporal consistency. We then provide structured captions for the splitted videos, with an average length of 200 words, to improve text-video alignment. Additionally, we develop a Video Training Suitability Score (VTSS) that integrates multiple sub-metrics, allowing us to filter high-quality videos from the original corpus. Finally, we incorporate several metrics into the training process of the generation model, further refining the fine-grained conditions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our data processing pipeline and the quality of the proposed Koala-36M dataset. Our dataset and code have been released atthis https URL.

- **[CoherenDream: Boosting Holistic Text Coherence in 3D Generation via Multimodal Large Language Models Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19860)**  `arXiv:2504.19860`  `cs.CV`

  Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has achieved remarkable success in text-to-3D content generation. However, SDS-based methods struggle to maintain semantic fidelity for user prompts, particularly when involving multiple objects with intricate interactions. While existing approaches often address 3D consistency through multiview diffusion model fine-tuning on 3D datasets, this strategy inadvertently exacerbates text-3D alignment degradation. The limitation stems from SDS's inherent accumulation of view-independent biases during optimization, which progressively diverges from the ideal text alignment direction. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel SDS objective, dubbed as Textual Coherent Score Distillation (TCSD), which integrates alignment feedback from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our TCSD leverages cross-modal understanding capabilities of MLLMs to assess and guide the text-3D correspondence during the optimization. We further develop 3DLLaVA-CRITIC - a fine-tuned MLLM specialized for evaluating multiview text alignment in 3D generations. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-layout initialization that significantly accelerates optimization convergence through semantic-aware spatial configuration. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework, CoherenDream, establishes state-of-the-art performance in text-aligned 3D generation across multiple benchmarks, including T$^3$Bench and TIFA subset. Qualitative results showcase the superior performance of CoherenDream in preserving textual consistency and semantic interactions. As the first study to incorporate MLLMs into SDS optimization, we also conduct extensive ablation studies to explore optimal MLLM adaptations for 3D generation tasks.

- **[DiVE: Efficient Multi-View Driving Scenes Generation Based on Video Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19614)**  `arXiv:2504.19614`  `cs.CV`

  Collecting multi-view driving scenario videos to enhance the performance of 3D visual perception tasks presents significant challenges and incurs substantial costs, making generative models for realistic data an appealing alternative. Yet, the videos generated by recent works suffer from poor quality and spatiotemporal consistency, undermining their utility in advancing perception tasks under driving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose DiVE, a diffusion transformer-based generative framework meticulously engineered to produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent, and cross-view consistent multi-view videos, aligning seamlessly with bird's-eye view layouts and textual descriptions. DiVE leverages a unified cross-attention and a SketchFormer to exert precise control over multimodal data, while incorporating a view-inflated attention mechanism that adds no extra parameters, thereby guaranteeing consistency across views. Despite these advancements, synthesizing high-resolution videos under multimodal constraints introduces dual challenges: investigating the optimal classifier-free guidance coniguration under intricate multi-condition inputs and mitigating excessive computational latency in high-resolution rendering--both of which remain underexplored in prior researches. To resolve these limitations, we introduce two innovations: Multi-Control Auxiliary Branch Distillation, which streamlines multi-condition CFG selection while circumventing high computational overhead, and Resolution Progressive Sampling, a training-free acceleration strategy that staggers resolution scaling to reduce high latency due to high resolution. These innovations collectively achieve a 2.62x speedup with minimal quality degradation. Evaluated on the nuScenes dataset, DiVE achieves SOTA performance in multi-view video generation, yielding photorealistic outputs with exceptional temporal and cross-view coherence.

- **[CasaGPT: Cuboid Arrangement and Scene Assembly for Interior Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19478)**  `arXiv:2504.19478`  `cs.CV`  
  _Weitao Feng, Hang Zhou, Jing Liao, Li Cheng, Wenbo Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel approach for indoor scene synthesis, which learns to arrange decomposed cuboid primitives to represent 3D objects within a scene. Unlike conventional methods that use bounding boxes to determine the placement and scale of 3D objects, our approach leverages cuboids as a straightforward yet highly effective alternative for modeling objects. This allows for compact scene generation while minimizing object intersections. Our approach, coined CasaGPT for Cuboid Arrangement and Scene Assembly, employs an autoregressive model to sequentially arrange cuboids, producing physically plausible scenes. By applying rejection sampling during the fine-tuning stage to filter out scenes with object collisions, our model further reduces intersections and enhances scene quality. Additionally, we introduce a refined dataset, 3DFRONT-NC, which eliminates significant noise presented in the original dataset, 3D-FRONT. Extensive experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset as well as our dataset demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, enhancing the realism of generated scenes, and providing a promising direction for 3D scene synthesis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of video generation has rendered existing evaluation systems inadequate for assessing state-of-the-art models, primarily due to simple prompts that cannot showcase the model's capabilities, fixed evaluation operators struggling with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) cases, and misalignment between computed metrics and human preferences. To bridge the gap, we propose VideoGen-Eval, an agent evaluation system that integrates LLM-based content structuring, MLLM-based content judgment, and patch tools designed for temporal-dense dimensions, to achieve a dynamic, flexible, and expandable video generation evaluation. Additionally, we introduce a video generation benchmark to evaluate existing cutting-edge models and verify the effectiveness of our evaluation system. It comprises 700 structured, content-rich prompts (both T2V and I2V) and over 12,000 videos generated by 20+ models, among them, 8 cutting-edge models are selected as quantitative evaluation for the agent and human. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed agent-based evaluation system demonstrates strong alignment with human preferences and reliably completes the evaluation, as well as the diversity and richness of the benchmark.

  How can one efficiently generate high-quality, wide-scope 3D scenes from arbitrary single images? Existing methods suffer several drawbacks, such as requiring multi-view data, time-consuming per-scene optimization, distorted geometry in occluded areas, and low visual quality in backgrounds. Our novel 3D scene reconstruction pipeline overcomes these limitations to tackle the aforesaid challenge. Specifically, we introduce a large-scale reconstruction model that leverages latents from a video diffusion model to predict 3D Gaussian Splattings of scenes in a feed-forward manner. The video diffusion model is designed to create videos precisely following specified camera trajectories, allowing it to generate compressed video latents that encode multi-view information while maintaining 3D consistency. We train the 3D reconstruction model to operate on the video latent space with a progressive learning strategy, enabling the efficient generation of high-quality, wide-scope, and generic 3D scenes. Extensive evaluations across various datasets affirm that our model significantly outperforms existing single-view 3D scene generation methods, especially with out-of-domain images. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that a 3D reconstruction model can effectively be built upon the latent space of a diffusion model in order to realize efficient 3D scene generation.

  Generating engaging, accurate short-form videos from scientific papers is challenging due to content complexity and the gap between expert authors and readers. Existing end-to-end methods often suffer from factual inaccuracies and visual artifacts, limiting their utility for scientific dissemination. To address these issues, we propose SciTalk, a novel multi-LLM agentic framework, grounding videos in various sources, such as text, figures, visual styles, and avatars. Inspired by content creators' workflows, SciTalk uses specialized agents for content summarization, visual scene planning, and text and layout editing, and incorporates an iterative feedback mechanism where video agents simulate user roles to give feedback on generated videos from previous iterations and refine generation prompts. Experimental evaluations show that SciTalk outperforms simple prompting methods in generating scientifically accurate and engaging content over the refined loop of video generation. Although preliminary results are still not yet matching human creators' quality, our framework provides valuable insights into the challenges and benefits of feedback-driven video generation. Our code, data, and generated videos will be publicly available.

- **[A Survey of AI Agent Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16736)**  `arXiv:2504.16736`  `cs.AI`

  The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment of LLM agents across diverse industries, including customer service, content generation, data analysis, and even healthcare. However, as more LLM agents are deployed, a major issue has emerged: there is no standard way for these agents to communicate with external tools or data sources. This lack of standardized protocols makes it difficult for agents to work together or scale effectively, and it limits their ability to tackle complex, real-world tasks. A unified communication protocol for LLM agents could change this. It would allow agents and tools to interact more smoothly, encourage collaboration, and triggering the formation of collective intelligence. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of existing agent protocols, proposing a systematic two-dimensional classification that differentiates context-oriented versus inter-agent protocols and general-purpose versus domain-specific protocols. Additionally, we conduct a comparative performance analysis of these protocols across key dimensions such as security, scalability, and latency. Finally, we explore the future landscape of agent protocols by identifying critical research directions and characteristics necessary for next-generation protocols. These characteristics include adaptability, privacy preservation, and group-based interaction, as well as trends toward layered architectures and collective intelligence infrastructures. We expect this work to serve as a practical reference for both researchers and engineers seeking to design, evaluate, or integrate robust communication infrastructures for intelligent agents.
