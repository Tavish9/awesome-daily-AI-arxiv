- **[BrokenVideos: A Benchmark Dataset for Fine-Grained Artifact Localization in AI-Generated Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20103)**  `arXiv:2506.20103`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  Recent advances in deep generative models have led to significant progress in video generation, yet the fidelity of AI-generated videos remains limited. Synthesized content often exhibits visual artifacts such as temporally inconsistent motion, physically implausible trajectories, unnatural object deformations, and local blurring that undermine realism and user trust. Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved generative models. However, the research community currently lacks a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI generated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs) on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted regions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos establishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on artifact localization in generative video models. The dataset is available at:this https URL.

  Traditionally, 3D scene synthesis requires expert knowledge and significant manual effort. Automating this process could greatly benefit fields such as architectural design, robotics simulation, virtual reality, and gaming. Recent approaches to 3D scene synthesis often rely on the commonsense reasoning of large language models (LLMs) or strong visual priors of modern image generation models. However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability, which restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes. Meanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in viewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies. In this work, we present Video Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework that exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in video generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object placements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and seamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and open-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze each object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism and structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce First-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation, utilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning ability of multimodal large language models. Extensive experiments show that VIPScene significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across diverse scenarios. The code will be released.

- **[WonderFree: Enhancing Novel View Quality and Cross-View Consistency for 3D Scene Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20590)**  `arXiv:2506.20590`  `cs.CV`

  Interactive 3D scene generation from a single image has gained significant attention due to its potential to create immersive virtual worlds. However, a key challenge in current 3D generation methods is the limited explorability, which cannot render high-quality images during larger maneuvers beyond the original viewpoint, particularly when attempting to move forward into unseen areas. To address this challenge, we propose WonderFree, the first model that enables users to interactively generate 3D worlds with the freedom to explore from arbitrary angles and directions. Specifically, we decouple this challenge into two key subproblems: novel view quality, which addresses visual artifacts and floating issues in novel views, and cross-view consistency, which ensures spatial consistency across different viewpoints. To enhance rendering quality in novel views, we introduce WorldRestorer, a data-driven video restoration model designed to eliminate floaters and artifacts. In addition, a data collection pipeline is presented to automatically gather training data for WorldRestorer, ensuring it can handle scenes with varying styles needed for 3D scene generation. Furthermore, to improve cross-view consistency, we propose ConsistView, a multi-view joint restoration mechanism that simultaneously restores multiple perspectives while maintaining spatiotemporal coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that WonderFree not only enhances rendering quality across diverse viewpoints but also significantly improves global coherence and consistency. These improvements are confirmed by CLIP-based metrics and a user study showing a 77.20% preference for WonderFree over WonderWorld enabling a seamless and immersive 3D exploration experience. The code, model, and data will be publicly available.

- **[PanoWan: Lifting Diffusion Video Generation Models to 360¬∞ with Latitude/Longitude-aware Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22016)**  `arXiv:2505.22016`  `cs.CV`

  Panoramic video generation enables immersive 360¬∞ content creation, valuable in applications that demand scene-consistent world exploration. However, existing panoramic video generation models struggle to leverage pre-trained generative priors from conventional text-to-video models for high-quality and diverse panoramic videos generation, due to limited dataset scale and the gap in spatial feature representations. In this paper, we introduce PanoWan to effectively lift pre-trained text-to-video models to the panoramic domain, equipped with minimal modules. PanoWan employs latitude-aware sampling to avoid latitudinal distortion, while its rotated semantic denoising and padded pixel-wise decoding ensure seamless transitions at longitude boundaries. To provide sufficient panoramic videos for learning these lifted representations, we contribute PanoVid, a high-quality panoramic video dataset with captions and diverse scenarios. Consequently, PanoWan achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoramic video generation and demonstrates robustness for zero-shot downstream tasks. Our project page is available atthis https URL.

- **[Understanding World or Predicting Future? A Comprehensive Survey of World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14499)**  `arXiv:2411.14499`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  The concept of world models has garnered significant attention due to advancements in multimodal large language models such as GPT-4 and video generation models such as Sora, which are central to the pursuit of artificial general intelligence. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the literature on world models. Generally, world models are regarded as tools for either understanding the present state of the world or predicting its future dynamics. This review presents a systematic categorization of world models, emphasizing two primary functions: (1) constructing internal representations to understand the mechanisms of the world, and (2) predicting future states to simulate and guide decision-making. Initially, we examine the current progress in these two categories. We then explore the application of world models in key domains, including autonomous driving, robotics, and social simulacra, with a focus on how each domain utilizes these aspects. Finally, we outline key challenges and provide insights into potential future research directions. We summarize the representative papers along with their code repositories inthis https URL.
