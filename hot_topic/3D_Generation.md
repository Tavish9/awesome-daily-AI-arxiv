- **[Evaluating Robot Policies in a World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00613)**  `arXiv:2506.00613`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Robotics has broad applications from automating house chores to taking care of patients. However, evaluating robot control policies is challenging, as real-world testing is expensive, while handcrafted simulations often fail to accurately reflect real-world conditions, resulting in poor correlation between simulated evaluation and real-world outcomes. In this work, we investigate World-model-based Policy Evaluation (WPE). We first train an action-conditioned video generation model as a proxy to real-world environments. To enable efficient rollouts of hundreds of interactive steps while mitigating error accumulation in the world model, we propose an inference scheme which we call Blockwise-Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer with adjustable context and decoding horizon lengths. To ensure that the world model indeed follows action input, we propose metrics based on the agreement between the ground truth video and generated video conditioned on the same sequence of actions to evaluate the world model. We then use the world model for policy evaluation by performing Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model while employing a vision-language model (VLM) as a reward function. Interestingly, we found that WPE tends to underestimate the policy values for in-distribution actions and overestimate policy values for out-of-distribution actions. Nevertheless, WPE preserves the relative rankings of different policies. In emulating real robot executions, WPE achieves high fidelity in mimicing robot arm movements as in real videos, while emulating highly realistic object interaction remains challenging. Despite this limitation, we show that a world model can serve as a starting point for evaluating robot policies before real-world deployment.

  Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art results in text-to-image, text-to-video generation, and editing. However, their large model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and quality.We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency. Applied to OpenSora, Latte, and CogVideoX, Foresight achieves up to 1.63x end-to-end speedup, while maintaining video quality. The source code of Foresight is available at \texttt{this https URL}.

  Autoregressive modeling has been a huge success in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, i.e., pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the representation strategy. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multifaceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multimodal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at:this https URL.

- **[Ctrl-Crash: Controllable Diffusion for Realistic Car Crashes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00227)**  `arXiv:2506.00227`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video diffusion techniques have advanced significantly in recent years; however, they struggle to generate realistic imagery of car crashes due to the scarcity of accident events in most driving datasets. Improving traffic safety requires realistic and controllable accident simulations. To tackle the problem, we propose Ctrl-Crash, a controllable car crash video generation model that conditions on signals such as bounding boxes, crash types, and an initial image frame. Our approach enables counterfactual scenario generation where minor variations in input can lead to dramatically different crash outcomes. To support fine-grained control at inference time, we leverage classifier-free guidance with independently tunable scales for each conditioning signal. Ctrl-Crash achieves state-of-the-art performance across quantitative video quality metrics (e.g., FVD and JEDi) and qualitative measurements based on a human-evaluation of physical realism and video quality compared to prior diffusion-based methods.

- **[Playing with Transformer at 30+ FPS via Next-Frame Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01380)**  `arXiv:2506.01380`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Xinle Cheng, Tianyu He, Jiayi Xu, Junliang Guo, Di He, Jiang Bian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive video models offer distinct advantages over bidirectional diffusion models in creating interactive video content and supporting streaming applications with arbitrary duration. In this work, we present Next-Frame Diffusion (NFD), an autoregressive diffusion transformer that incorporates block-wise causal attention, enabling iterative sampling and efficient inference via parallel token generation within each frame. Nonetheless, achieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such models, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion sampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation. To address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency distillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models, enabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage parallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often share the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling. In this approach, the model generates next few frames using current action input, and discard speculatively generated frames if the input action differs. Experiments on a large-scale action-conditioned video generation benchmark demonstrate that NFD beats autoregressive baselines in terms of both visual quality and sampling efficiency. We, for the first time, achieves autoregressive video generation at over 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an A100 GPU using a 310M model.

- **[Learning Video Generation for Robotic Manipulation with Collaborative Trajectory Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01943)**  `arXiv:2506.01943`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xiao Fu, Xintao Wang, Xian Liu, Jianhong Bai, Runsen Xu, Pengfei Wan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in video diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further enabling fine-grained control. However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.

- **[OmniV2V: Versatile Video Generation and Editing via Dynamic Content Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01801)**  `arXiv:2506.01801`  `cs.CV`  
  _Sen Liang, Zhentao Yu, Zhengguang Zhou, Teng Hu, Hongmei Wang, Yi Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) has brought significant advancements to video generation, especially in text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. Although video generation is widely applied in various fields, most existing models are limited to single scenarios and cannot perform diverse video generation and editing through dynamic content manipulation. We propose OmniV2V, a video model capable of generating and editing videos across different scenarios based on various operations, including: object movement, object addition, mask-guided video edit, try-on, inpainting, outpainting, human animation, and controllable character video synthesis. We explore a unified dynamic content manipulation injection module, which effectively integrates the requirements of the above tasks. In addition, we design a visual-text instruction module based on LLaVA, enabling the model to effectively understand the correspondence between visual content and instructions. Furthermore, we build a comprehensive multi-task data processing system. Since there is data overlap among various tasks, this system can efficiently provide data augmentation. Using this system, we construct a multi-type, multi-scenario OmniV2V dataset and its corresponding OmniV2V-Test benchmark. Extensive experiments show that OmniV2V works as well as, and sometimes better than, the best existing open-source and commercial models for many video generation and editing tasks.

- **[WorldExplorer: Towards Generating Fully Navigable 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01799)**  `arXiv:2506.01799`  `cs.CV`  
  _Manuel-Andreas Schneider, Lukas H√∂llein, Matthias Nie√üner_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating 3D worlds from text is a highly anticipated goal in computer vision. Existing works are limited by the degree of exploration they allow inside of a scene, i.e., produce streched-out and noisy artifacts when moving beyond central or panoramic perspectives. To this end, we propose WorldExplorer, a novel method based on autoregressive video trajectory generation, which builds fully navigable 3D scenes with consistent visual quality across a wide range of viewpoints. We initialize our scenes by creating multi-view consistent images corresponding to a 360 degree panorama. Then, we expand it by leveraging video diffusion models in an iterative scene generation pipeline. Concretely, we generate multiple videos along short, pre-defined trajectories, that explore the scene in depth, including motion around objects. Our novel scene memory conditions each video on the most relevant prior views, while a collision-detection mechanism prevents degenerate results, like moving into objects. Finally, we fuse all generated views into a unified 3D representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization. Compared to prior approaches, WorldExplorer produces high-quality scenes that remain stable under large camera motion, enabling for the first time realistic and unrestricted exploration. We believe this marks a significant step toward generating immersive and truly explorable virtual 3D environments.

- **[Many-for-Many: Unify the Training of Multiple Video and Image Generation and Manipulation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01758)**  `arXiv:2506.01758`  `cs.CV`  
  _Tao Yang, Ruibin Li, Yangming Shi, Yuqi Zhang, Qide Dong, Haoran Cheng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have shown impressive performance in many visual generation and manipulation tasks. Many existing methods focus on training a model for a specific task, especially, text-to-video (T2V) generation, while many other works focus on finetuning the pretrained T2V model for image-to-video (I2V), video-to-video (V2V), image and video manipulation tasks, etc. However, training a strong T2V foundation model requires a large amount of high-quality annotations, which is very costly. In addition, many existing models can perform only one or several tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, namely many-for-many, which leverages the available training data from many different visual generation and manipulation tasks to train a single model for those different tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight adapter to unify the different conditions in different tasks, then employ a joint image-video learning strategy to progressively train the model from scratch. Our joint learning leads to a unified visual generation and manipulation model with improved video generation performance. In addition, we introduce depth maps as a condition to help our model better perceive the 3D space in visual generation. Two versions of our model are trained with different model sizes (8B and 2B), each of which can perform more than 10 different tasks. In particular, our 8B model demonstrates highly competitive performance in video generation tasks compared to open-source and even commercial engines. Our models and source codes are available atthis https URL.

  _Xiaodong Wang, Zhirong Wu, Peixi Peng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Driving world models are used to simulate futures by video generation based on the condition of the current state and actions. However, current models often suffer serious error accumulations when predicting the long-term future, which limits the practical application. Recent studies utilize the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) as the backbone of driving world models to improve learning flexibility. However, these models are always trained on short video clips (high fps and short duration), and multiple roll-out generations struggle to produce consistent and reasonable long videos due to the training-inference gap. To this end, we propose several solutions to build a simple yet effective long-term driving world model. First, we hierarchically decouple world model learning into large motion learning and bidirectional continuous motion learning. Then, considering the continuity of driving scenes, we propose a simple distillation method where fine-grained video flows are self-supervised signals for coarse-grained flows. The distillation is designed to improve the coherence of infinite video generation. The coarse-grained and fine-grained modules are coordinated to generate long-term and temporally coherent videos. In the public benchmark NuScenes, compared with the state-of-the-art front-view model, our model improves FVD by $27\%$ and reduces inference time by $85\%$ for the video task of generating 110+ frames. More videos (including 90s duration) are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in diffusion models have revolutionized video generation, enabling the creation of high-quality, temporally consistent videos. However, generating high frame-rate (FPS) videos remains a significant challenge due to issues such as flickering and degradation in long sequences, particularly in fast-motion scenarios. Existing methods often suffer from computational inefficiencies and limitations in maintaining video quality over extended frames. In this paper, we present a novel, training-free approach for high FPS video generation using pre-trained diffusion models. Our method, DiffuseSlide, introduces a new pipeline that leverages key frames from low FPS videos and applies innovative techniques, including noise re-injection and sliding window latent denoising, to achieve smooth, consistent video outputs without the need for additional fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves video quality, offering enhanced temporal coherence and spatial fidelity. The proposed method is not only computationally efficient but also adaptable to various video generation tasks, making it ideal for applications such as virtual reality, video games, and high-quality content creation.

- **[FlowMo: Variance-Based Flow Guidance for Coherent Motion in Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01144)**  `arXiv:2506.01144`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ariel Shaulov, Itay Hazan, Lior Wolf, Hila Chefer_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-video diffusion models are notoriously limited in their ability to model temporal aspects such as motion, physics, and dynamic interactions. Existing approaches address this limitation by retraining the model or introducing external conditioning signals to enforce temporal consistency. In this work, we explore whether a meaningful temporal representation can be extracted directly from the predictions of a pre-trained model without any additional training or auxiliary inputs. We introduce \textbf{FlowMo}, a novel training-free guidance method that enhances motion coherence using only the model's own predictions in each diffusion step. FlowMo first derives an appearance-debiased temporal representation by measuring the distance between latents corresponding to consecutive frames. This highlights the implicit temporal structure predicted by the model. It then estimates motion coherence by measuring the patch-wise variance across the temporal dimension and guides the model to reduce this variance dynamically during sampling. Extensive experiments across multiple text-to-video models demonstrate that FlowMo significantly improves motion coherence without sacrificing visual quality or prompt alignment, offering an effective plug-and-play solution for enhancing the temporal fidelity of pre-trained video diffusion models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  World models serve as essential building blocks toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), enabling intelligent agents to predict future states and plan actions by simulating complex physical interactions. However, existing interactive models primarily predict visual observations, thereby neglecting crucial hidden states like geometric structures and spatial coherence. This leads to rapid error accumulation and temporal inconsistency. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepVerse, a novel 4D interactive world model explicitly incorporating geometric predictions from previous timesteps into current predictions conditioned on actions. Experiments demonstrate that by incorporating explicit geometric constraints, DeepVerse captures richer spatio-temporal relationships and underlying physical dynamics. This capability significantly reduces drift and enhances temporal consistency, enabling the model to reliably generate extended future sequences and achieve substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, visual realism, and scene rationality. Furthermore, our method provides an effective solution for geometry-aware memory retrieval, effectively preserving long-term spatial consistency. We validate the effectiveness of DeepVerse across diverse scenarios, establishing its capacity for high-fidelity, long-horizon predictions grounded in geometry-aware dynamics.

- **[Temporal In-Context Fine-Tuning for Versatile Control of Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00996)**  `arXiv:2506.00996`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kinam Kim, Junha Hyung, Jaegul Choo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, but controllable generation remains challenging, particularly under limited data and compute. Existing fine-tuning methods for conditional generation often rely on external encoders or architectural modifications, which demand large datasets and are typically restricted to spatially aligned conditioning, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce Temporal In-Context Fine-Tuning (TIC-FT), an efficient and versatile approach for adapting pretrained video diffusion models to diverse conditional generation tasks. Our key idea is to concatenate condition and target frames along the temporal axis and insert intermediate buffer frames with progressively increasing noise levels. These buffer frames enable smooth transitions, aligning the fine-tuning process with the pretrained model's temporal dynamics. TIC-FT requires no architectural changes and achieves strong performance with as few as 10-30 training samples. We validate our method across a range of tasks, including image-to-video and video-to-video generation, using large-scale base models such as CogVideoX-5B and Wan-14B. Extensive experiments show that TIC-FT outperforms existing baselines in both condition fidelity and visual quality, while remaining highly efficient in both training and inference.

- **[SatDreamer360: Geometry Consistent Street-View Video Generation from Satellite Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00600)**  `arXiv:2506.00600`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xianghui Ze, Beiyi Zhu, Zhenbo Song, Jianfeng Lu, Yujiao Shi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating continuous ground-level video from satellite imagery is a challenging task with significant potential for applications in simulation, autonomous navigation, and digital twin cities. Existing approaches primarily focus on synthesizing individual ground-view images, often relying on auxiliary inputs like height maps or handcrafted projections, and fall short in producing temporally consistent sequences. In this paper, we propose {SatDreamer360}, a novel framework that generates geometrically and temporally consistent ground-view video from a single satellite image and a predefined trajectory. To bridge the large viewpoint gap, we introduce a compact tri-plane representation that encodes scene geometry directly from the satellite image. A ray-based pixel attention mechanism retrieves view-dependent features from the tri-plane, enabling accurate cross-view correspondence without requiring additional geometric priors. To ensure multi-frame consistency, we propose an epipolar-constrained temporal attention module that aligns features across frames using the known relative poses along the trajectory. To support evaluation, we introduce {VIGOR++}, a large-scale dataset for cross-view video generation, with dense trajectory annotations and high-quality ground-view sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SatDreamer360 achieves superior performance in fidelity, coherence, and geometric alignment across diverse urban scenes.

  _Yuta Oshima, Masahiro Suzuki, Yutaka Matsuo, Hiroki Furuta_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The remarkable progress in text-to-video diffusion models enables photorealistic generations, although the contents of the generated video often include unnatural movement or deformation, reverse playback, and motionless scenes. Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some quantity on the goodness of the content. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select a better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward, at inference time. We then point out that the improvement of perceptual video quality considering the alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. This is because when humans or vision language models evaluate outputs, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with evaluation. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality evaluated on the calibrated reward, VLMs, and human assessment, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling under much more efficient computational cost. The experiments highlight that our method is beneficial to many capable generative models, and provide a practical guideline that we should prioritize the inference-time compute allocation into lookahead steps for reward estimation over search budget or denoising steps.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Character animation is a transformative field in computer graphics and vision, enabling dynamic and realistic video animations from static images. Despite advancements, maintaining appearance consistency in animations remains a challenge. Our approach addresses this by introducing a training-free framework that ensures the generated video sequence preserves the reference image's subtleties, such as physique and proportions, through a dual alignment strategy. We decouple skeletal and motion priors from pose information, enabling precise control over animation generation. Our method also improves pixel-level alignment for conditional control from the reference character, enhancing the temporal consistency and visual cohesion of animations. Our method significantly enhances the quality of video generation without the need for large datasets or expensive computational resources.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Querying generative AI models, e.g., large language models (LLMs), has become a prevalent method for information acquisition. However, existing query-answer datasets primarily focus on textual responses, making it challenging to address complex user queries that require visual demonstrations or explanations for better understanding. To bridge this gap, we construct a benchmark, RealVideoQuest, designed to evaluate the abilities of text-to-video (T2V) models in answering real-world, visually grounded queries. It identifies 7.5K real user queries with video response intents from Chatbot-Arena and builds 4.5K high-quality query-video pairs through a multistage video retrieval and refinement process. We further develop a multi-angle evaluation system to assess the quality of generated video answers. Experiments indicate that current T2V models struggle with effectively addressing real user queries, pointing to key challenges and future research opportunities in multimodal AI.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To address the challenge of information overload from massive web contents, recommender systems are widely applied to retrieve and present personalized results for users. However, recommendation tasks are inherently constrained to filtering existing items and lack the ability to generate novel concepts, limiting their capacity to fully satisfy user demands and preferences. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm that goes beyond content filtering and selecting: directly generating personalized items in a multimodal form, such as images, tailored to individual users. To accomplish this, we leverage any-to-any Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and train them in both supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning strategy to equip them with the ability to yield tailored next items for users. Experiments on two benchmark datasets and user study confirm the efficacy of the proposed method. Notably, the generated images not only align well with users' historical preferences but also exhibit relevance to their potential future interests.

  _Xiao Yang, Jiawei Chen, Jun Luo, Zhengwei Fang, Yinpeng Dong, Hang Su, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of multimodal LLM-based agents (MLAs) has transformed interaction paradigms by seamlessly integrating vision, language, action and dynamic environments, enabling unprecedented autonomous capabilities across GUI applications ranging from web automation to mobile systems. However, MLAs introduce critical trustworthiness challenges that extend far beyond traditional language models' limitations, as they can directly modify digital states and trigger irreversible real-world consequences. Existing benchmarks inadequately tackle these unique challenges posed by MLAs' actionable outputs, long-horizon uncertainty and multimodal attack vectors. In this paper, we introduce MLA-Trust, the first comprehensive and unified framework that evaluates the MLA trustworthiness across four principled dimensions: truthfulness, controllability, safety and privacy. We utilize websites and mobile applications as realistic testbeds, designing 34 high-risk interactive tasks and curating rich evaluation datasets. Large-scale experiments involving 13 state-of-the-art agents reveal previously unexplored trustworthiness vulnerabilities unique to multimodal interactive scenarios. For instance, proprietary and open-source GUI-interacting MLAs pose more severe trustworthiness risks than static MLLMs, particularly in high-stakes domains; the transition from static MLLMs into interactive MLAs considerably compromises trustworthiness, enabling harmful content generation in multi-step interactions that standalone MLLMs would typically prevent; multi-step execution, while enhancing the adaptability of MLAs, involves latent nonlinear risk accumulation across successive interactions, circumventing existing safeguards and resulting in unpredictable derived risks. Moreover, we present an extensible toolbox to facilitate continuous evaluation of MLA trustworthiness across diverse interactive environments.

  Artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC), a rapidly advancing technology, is transforming content creation across domains, such as text, images, audio, and video. Its growing potential has attracted more and more researchers and investors to explore and expand its possibilities. This review traces AIGC's evolution through four developmental milestones-ranging from early rule-based systems to modern transfer learning models-within a unified framework that highlights how each milestone contributes uniquely to content generation. In particular, the paper employs a common example across all milestones to illustrate the capabilities and limitations of methods within each phase, providing a consistent evaluation of AIGC methodologies and their development. Furthermore, this paper addresses critical challenges associated with AIGC and proposes actionable strategies to mitigate them. This study aims to guide researchers and practitioners in selecting and optimizing AIGC models to enhance the quality and efficiency of content creation across diverse domains.
