- **[Diffusion-Driven Semantic Communication for Generative Models with Bandwidth Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18468)**  `arXiv:2407.18468`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  Diffusion models have been extensively utilized in AI-generated content (AIGC) in recent years, thanks to the superior generation capabilities. Combining with semantic communications, diffusion models are used for tasks such as denoising, data reconstruction, and content generation. However, existing diffusion-based generative models do not consider the stringent bandwidth limitation, which limits its application in wireless communication. This paper introduces a diffusion-driven semantic communication framework with advanced VAE-based compression for bandwidth-constrained generative model. Our designed architecture utilizes the diffusion model, where the signal transmission process through the wireless channel acts as the forward process in diffusion. To reduce bandwidth requirements, we incorporate a downsampling module and a paired upsampling module based on a variational auto-encoder with reparameterization at the receiver to ensure that the recovered features conform to the Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we derive the loss function for our proposed system and evaluate its performance through comprehensive experiments. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in pixel-level metrics such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and semantic metrics like learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). These enhancements are more profound regarding the compression rates and SNR compared to deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC). We release the code atthis https URL.

  Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions, our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.

  Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues, PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example, 2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across a range of scenes.

  Notable breakthroughs in unified understanding and generation modeling have led to remarkable advancements in image understanding, reasoning, production and editing, yet current foundational models predominantly focus on processing images, creating a gap in the development of unified models for video understanding and generation. This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.

  Recent advances in diffusion transformer models for motion-guided video generation, such as Tora, have shown significant progress. In this paper, we present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a critical advancement in multi-condition video generation.

- **[LongAnimation: Long Animation Generation with Dynamic Global-Local Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01945)**  `arXiv:2507.01945`  `cs.CV`

  Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore, automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation. Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color consistency for open-domain animation colorization task.

  Camera control has been actively studied in text or image conditioned video generation tasks. However, altering camera trajectories of a given video remains under-explored, despite its importance in the field of video creation. It is non-trivial due to the extra constraints of maintaining multiple-frame appearance and dynamic synchronization. To address this, we present ReCamMaster, a camera-controlled generative video re-rendering framework that reproduces the dynamic scene of an input video at novel camera trajectories. The core innovation lies in harnessing the generative capabilities of pre-trained text-to-video models through a simple yet powerful video conditioning mechanism--its capability is often overlooked in current research. To overcome the scarcity of qualified training data, we construct a comprehensive multi-camera synchronized video dataset using Unreal Engine 5, which is carefully curated to follow real-world filming characteristics, covering diverse scenes and camera movements. It helps the model generalize to in-the-wild videos. Lastly, we further improve the robustness to diverse inputs through a meticulously designed training strategy. Extensive experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our method also finds promising applications in video stabilization, super-resolution, and outpainting. Our code and dataset are publicly available at:this https URL.

- **[TIP-I2V: A Million-Scale Real Text and Image Prompt Dataset for Image-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04709)**  `arXiv:2411.04709`  `cs.CV`

  Video generation models are revolutionizing content creation, with image-to-video models drawing increasing attention due to their enhanced controllability, visual consistency, and practical applications. However, despite their popularity, these models rely on user-provided text and image prompts, and there is currently no dedicated dataset for studying these prompts. In this paper, we introduce TIP-I2V, the first large-scale dataset of over 1.70 million unique user-provided Text and Image Prompts specifically for Image-to-Video generation. Additionally, we provide the corresponding generated videos from five state-of-the-art image-to-video models. We begin by outlining the time-consuming and costly process of curating this large-scale dataset. Next, we compare TIP-I2V to two popular prompt datasets, VidProM (text-to-video) and DiffusionDB (text-to-image), highlighting differences in both basic and semantic information. This dataset enables advancements in image-to-video research. For instance, to develop better models, researchers can use the prompts in TIP-I2V to analyze user preferences and evaluate the multi-dimensional performance of their trained models; and to enhance model safety, they may focus on addressing the misinformation issue caused by image-to-video models. The new research inspired by TIP-I2V and the differences with existing datasets emphasize the importance of a specialized image-to-video prompt dataset. The project is available atthis https URL.
