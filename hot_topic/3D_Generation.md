  Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to 4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

  Controllable video generation remains a significant challenge, despite recent advances in generating high-quality and consistent videos. Most existing methods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting intricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control precision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video Generative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts, thus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts. Specifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle static and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change property to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables, enabling disentangled control of video generation. To establish the theoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in for GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves generation quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.

  Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes (storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images. We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training. Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible human-scene interaction from a single image scene.

  Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output. In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2) noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.

- **[Bind-Your-Avatar: Multi-Talking-Character Video Generation with Dynamic 3D-mask-based Embedding Router](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19833)**  `arXiv:2506.19833`  `cs.CV`

  Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in audio-driven talking head generation. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on single-character scenarios. While some methods can create separate conversation videos between two individuals, the critical challenge of generating unified conversation videos with multiple physically co-present characters sharing the same spatial environment remains largely unaddressed. This setting presents two key challenges: audio-to-character correspondence control and the lack of suitable datasets featuring multi-character talking videos within the same scene. To address these challenges, we introduce Bind-Your-Avatar, an MM-DiT-based model specifically designed for multi-talking-character video generation in the same scene. Specifically, we propose (1) A novel framework incorporating a fine-grained Embedding Router that binds `who' and `speak what' together to address the audio-to-character correspondence control. (2) Two methods for implementing a 3D-mask embedding router that enables frame-wise, fine-grained control of individual characters, with distinct loss functions based on observed geometric priors and a mask refinement strategy to enhance the accuracy and temporal smoothness of the predicted masks. (3) The first dataset, to the best of our knowledge, specifically constructed for multi-talking-character video generation, and accompanied by an open-source data processing pipeline, and (4) A benchmark for the dual-talking-characters video generation, with extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance over multiple state-of-the-art methods.

  Existing 4D synthesis methods primarily focus on object-level generation or dynamic scene synthesis with limited novel views, restricting their ability to generate multi-view consistent and immersive dynamic 4D scenes. To address these constraints, we propose a framework (dubbed as CoCo4D) for generating detailed dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts, with the option to include images. Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion typically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are less pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two responsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving background, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt and an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion sequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the synthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a novel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the moving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a parametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent blending. Extensive experiments show that CoCo4D achieves comparable or superior performance in 4D scene generation compared to existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

- **[Training-Free Motion Customization for Distilled Video Generators with Adaptive Test-Time Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19348)**  `arXiv:2506.19348`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jintao Rong, Xin Xie, Xinyi Yu, Linlin Ou, Xinyu Zhang, Chunhua Shen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Distilled video generation models offer fast and efficient synthesis but struggle with motion customization when guided by reference videos, especially under training-free settings. Existing training-free methods, originally designed for standard diffusion models, fail to generalize due to the accelerated generative process and large denoising steps in distilled models. To address this, we propose MotionEcho, a novel training-free test-time distillation framework that enables motion customization by leveraging diffusion teacher forcing. Our approach uses high-quality, slow teacher models to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation across timesteps according to guidance needs. Extensive experiments across various distilled video generation models and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion fidelity and generation quality while preserving high efficiency.

- **[PrITTI: Primitive-based Generation of Controllable and Editable 3D Semantic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19117)**  `arXiv:2506.19117`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large-scale 3D semantic scene generation has predominantly relied on voxel-based representations, which are memory-intensive, bound by fixed resolutions, and challenging to edit. In contrast, primitives represent semantic entities using compact, coarse 3D structures that are easy to manipulate and compose, making them an ideal representation for this task. In this paper, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion-based framework that leverages primitives as the main foundational elements for generating compositional, controllable, and editable 3D semantic scene layouts. Our method adopts a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in a rasterized format while encoding objects as vectorized 3D primitives. This decomposition is also reflected in a structured latent representation that enables flexible scene manipulation of ground and object components. To overcome the orientation ambiguities in conventional encoding methods, we introduce a stable Cholesky-based parameterization that jointly encodes object size and orientation. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that PrITTI outperforms a voxel-based baseline in generation quality, while reducing memory requirements by up to $3\times$. In addition, PrITTI enables direct instance-level manipulation of objects in the scene and supports a range of downstream applications, including scene inpainting, outpainting, and photo-realistic street-view synthesis.

  Anime video generation faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of anime data and unusual motion patterns, leading to issues such as motion distortion and flickering artifacts, which result in misalignment with human preferences. Existing reward models, designed primarily for real-world videos, fail to capture the unique appearance and consistency requirements of anime. In this work, we propose a pipeline to enhance anime video generation by leveraging human feedback for better alignment. Specifically, we construct the first multi-dimensional reward dataset for anime videos, comprising 30k human-annotated samples that incorporating human preferences for both visual appearance and visual consistency. Based on this, we develop AnimeReward, a powerful reward model that employs specialized vision-language models for different evaluation dimensions to guide preference alignment. Furthermore, we introduce Gap-Aware Preference Optimization (GAPO), a novel training method that explicitly incorporates preference gaps into the optimization process, enhancing alignment performance and efficiency. Extensive experiment results show that AnimeReward outperforms existing reward models, and the inclusion of GAPO leads to superior alignment in both quantitative benchmarks and human evaluations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing anime video quality. Our code and dataset are publicly available atthis https URL.

  We address the problem of game level repair, which consists of taking a designed but non-functional game level and making it functional. This might consist of ensuring the completeness of the level, reachability of objects, or other performance characteristics. The repair problem may also be constrained in that it can only make a small number of changes to the level. We investigate search-based solutions to the level repair problem, particularly using evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms, with good results. This level repair method is applied to levels generated using a machine learning-based procedural content generation (PCGML) method that generates stylistically appropriate but frequently broken levels. This combination of PCGML for generation and search-based methods for repair shows great promise as a hybrid procedural content generation (PCG) method.
