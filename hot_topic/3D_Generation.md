- **[LLM-based Realistic Safety-Critical Driving Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01264)**  `arXiv:2507.01264`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Designing diverse and safety-critical driving scenarios is essential for evaluating autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for few-shot code generation to automatically synthesize driving scenarios within the CARLA simulator, which has flexibility in scenario scripting, efficient code-based control of traffic participants, and enforcement of realistic physical dynamics. Given a few example prompts and code samples, the LLM generates safety-critical scenario scripts that specify the behavior and placement of traffic participants, with a particular focus on collision events. To bridge the gap between simulation and real-world appearance, we integrate a video generation pipeline using Cosmos-Transfer1 with ControlNet, which converts rendered scenes into realistic driving videos. Our approach enables controllable scenario generation and facilitates the creation of rare but critical edge cases, such as pedestrian crossings under occlusion or sudden vehicle cut-ins. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating a wide range of realistic, diverse, and safety-critical scenarios, offering a promising tool for simulation-based testing of autonomous vehicles.

  As the prediction horizon increases, predicting the future evolution of traffic scenes becomes increasingly difficult due to the multi-modal nature of agent motion. Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach.

- **[ConceptAttention: Diffusion Transformers Learn Highly Interpretable Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04320)**  `arXiv:2502.04320`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  Do the rich representations of multi-modal diffusion transformers (DiTs) exhibit unique properties that enhance their interpretability? We introduce ConceptAttention, a novel method that leverages the expressive power of DiT attention layers to generate high-quality saliency maps that precisely locate textual concepts within images. Without requiring additional training, ConceptAttention repurposes the parameters of DiT attention layers to produce highly contextualized concept embeddings, contributing the major discovery that performing linear projections in the output space of DiT attention layers yields significantly sharper saliency maps compared to commonly used cross-attention maps. ConceptAttention even achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot image segmentation benchmarks, outperforming 15 other zero-shot interpretability methods on the ImageNet-Segmentation dataset. ConceptAttention works for popular image models and even seamlessly generalizes to video generation. Our work contributes the first evidence that the representations of multi-modal DiTs are highly transferable to vision tasks like segmentation.

  Understanding and predicting the dynamics of the physical world can enhance a robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.

- **[Concat-ID: Towards Universal Identity-Preserving Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14151)**  `arXiv:2503.14151`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yong Zhong, Zhuoyi Yang, Jiayan Teng, Xiaotao Gu, Chongxuan Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Concat-ID, a unified framework for identity-preserving video generation. Concat-ID employs variational autoencoders to extract image features, which are then concatenated with video latents along the sequence dimension. It relies exclusively on inherent 3D self-attention mechanisms to incorporate them, eliminating the need for additional parameters or modules. A novel cross-video pairing strategy and a multi-stage training regimen are introduced to balance identity consistency and facial editability while enhancing video naturalness. Extensive experiments demonstrate Concat-ID's superiority over existing methods in both single and multi-identity generation, as well as its seamless scalability to multi-subject scenarios, including virtual try-on and background-controllable generation. Concat-ID establishes a new benchmark for identity-preserving video synthesis, providing a versatile and scalable solution for a wide range of applications.

- **[LongAnimation: Long Animation Generation with Dynamic Global-Local Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01945)**  `arXiv:2507.01945`  `cs.CV`

  Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore, automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation. Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color consistency for open-domain animation colorization task.

- **[AIGVE-MACS: Unified Multi-Aspect Commenting and Scoring Model for AI-Generated Video Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01255)**  `arXiv:2507.01255`  `cs.CV`

  The rapid advancement of AI-generated video models has created a pressing need for robust and interpretable evaluation frameworks. Existing metrics are limited to producing numerical scores without explanatory comments, resulting in low interpretability and human evaluation alignment. To address those challenges, we introduce AIGVE-MACS, a unified model for AI-Generated Video Evaluation(AIGVE), which can provide not only numerical scores but also multi-aspect language comment feedback in evaluating these generated videos. Central to our approach is AIGVE-BENCH 2, a large-scale benchmark comprising 2,500 AI-generated videos and 22,500 human-annotated detailed comments and numerical scores across nine critical evaluation aspects. Leveraging AIGVE-BENCH 2, AIGVE-MACS incorporates recent Vision-Language Models with a novel token-wise weighted loss and a dynamic frame sampling strategy to better align with human evaluators. Comprehensive experiments across supervised and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that AIGVE-MACS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both scoring correlation and comment quality, significantly outperforming prior baselines including GPT-4o and VideoScore. In addition, we further showcase a multi-agent refinement framework where feedback from AIGVE-MACS drives iterative improvements in video generation, leading to 53.5% quality enhancement. This work establishes a new paradigm for comprehensive, human-aligned evaluation of AI-generated videos. We release the AIGVE-BENCH 2 and AIGVE-MACS atthis https URL.

  Advances in AI generative models facilitate super-realistic video synthesis, amplifying misinformation risks via social media and eroding trust in digital content. Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.

- **[BizGen: Advancing Article-level Visual Text Rendering for Infographics Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20672)**  `arXiv:2503.20672`  `cs.CV`

  Recently, state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models, such as Flux and Ideogram 2.0, have made significant progress in sentence-level visual text rendering. In this paper, we focus on the more challenging scenarios of article-level visual text rendering and address a novel task of generating high-quality business content, including infographics and slides, based on user provided article-level descriptive prompts and ultra-dense layouts. The fundamental challenges are twofold: significantly longer context lengths and the scarcity of high-quality business content data.In contrast to most previous works that focus on a limited number of sub-regions and sentence-level prompts, ensuring precise adherence to ultra-dense layouts with tens or even hundreds of sub-regions in business content is far more challenging. We make two key technical contributions: (i) the construction of scalable, high-quality business content dataset, i.e., Infographics-650K, equipped with ultra-dense layouts and prompts by implementing a layer-wise retrieval-augmented infographic generation scheme; and (ii) a layout-guided cross attention scheme, which injects tens of region-wise prompts into a set of cropped region latent space according to the ultra-dense layouts, and refine each sub-regions flexibly during inference using a layout conditional CFG.We demonstrate the strong results of our system compared to previous SOTA systems such as Flux and SD3 on our BizEval prompt set. Additionally, we conduct thorough ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of each component. We hope our constructed Infographics-650K and BizEval can encourage the broader community to advance the progress of business content generation.

  The remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) in content generation, coding, and common-sense reasoning has spurred widespread integration into many facets of society. However, integration of LLMs raises valid questions on their reliability and trustworthiness, given their propensity to generate hallucinations: plausible, factually-incorrect responses, which are expressed with striking confidence. Previous work has shown that hallucinations and other non-factual responses generated by LLMs can be detected by examining the uncertainty of the LLM in its response to the pertinent prompt, driving significant research efforts devoted to quantifying the uncertainty of LLMs. This survey seeks to provide an extensive review of existing uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs, identifying their salient features, along with their strengths and weaknesses. We present existing methods within a relevant taxonomy, unifying ostensibly disparate methods to aid understanding of the state of the art. Furthermore, we highlight applications of uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs, spanning chatbot and textual applications to embodied artificial intelligence applications in robotics. We conclude with open research challenges in uncertainty quantification of LLMs, seeking to motivate future research.
