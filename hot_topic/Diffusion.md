- **[Prior Does Matter: Visual Navigation via Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10041)**  `arXiv:2504.10041`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`  
  _Hao Ren, Yiming Zeng, Zetong Bi, Zhaoliang Wan, Junlong Huang, Hui Cheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in diffusion-based imitation learning, which show impressive performance in modeling multimodal distributions and training stability, have led to substantial progress in various robot learning tasks. In visual navigation, previous diffusion-based policies typically generate action sequences by initiating from denoising Gaussian noise. However, the target action distribution often diverges significantly from Gaussian noise, leading to redundant denoising steps and increased learning complexity. Additionally, the sparsity of effective action distributions makes it challenging for the policy to generate accurate actions without guidance. To address these issues, we propose a novel, unified visual navigation framework leveraging the denoising diffusion bridge models named NaviBridger. This approach enables action generation by initiating from any informative prior actions, enhancing guidance and efficiency in the denoising process. We explore how diffusion bridges can enhance imitation learning in visual navigation tasks and further examine three source policies for generating prior actions. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios demonstrate that NaviBridger accelerates policy inference and outperforms the baselines in generating target action sequences.

  Visual navigation, a fundamental challenge in mobile robotics, demands versatile policies to handle diverse environments. Classical methods leverage geometric solutions to minimize specific costs, offering adaptability to new scenarios but are prone to system errors due to their multi-modular design and reliance on hand-crafted rules. Learning-based methods, while achieving high planning success rates, face difficulties in generalizing to unseen environments beyond the training data and often require extensive training. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of learning-based methods and classical approaches for RGB-only visual navigation. Our method first trains a conditional diffusion model on diverse path-RGB observation pairs. During inference, it integrates the gradients of differentiable scene-specific and task-level costs, guiding the diffusion model to generate valid paths that meet the constraints. This approach alleviates the need for retraining, offering a plug-and-play solution. Extensive experiments in both indoor and outdoor settings, across simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrate zero-shot transfer capability of our approach, achieving higher success rates and fewer collisions compared to baseline methods. Code will be released atthis https URL.

- **[Efficient Task-specific Conditional Diffusion Policies: Shortcut Model Acceleration and SO(3) Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09927)**  `arXiv:2504.09927`  `cs.RO`  
  _Haiyong Yu, Yanqiong Jin, Yonghao He, Wei Sui_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imitation learning, particularly Diffusion Policies based methods, has recently gained significant traction in embodied AI as a powerful approach to action policy generation. These models efficiently generate action policies by learning to predict noise. However, conventional Diffusion Policy methods rely on iterative denoising, leading to inefficient inference and slow response times, which hinder real-time robot control. To address these limitations, we propose a Classifier-Free Shortcut Diffusion Policy (CF-SDP) that integrates classifier-free guidance with shortcut-based acceleration, enabling efficient task-specific action generation while significantly improving inference speed. Furthermore, we extend diffusion modeling to the SO(3) manifold in shortcut model, defining the forward and reverse processes in its tangent space with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. This ensures stable and accurate rotational estimation, enhancing the effectiveness of diffusion-based control. Our approach achieves nearly 5x acceleration in diffusion inference compared to DDIM-based Diffusion Policy while maintaining task performance. Evaluations both on the RoboTwin simulation platform and real-world scenarios across various tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method.

- **[REALM: Real-Time Estimates of Assistance for Learned Models in Human-Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09243)**  `arXiv:2504.09243`  `cs.RO`  
  _Michael Hagenow, Julie A. Shah_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There are a variety of mechanisms (i.e., input types) for real-time human interaction that can facilitate effective human-robot teaming. For example, previous works have shown how teleoperation, corrective, and discrete (i.e., preference over a small number of choices) input can enable robots to complete complex tasks. However, few previous works have looked at combining different methods, and in particular, opportunities for a robot to estimate and elicit the most effective form of assistance given its understanding of a task. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the value of different human assistance mechanisms based on the action uncertainty of a robot policy. Our key idea is to construct mathematical expressions for the expected post-interaction differential entropy (i.e., uncertainty) of a stochastic robot policy to compare the expected value of different interactions. As each type of human input imposes a different requirement for human involvement, we demonstrate how differential entropy estimates can be combined with a likelihood penalization approach to effectively balance feedback informational needs with the level of required input. We demonstrate evidence of how our approach interfaces with emergent learning models (e.g., a diffusion model) to produce accurate assistance value estimates through both simulation and a robot user study. Our user study results indicate that the proposed approach can enable task completion with minimal human feedback for uncertain robot behaviors.

- **[Diffusion-Based Approximate MPC: Fast and Consistent Imitation of Multi-Modal Action Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04603)**  `arXiv:2504.04603`  `cs.RO`  
  _Pau Marquez Julbe, Julian Nubert, Henrik Hose, Sebastian Trimpe, Katherine J. Kuchenbecker_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Approximating model predictive control (MPC) using imitation learning (IL) allows for fast control without solving expensive optimization problems online. However, methods that use neural networks in a simple L2-regression setup fail to approximate multi-modal (set-valued) solution distributions caused by local optima found by the numerical solver or non-convex constraints, such as obstacles, significantly limiting the applicability of approximate MPC in practice. We solve this issue by using diffusion models to accurately represent the complete solution distribution (i.e., all modes) at high control rates (more than 1000 Hz). This work shows that diffusion based AMPC significantly outperforms L2-regression-based approximate MPC for multi-modal action distributions. In contrast to most earlier work on IL, we also focus on running the diffusion-based controller at a higher rate and in joint space instead of end-effector space. Additionally, we propose the use of gradient guidance during the denoising process to consistently pick the same mode in closed loop to prevent switching between solutions. We propose using the cost and constraint satisfaction of the original MPC problem during parallel sampling of solutions from the diffusion model to pick a better mode online. We evaluate our method on the fast and accurate control of a 7-DoF robot manipulator both in simulation and on hardware deployed at 250 Hz, achieving a speedup of more than 70 times compared to solving the MPC problem online and also outperforming the numerical optimization (used for training) in success ratio.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inferring object motion representations from observations enhances the performance of robotic manipulation tasks. This paper introduces a new paradigm for robot imitation learning that generates action sequences by reasoning about object motion from visual observations. We propose MBA (Motion Before Action), a novel module that employs two cascaded diffusion processes for object motion generation and robot action generation under object motion guidance. MBA first predicts the future pose sequence of the object based on observations, then uses this sequence as a condition to guide robot action generation. Designed as a plug-and-play component, MBA can be flexibly integrated into existing robotic manipulation policies with diffusion action heads. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the performance of existing policies across a wide range of manipulation tasks.

- **[Efficient Generative Model Training via Embedded Representation Warmup](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10188)**  `arXiv:2504.10188`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  Diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional data but fall short in training efficiency and representation quality compared to self-supervised methods. We identify a key bottleneck: the underutilization of high-quality, semantically rich representations during training notably slows down convergence. Our systematic analysis reveals a critical representation processing region -- primarily in the early layers -- where semantic and structural pattern learning takes place before generation can occur. To address this, we propose Embedded Representation Warmup (ERW), a plug-and-play framework where in the first stage we get the ERW module serves as a warmup that initializes the early layers of the diffusion model with high-quality, pretrained representations. This warmup minimizes the burden of learning representations from scratch, thereby accelerating convergence and boosting performance. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that ERW's efficacy depends on its precise integration into specific neural network layers -- termed the representation processing region -- where the model primarily processes and transforms feature representations for later generation. We further establish that ERW not only accelerates training convergence but also enhances representation quality: empirically, our method achieves a 40$\times$ acceleration in training speed compared to REPA, the current state-of-the-art methods.

- **[Bundle Neural Networks for message diffusion on graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15540)**  `arXiv:2405.15540`  `cs.LG`  
  _Jacob Bamberger, Federico Barbero, Xiaowen Dong, Michael M. Bronstein_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The dominant paradigm for learning on graph-structured data is message passing. Despite being a strong inductive bias, the local message passing mechanism suffers from pathological issues such as over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited node-level expressivity. To address these limitations we propose Bundle Neural Networks (BuNN), a new type of GNN that operates via message diffusion over flat vector bundles - structures analogous to connections on Riemannian manifolds that augment the graph by assigning to each node a vector space and an orthogonal map. A BuNN layer evolves the features according to a diffusion-type partial differential equation. When discretized, BuNNs are a special case of Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs), a recently proposed MPNN capable of mitigating over-smoothing. The continuous nature of message diffusion enables BuNNs to operate on larger scales of the graph and, therefore, to mitigate over-squashing. Finally, we prove that BuNN can approximate any feature transformation over nodes on any (potentially infinite) family of graphs given injective positional encodings, resulting in universal node-level expressivity. We support our theory via synthetic experiments and showcase the strong empirical performance of BuNNs over a range of real-world tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on several standard benchmarks in transductive and inductive settings.

- **[MonoDiff9D: Monocular Category-Level 9D Object Pose Estimation via Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10433)**  `arXiv:2504.10433`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Jian Liu, Wei Sun, Hui Yang, Jin Zheng, Zichen Geng, Hossein Rahmani, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object pose estimation is a core means for robots to understand and interact with their environment. For this task, monocular category-level methods are attractive as they require only a single RGB camera. However, current methods rely on shape priors or CAD models of the intra-class known objects. We propose a diffusion-based monocular category-level 9D object pose generation method, MonoDiff9D. Our motivation is to leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models to alleviate the need for shape priors, CAD models, or depth sensors for intra-class unknown object pose estimation. We first estimate coarse depth via DINOv2 from the monocular image in a zero-shot manner and convert it into a point cloud. We then fuse the global features of the point cloud with the input image and use the fused features along with the encoded time step to condition MonoDiff9D. Finally, we design a transformer-based denoiser to recover the object pose from Gaussian noise. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmark datasets show that MonoDiff9D achieves state-of-the-art monocular category-level 9D object pose estimation accuracy without the need for shape priors or CAD models at any stage.

- **[REPA-E: Unlocking VAE for End-to-End Tuning with Latent Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10483)**  `arXiv:2504.10483`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Xingjian Leng, Jaskirat Singh, Yunzhong Hou, Zhenchang Xing, Saining Xie, Liang Zheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper we tackle a fundamental question: "Can we train latent diffusion models together with the variational auto-encoder (VAE) tokenizer in an end-to-end manner?" Traditional deep-learning wisdom dictates that end-to-end training is often preferable when possible. However, for latent diffusion transformers, it is observed that end-to-end training both VAE and diffusion-model using standard diffusion-loss is ineffective, even causing a degradation in final performance. We show that while diffusion loss is ineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the representation-alignment (REPA) loss -- allowing both VAE and diffusion model to be jointly tuned during the training process. Despite its simplicity, the proposed training recipe (REPA-E) shows remarkable performance; speeding up diffusion model training by over 17x and 45x over REPA and vanilla training recipes, respectively. Interestingly, we observe that end-to-end tuning with REPA-E also improves the VAE itself; leading to improved latent space structure and downstream generation performance. In terms of final performance, our approach sets a new state-of-the-art; achieving FID of 1.26 and 1.83 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256 x 256.

- **[Investigating the Role of Bilateral Symmetry for Inpainting Brain MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10039)**  `arXiv:2504.10039`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inpainting has recently emerged as a valuable and interesting technology to employ in the analysis of medical imaging data, in particular brain MRI. A wide variety of methodologies for inpainting MRI have been proposed and demonstrated on tasks including anomaly detection. In this work we investigate the statistical relationship between inpainted brain structures and the amount of subject-specific conditioning information, i.e. the other areas of the image that are masked. In particular, we analyse the distribution of inpainting results when masking additional regions of the image, specifically the contra-lateral structure. This allows us to elucidate where in the brain the model is drawing information from, and in particular, what is the importance of hemispherical symmetry? Our experiments interrogate a diffusion inpainting model through analysing the inpainting of subcortical brain structures based on intensity and estimated area change. We demonstrate that some structures show a strong influence of symmetry in the conditioning of the inpainting process.

  Modern machine learning models for scene understanding, such as depth estimation and object tracking, rely on large, high-quality datasets that mimic real-world deployment scenarios. To address data scarcity, we propose an end-to-end system for synthetic data generation for scalable, high-quality, and customizable 3D indoor scenes. By integrating and adapting text-to-image and multi-view diffusion models with Neural Radiance Field-based meshing, this system generates highfidelity 3D object assets from text prompts and incorporates them into pre-defined floor plans using a rendering tool. By introducing novel loss functions and training strategies into existing methods, the system supports on-demand scene generation, aiming to alleviate the scarcity of current available data, generally manually crafted by artists. This system advances the role of synthetic data in addressing machine learning training limitations, enabling more robust and generalizable models for real-world applications.

- **[MedIL: Implicit Latent Spaces for Generating Heterogeneous Medical Images at Arbitrary Resolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09322)**  `arXiv:2504.09322`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Tyler Spears, Shen Zhu, Yinzhu Jin, Aman Shrivastava, P. Thomas Fletcher_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we introduce MedIL, a first-of-its-kind autoencoder built for encoding medical images with heterogeneous sizes and resolutions for image generation. Medical images are often large and heterogeneous, where fine details are of vital clinical importance. Image properties change drastically when considering acquisition equipment, patient demographics, and pathology, making realistic medical image generation challenging. Recent work in latent diffusion models (LDMs) has shown success in generating images resampled to a fixed-size. However, this is a narrow subset of the resolutions native to image acquisition, and resampling discards fine anatomical details. MedIL utilizes implicit neural representations to treat images as continuous signals, where encoding and decoding can be performed at arbitrary resolutions without prior resampling. We quantitatively and qualitatively show how MedIL compresses and preserves clinically-relevant features over large multi-site, multi-resolution datasets of both T1w brain MRIs and lung CTs. We further demonstrate how MedIL can influence the quality of images generated with a diffusion model, and discuss how MedIL can enhance generative models to resemble raw clinical acquisitions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Navigation is a fundamental skill of agents with visual-motor capabilities. We introduce a Navigation World Model (NWM), a controllable video generation model that predicts future visual observations based on past observations and navigation actions. To capture complex environment dynamics, NWM employs a Conditional Diffusion Transformer (CDiT), trained on a diverse collection of egocentric videos of both human and robotic agents, and scaled up to 1 billion parameters. In familiar environments, NWM can plan navigation trajectories by simulating them and evaluating whether they achieve the desired goal. Unlike supervised navigation policies with fixed behavior, NWM can dynamically incorporate constraints during planning. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in planning trajectories from scratch or by ranking trajectories sampled from an external policy. Furthermore, NWM leverages its learned visual priors to imagine trajectories in unfamiliar environments from a single input image, making it a flexible and powerful tool for next-generation navigation systems.

- **[Sculpting Memory: Multi-Concept Forgetting in Diffusion Models via Dynamic Mask and Concept-Aware Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09039)**  `arXiv:2504.09039`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Gen Li, Yang Xiao, Jie Ji, Kaiyuan Deng, Bo Hui, Linke Guo, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts. However, their ability to store vast amounts of knowledge raises concerns in scenarios where selective forgetting is necessary, such as removing copyrighted content, reducing biases, or eliminating harmful concepts. While existing unlearning methods can remove certain concepts, they struggle with multi-concept forgetting due to instability, residual knowledge persistence, and generation quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Dynamic Mask coupled with Concept-Aware Loss}, a novel unlearning framework designed for multi-concept forgetting in diffusion models. Our \textbf{Dynamic Mask} mechanism adaptively updates gradient masks based on current optimization states, allowing selective weight modifications that prevent interference with unrelated knowledge. Additionally, our \textbf{Concept-Aware Loss} explicitly guides the unlearning process by enforcing semantic consistency through superclass alignment, while a regularization loss based on knowledge distillation ensures that previously unlearned concepts remain forgotten during sequential unlearning. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our approach. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unlearning techniques in forgetting effectiveness, output fidelity, and semantic coherence, particularly in multi-concept scenarios. Our work provides a principled and flexible framework for stable and high-fidelity unlearning in generative models. The code will be released publicly.

  In the medical field, the limited availability of large-scale datasets and labor-intensive annotation processes hinder the performance of deep models. Diffusion-based generative augmentation approaches present a promising solution to this issue, having been proven effective in advancing downstream medical recognition tasks. Nevertheless, existing works lack sufficient semantic and sequential steerability for challenging video/3D sequence generation, and neglect quality control of noisy synthesized samples, resulting in unreliable synthetic databases and severely limiting the performance of downstream tasks. In this work, we present Ctrl-GenAug, a novel and general generative augmentation framework that enables highly semantic- and sequential-customized sequence synthesis and suppresses incorrectly synthesized samples, to aid medical sequence classification. Specifically, we first design a multimodal conditions-guided sequence generator for controllably synthesizing diagnosis-promotive samples. A sequential augmentation module is integrated to enhance the temporal/stereoscopic coherence of generated samples. Then, we propose a noisy synthetic data filter to suppress unreliable cases at semantic and sequential levels. Extensive experiments on 3 medical datasets, using 11 networks trained on 3 paradigms, comprehensively analyze the effectiveness and generality of Ctrl-GenAug, particularly in underrepresented high-risk populations and out-domain conditions.

- **[Curriculum Direct Preference Optimization for Diffusion and Consistency Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13637)**  `arXiv:2405.13637`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Florinel-Alin Croitoru, Vlad Hondru, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Nicu Sebe, Mubarak Shah_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

- **[EquiVDM: Equivariant Video Diffusion Models with Temporally Consistent Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09789)**  `arXiv:2504.09789`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Chao Liu, Arash Vahdat_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Temporally consistent video-to-video generation is essential for applications of video diffusion models in areas such as sim-to-real, style-transfer, video upsampling, etc. In this paper, we propose a video diffusion framework that leverages temporally consistent noise to generate coherent video frames without specialized modules or additional constraints. We show that the standard training objective of diffusion models, when applied with temporally consistent noise, encourages the model to be equivariant to spatial transformations in input video and noise. This enables our model to better follow motion patterns from the input video, producing aligned motion and high-fidelity frames. Furthermore, we extend our approach to 3D-consistent video generation by attaching noise as textures on 3D meshes, ensuring 3D consistency in sim-to-real applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in motion alignment, 3D consistency, and video quality while requiring only a few sampling steps in practice.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Generalizable Gaussian Splatting have enabled robust 3D reconstruction from sparse input views by utilizing feed-forward Gaussian Splatting models, achieving superior cross-scene generalization. However, while many methods focus on geometric consistency, they often neglect the potential of text-driven guidance to enhance semantic understanding, which is crucial for accurately reconstructing fine-grained details in complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose TextSplat--the first text-driven Generalizable Gaussian Splatting framework. By employing a text-guided fusion of diverse semantic cues, our framework learns robust cross-modal feature representations that improve the alignment of geometric and semantic information, producing high-fidelity 3D reconstructions. Specifically, our framework employs three parallel modules to obtain complementary representations: the Diffusion Prior Depth Estimator for accurate depth information, the Semantic Aware Segmentation Network for detailed semantic information, and the Multi-View Interaction Network for refined cross-view features. Then, in the Text-Guided Semantic Fusion Module, these representations are integrated via the text-guided and attention-based feature aggregation mechanism, resulting in enhanced 3D Gaussian parameters enriched with detailed semantic cues. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework. The code will be publicly available.

  Controllable scene generation could reduce the cost of diverse data collection substantially for autonomous driving. Prior works formulate the traffic layout generation as predictive progress, either by denoising entire sequences at once or by iteratively predicting the next frame. However, full sequence denoising hinders online reaction, while the latter's short-sighted next-frame prediction lacks precise goal-state guidance. Further, the learned model struggles to generate complex or challenging scenarios due to a large number of safe and ordinal driving behaviors from open datasets. To overcome these, we introduce Nexus, a decoupled scene generation framework that improves reactivity and goal conditioning by simulating both ordinal and challenging scenarios from fine-grained tokens with independent noise states. At the core of the decoupled pipeline is the integration of a partial noise-masking training strategy and a noise-aware schedule that ensures timely environmental updates throughout the denoising process. To complement challenging scenario generation, we collect a dataset consisting of complex corner cases. It covers 540 hours of simulated data, including high-risk interactions such as cut-in, sudden braking, and collision. Nexus achieves superior generation realism while preserving reactivity and goal orientation, with a 40% reduction in displacement error. We further demonstrate that Nexus improves closed-loop planning by 20% through data augmentation and showcase its capability in safety-critical data generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image generation has seen groundbreaking advancements with diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity synthesis and precise image editing through cross-attention manipulation. Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have re-emerged as powerful alternatives, leveraging next-token generation to match diffusion models. However, existing editing techniques designed for diffusion models fail to translate directly to AR models due to fundamental differences in structural control. Specifically, AR models suffer from spatial poverty of attention maps and sequential accumulation of structural errors during image editing, which disrupt object layouts and global consistency. In this work, we introduce Implicit Structure Locking (ISLock), the first training-free editing strategy for AR visual models. Rather than relying on explicit attention manipulation or fine-tuning, ISLock preserves structural blueprints by dynamically aligning self-attention patterns with reference images through the Anchor Token Matching (ATM) protocol. By implicitly enforcing structural consistency in latent space, our method ISLock enables structure-aware editing while maintaining generative autonomy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ISLock achieves high-quality, structure-consistent edits without additional training and is superior or comparable to conventional editing techniques. Our findings pioneer the way for efficient and flexible AR-based image editing, further bridging the performance gap between diffusion and autoregressive generative models.

- **[LL-Gaussian: Low-Light Scene Reconstruction and Enhancement via Gaussian Splatting for Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10331)**  `arXiv:2504.10331`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hao Sun, Fenggen Yu, Huiyao Xu, Tao Zhang, Changqing Zou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Novel view synthesis (NVS) in low-light scenes remains a significant challenge due to degraded inputs characterized by severe noise, low dynamic range (LDR) and unreliable initialization. While recent NeRF-based approaches have shown promising results, most suffer from high computational costs, and some rely on carefully captured or pre-processed data--such as RAW sensor inputs or multi-exposure sequences--which severely limits their practicality. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with competitive visual fidelity; however, existing 3DGS-based methods struggle with low-light sRGB inputs, resulting in unstable Gaussian initialization and ineffective noise suppression. To address these challenges, we propose LL-Gaussian, a novel framework for 3D reconstruction and enhancement from low-light sRGB images, enabling pseudo normal-light novel view synthesis. Our method introduces three key innovations: 1) an end-to-end Low-Light Gaussian Initialization Module (LLGIM) that leverages dense priors from learning-based MVS approach to generate high-quality initial point clouds; 2) a dual-branch Gaussian decomposition model that disentangles intrinsic scene properties (reflectance and illumination) from transient interference, enabling stable and interpretable optimization; 3) an unsupervised optimization strategy guided by both physical constrains and diffusion prior to jointly steer decomposition and enhancement. Additionally, we contribute a challenging dataset collected in extreme low-light environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of LL-Gaussian. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, LL-Gaussian achieves up to 2,000 times faster inference and reduces training time to just 2%, while delivering superior reconstruction and rendering quality.

  We conduct an in-depth analysis of attention in video diffusion transformers (VDiTs) and report a number of novel findings. We identify three key properties of attention in VDiTs: Structure, Sparsity, and Sinks. Structure: We observe that attention patterns across different VDiTs exhibit similar structure across different prompts, and that we can make use of the similarity of attention patterns to unlock video editing via self-attention map transfer. Sparse: We study attention sparsity in VDiTs, finding that proposed sparsity methods do not work for all VDiTs, because some layers that are seemingly sparse cannot be sparsified. Sinks: We make the first study of attention sinks in VDiTs, comparing and contrasting them to attention sinks in language models. We propose a number of future directions that can make use of our insights to improve the efficiency-quality Pareto frontier for VDiTs.

  Moving object detection (MOD) in remote sensing is significantly challenged by low resolution, extremely small object sizes, and complex noise interference. Current deep learning-based MOD methods rely on probability density estimation, which restricts flexible information interaction between objects and across temporal frames. To flexibly capture high-order inter-object and temporal relationships, we propose a point-based MOD in remote sensing. Inspired by diffusion models, the network optimization is formulated as a progressive denoising process that iteratively recovers moving object centers from sparse noisy points. Specifically, we sample scattered features from the backbone outputs as atomic units for subsequent processing, while global feature embeddings are aggregated to compensate for the limited coverage of sparse point features. By modeling spatial relative positions and semantic affinities, Spatial Relation Aggregation Attention is designed to enable high-order interactions among point-level features for enhanced object representation. To enhance temporal consistency, the Temporal Propagation and Global Fusion module is designed, which leverages an implicit memory reasoning mechanism for robust cross-frame feature integration. To align with the progressive denoising process, we propose a progressive MinK optimal transport assignment strategy that establishes specialized learning objectives at each denoising level. Additionally, we introduce a missing loss function to counteract the clustering tendency of denoised points around salient objects. Experiments on the RsData remote sensing MOD dataset show that our MOD method based on scattered point denoising can more effectively explore potential relationships between sparse moving objects and improve the detection capability and temporal consistency.

  Text-to-image (T2I) generation models often struggle with multi-instance synthesis (MIS), where they must accurately depict multiple distinct instances in a single image based on complex prompts detailing individual features. Traditional MIS control methods for UNet architectures like SD v1.5/SDXL fail to adapt to DiT-based models like FLUX and SD v3.5, which rely on integrated attention between image and text tokens rather than text-image cross-attention. To enhance MIS in DiT, we first analyze the mixed attention mechanism in DiT. Our token-wise and layer-wise analysis of attention maps reveals a hierarchical response structure: instance tokens dominate early layers, background tokens in middle layers, and attribute tokens in later layers. Building on this observation, we propose a training-free approach for enhancing MIS in DiT-based models with hierarchical and step-layer-wise attention specialty tuning (AST). AST amplifies key regions while suppressing irrelevant areas in distinct attention maps across layers and steps, guided by the hierarchical structure. This optimizes multimodal interactions by hierarchically decoupling the complex prompts with instance-based sketches. We evaluate our approach using upgraded sketch-based layouts for the T2I-CompBench and customized complex scenes. Both quantitative and qualitative results confirm our method enhances complex layout generation, ensuring precise instance placement and attribute representation in MIS.

  Single-image 3D scene reconstruction presents significant challenges due to its inherently ill-posed nature and limited input constraints. Recent advances have explored two promising directions: multiview generative models that train on 3D consistent datasets but struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, and 3D scene inpainting and completion frameworks that suffer from cross-view inconsistency and suboptimal error handling, as they depend exclusively on depth data or 3D smoothness, which ultimately degrades output quality and computational performance. Building upon these approaches, we present GaussVideoDreamer, which advances generative multimedia approaches by bridging the gap between image, video, and 3D generation, integrating their strengths through two key innovations: (1) A progressive video inpainting strategy that harnesses temporal coherence for improved multiview consistency and faster convergence. (2) A 3D Gaussian Splatting consistency mask to guide the video diffusion with 3D consistent multiview evidence. Our pipeline combines three core components: a geometry-aware initialization protocol, Inconsistency-Aware Gaussian Splatting, and a progressive video inpainting strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves 32% higher LLaVA-IQA scores and at least 2x speedup compared to existing methods while maintaining robust performance across diverse scenes.

  Due to the disparity between real-world degradations in user-generated content(UGC) images and synthetic degradations, traditional super-resolution methods struggle to generalize effectively, necessitating a more robust approach to model real-world distortions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to UGC image super-resolution by integrating semantic guidance into a diffusion framework. Our method addresses the inconsistency between degradations in wild and synthetic datasets by separately simulating the degradation processes on the LSDIR dataset and combining them with the official paired training set. Furthermore, we enhance degradation removal and detail generation by incorporating a pretrained semantic extraction model (SAM2) and fine-tuning key hyperparameters for improved perceptual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the proposed model won second place in the CVPR NTIRE 2025 Short-form UGC Image Super-Resolution Challenge, further validating its effectiveness.

  Generating video from various conditions, such as text, image, and audio, enables both spatial and temporal control, leading to high-quality generation results. Videos with dramatic motions often require a higher frame rate to ensure smooth motion. Currently, most audio-to-visual animation models use uniformly sampled frames from video clips. However, these uniformly sampled frames fail to capture significant key moments in dramatic motions at low frame rates and require significantly more memory when increasing the number of frames directly. In this paper, we propose KeyVID, a keyframe-aware audio-to-visual animation framework that significantly improves the generation quality for key moments in audio signals while maintaining computation efficiency. Given an image and an audio input, we first localize keyframe time steps from the audio. Then, we use a keyframe generator to generate the corresponding visual keyframes. Finally, we generate all intermediate frames using the motion interpolator. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that KeyVID significantly improves audio-video synchronization and video quality across multiple datasets, particularly for highly dynamic motions.

  Training diffusion models (DMs) requires substantial computational resources due to multiple forward and backward passes across numerous timesteps, motivating research into efficient training techniques. In this paper, we propose EB-Diff-Train, a new efficient DM training approach that is orthogonal to other methods of accelerating DM training, by investigating and leveraging Early-Bird (EB) tickets -- sparse subnetworks that manifest early in the training process and maintain high generation quality.We first investigate the existence of traditional EB tickets in DMs, enabling competitive generation quality without fully training a dense model.Then, we delve into the concept of diffusion-dedicated EB tickets, drawing on insights from varying importance of different timestep regions. These tickets adapt their sparsity levels according to the importance of corresponding timestep regions, allowing for aggressive sparsity during non-critical regions while conserving computational resources for crucial timestep regions.Building on this, we develop an efficient DM training technique that derives timestep-aware EB tickets, trains them in parallel, and combines them during inference for image generation. Extensive experiments validate the existence of both traditional and timestep-aware EB tickets, as well as the effectiveness of our proposed EB-Diff-Train method. This approach can significantly reduce training time both spatially and temporally -- achieving 2.9$\times$ to 5.8$\times$ speedups over training unpruned dense models, and up to 10.3$\times$ faster training compared to standard train-prune-finetune pipelines -- without compromising generative quality.Our code is available atthis https URL.

  The oracle bone inscription (OBI) recognition plays a significant role in understanding the history and culture of ancient China. However, the existing OBI datasets suffer from a long-tail distribution problem, leading to biased performance of OBI recognition models across majority and minority classes. With recent advancements in generative models, OBI synthesis-based data augmentation has become a promising avenue to expand the sample size of minority classes. Unfortunately, current OBI datasets lack large-scale structure-aligned image pairs for generative model training. To address these problems, we first present the Oracle-P15K, a structure-aligned OBI dataset for OBI generation and denoising, consisting of 14,542 images infused with domain knowledge from OBI experts. Second, we propose a diffusion model-based pseudo OBI generator, called OBIDiff, to achieve realistic and controllable OBI generation. Given a clean glyph image and a target rubbing-style image, it can effectively transfer the noise style of the original rubbing to the glyph image. Extensive experiments on OBI downstream tasks and user preference studies show the effectiveness of the proposed Oracle-P15K dataset and demonstrate that OBIDiff can accurately preserve inherent glyph structures while transferring authentic rubbing styles effectively.

  Aerial-Ground Person Re-IDentification (AG-ReID) aims to retrieve specific persons across cameras with different viewpoints. Previous works focus on designing discriminative ReID models to maintain identity consistency despite drastic changes in camera viewpoints. The core idea behind these methods is quite natural, but designing a view-robust network is a very challenging task. Moreover, they overlook the contribution of view-specific features in enhancing the model's capability to represent persons. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage feature learning framework named SD-ReID for AG-ReID, which takes advantage of the powerful understanding capacity of generative models, e.g., Stable Diffusion (SD), to generate view-specific features between different viewpoints. In the first stage, we train a simple ViT-based model to extract coarse-grained representations and controllable conditions. Then, in the second stage, we fine-tune the SD model to learn complementary representations guided by the controllable conditions. Furthermore, we propose the View-Refine Decoder (VRD) to obtain additional controllable conditions to generate missing cross-view features. Finally, we use the coarse-grained representations and all-view features generated by SD to retrieve target persons. Extensive experiments on the AG-ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SD-ReID. The source code will be available upon acceptance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models have produced excellent results in the field of conditional image generation. However, restoration of ancient murals, as an important downstream task in this field, poses significant challenges to diffusion model-based restoration methods due to its large defective area and scarce training samples. Conditional restoration tasks are more concerned with whether the restored part meets the aesthetic standards of mural restoration in terms of overall style and seam detail, and such metrics for evaluating heuristic image complements are lacking in current research. We therefore propose DiffuMural, a combined Multi-scale convergence and Collaborative Diffusion mechanism with ControlNet and cyclic consistency loss to optimise the matching between the generated images and the conditional control. DiffuMural demonstrates outstanding capabilities in mural restoration, leveraging training data from 23 large-scale Dunhuang murals that exhibit consistent visual aesthetics. The model excels in restoring intricate details, achieving a coherent overall appearance, and addressing the unique challenges posed by incomplete murals lacking factual grounding. Our evaluation framework incorporates four key metrics to quantitatively assess incomplete murals: factual accuracy, textural detail, contextual semantics, and holistic visual coherence. Furthermore, we integrate humanistic value assessments to ensure the restored murals retain their cultural and artistic significance. Extensive experiments validate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

  We introduce CamMimic, an innovative algorithm tailored for dynamic video editing needs. It is designed to seamlessly transfer the camera motion observed in a given reference video onto any scene of the user's choice in a zero-shot manner without requiring any additional data. Our algorithm achieves this using a two-phase strategy by leveraging a text-to-video diffusion model. In the first phase, we develop a multi-concept learning method using a combination of LoRA layers and an orthogonality loss to capture and understand the underlying spatial-temporal characteristics of the reference video as well as the spatial features of the user's desired scene. The second phase proposes a unique homography-based refinement strategy to enhance the temporal and spatial alignment of the generated video. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through experiments conducted on a dataset containing combinations of diverse scenes and reference videos containing a variety of camera motions. In the absence of an established metric for assessing camera motion transfer between unrelated scenes, we propose CameraScore, a novel metric that utilizes homography representations to measure camera motion similarity between the reference and generated videos. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach generates high-quality, motion-enhanced videos. Additionally, a user study reveals that 70.31% of participants preferred our method for scene preservation, while 90.45% favored it for motion transfer. We hope this work lays the foundation for future advancements in camera motion transfer across different scenes.

  Diffusion models are widely recognized for their ability to generate high-fidelity images. Despite the excellent performance and scalability of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, it applies fixed compression across different image regions during the diffusion process, disregarding the naturally varying information densities present in these regions. However, large compression leads to limited local realism, while small compression increases computational complexity and compromises global consistency, ultimately impacting the quality of generated images. To address these limitations, we propose dynamically compressing different image regions by recognizing the importance of different regions, and introduce a novel two-stage framework designed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of image generation: (1) Dynamic VAE (DVAE) at first stage employs a hierarchical encoder to encode different image regions at different downsampling rates, tailored to their specific information densities, thereby providing more accurate and natural latent codes for the diffusion process. (2) Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (D$^2$iT) at second stage generates images by predicting multi-grained noise, consisting of coarse-grained (less latent code in smooth regions) and fine-grained (more latent codes in detailed regions), through an novel combination of the Dynamic Grain Transformer and the Dynamic Content Transformer. The strategy of combining rough prediction of noise with detailed regions correction achieves a unification of global consistency and local realism. Comprehensive experiments on various generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be released atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual counterfactual explanations are ideal hypothetical images that change the decision-making of the classifier with high confidence toward the desired class while remaining visually plausible and close to the initial image. In this paper, we propose a new approach to tackle two key challenges in recent prominent works: i) determining which specific counterfactual features are crucial for distinguishing the "concept" of the target class from the original class, and ii) supplying valuable explanations for the non-robust classifier without relying on the support of an adversarially robust model. Our method identifies the essential region for modification through algorithms that provide visual explanations, and then our framework generates realistic counterfactual explanations by combining adversarial attacks based on pruning the adversarial gradient of the target classifier and the latent diffusion model. The proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art results on various evaluation criteria on ImageNet and CelebA-HQ datasets. In general, our method can be applied to arbitrary classifiers, highlight the strong association between visual and counterfactual explanations, make semantically meaningful changes from the target classifier, and provide observers with subtle counterfactual images.

  Reconstructing 3Ds of hand-object interaction (HOI) is a fundamental problem that can find numerous applications. Despite recent advances, there is no comprehensive pipeline yet for bimanual class-agnostic interaction reconstruction from a monocular RGB video, where two hands and an unknown object are interacting with each other. Previous works tackled the limited hand-object interaction case, where object templates are pre-known or only one hand is involved in the interaction. The bimanual interaction reconstruction exhibits severe occlusions introduced by complex interactions between two hands and an object. To solve this, we first introduce BIGS (Bimanual Interaction 3D Gaussian Splatting), a method that reconstructs 3D Gaussians of hands and an unknown object from a monocular video. To robustly obtain object Gaussians avoiding severe occlusions, we leverage prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model with score distillation sampling (SDS) loss, to reconstruct unseen object parts. For hand Gaussians, we exploit the 3D priors of hand model (i.e., MANO) and share a single Gaussian for two hands to effectively accumulate hand 3D information, given limited views. To further consider the 3D alignment between hands and objects, we include the interacting-subjects optimization step during Gaussian optimization. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on two challenging datasets, in terms of 3D hand pose estimation (MPJPE), 3D object reconstruction (CDh, CDo, F10), and rendering quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), respectively.

  Recent advances in generative modeling have enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic data that is applicable in a variety of domains, including face recognition. Here, state-of-the-art generative models typically rely on conditioning and fine-tuning of powerful pretrained diffusion models to facilitate the synthesis of realistic images of a desired identity. Yet, these models often do not consider the identity of subjects during training, leading to poor consistency between generated and intended identities. In contrast, methods that employ identity-based training objectives tend to overfit on various aspects of the identity, and in turn, lower the diversity of images that can be generated. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel generative diffusion-based framework, called ID-Booth. ID-Booth consists of a denoising network responsible for data generation, a variational auto-encoder for mapping images to and from a lower-dimensional latent space and a text encoder that allows for prompt-based control over the generation procedure. The framework utilizes a novel triplet identity training objective and enables identity-consistent image generation while retaining the synthesis capabilities of pretrained diffusion models. Experiments with a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model and diverse prompts reveal that our method facilitates better intra-identity consistency and inter-identity separability than competing methods, while achieving higher image diversity. In turn, the produced data allows for effective augmentation of small-scale datasets and training of better-performing recognition models in a privacy-preserving manner.

  Depth-guided multimodal fusion combines depth information from visible and infrared images, significantly enhancing the performance of 3D reconstruction and robotics applications. Existing thermal-visible image fusion mainly focuses on detection tasks, ignoring other critical information such as depth. By addressing the limitations of single modalities in low-light and complex environments, the depth information from fused images not only generates more accurate point cloud data, improving the completeness and precision of 3D reconstruction, but also provides comprehensive scene understanding for robot navigation, localization, and environmental perception. This supports precise recognition and efficient operations in applications such as autonomous driving and rescue missions. We introduce a text-guided and depth-driven infrared and visible image fusion network. The model consists of an image fusion branch for extracting multi-channel complementary information through a diffusion model, equipped with a text-guided module, and two auxiliary depth estimation branches. The fusion branch uses CLIP to extract semantic information and parameters from depth-enriched image descriptions to guide the diffusion model in extracting multi-channel features and generating fused images. These fused images are then input into the depth estimation branches to calculate depth-driven loss, optimizing the image fusion network. This framework aims to integrate vision-language and depth to directly generate color-fused images from multimodal inputs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imaging inverse problems can be solved in an unsupervised manner using pre-trained diffusion models, but doing so requires approximating the gradient of the measurement-conditional score function in the diffusion reverse process. We show that the approximations produced by existing methods are relatively poor, especially early in the reverse process, and so we propose a new approach that iteratively reestimates and "renoises" the estimate several times per diffusion step. This iterative approach, which we call Fast Iterative REnoising (FIRE), injects colored noise that is shaped to ensure that the pre-trained diffusion model always sees white noise, in accordance with how it was trained. We then embed FIRE into the DDIM reverse process and show that the resulting "DDfire" offers state-of-the-art accuracy and runtime on several linear inverse problems, as well as phase retrieval.

  Recent advances in large reconstruction and generative models have significantly improved scene reconstruction and novel view generation. However, due to compute limitations, each inference with these large models is confined to a small area, making long-range consistent scene generation challenging. To address this, we propose StarGen, a novel framework that employs a pre-trained video diffusion model in an autoregressive manner for long-range scene generation. The generation of each video clip is conditioned on the 3D warping of spatially adjacent images and the temporally overlapping image from previously generated clips, improving spatiotemporal consistency in long-range scene generation with precise pose control. The spatiotemporal condition is compatible with various input conditions, facilitating diverse tasks, including sparse view interpolation, perpetual view generation, and layout-conditioned city generation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate StarGen's superior scalability, fidelity, and pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative models trained on extensive high-quality datasets effectively capture the structural and statistical properties of clean images, rendering them powerful priors for transforming degraded features into clean ones in image restoration. VAR, a novel image generative paradigm, surpasses diffusion models in generation quality by applying a next-scale prediction approach. It progressively captures both global structures and fine-grained details through the autoregressive process, consistent with the multi-scale restoration principle widely acknowledged in the restoration community. Furthermore, we observe that during the image reconstruction process utilizing VAR, scale predictions automatically modulate the input, facilitating the alignment of representations at subsequent scales with the distribution of clean images. To harness VAR's adaptive distribution alignment capability in image restoration tasks, we formulate the multi-scale latent representations within VAR as the restoration prior, thus advancing our delicately designed VarFormer framework. The strategic application of these priors enables our VarFormer to achieve remarkable generalization on unseen tasks while also reducing training computational costs. Extensive experiments underscores that our VarFormer outperforms existing multi-task image restoration methods across various restoration tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Artistic image stylization aims to render the content provided by text or image with the target style, where content and style decoupling is the key to achieve satisfactory results. However, current methods for content and style disentanglement primarily rely on image supervision, which leads to two problems: 1) models can only support one modality for style or content input;2) incomplete disentanglement resulting in content leakage from the reference image. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multimodal approach to content-style disentanglement for artistic image stylization. We construct a \textit{WikiStyle+} dataset consists of artworks with corresponding textual descriptions for style and content. Based on the multimodal dataset, we propose a disentangled representations-guided diffusion model. The disentangled representations are first learned by Q-Formers and then injected into a pre-trained diffusion model using learnable multi-step cross-attention layers. Experimental results show that our method achieves a thorough disentanglement of content and style in reference images under multimodal supervision, thereby enabling more refined stylization that aligns with the artistic characteristics of the reference style. The code of our method will be available upon acceptance.

  Human image animation aims to generate a human motion video from the inputs of a reference human image and a target motion video. Current diffusion-based image animation systems exhibit high precision in transferring human identity into targeted motion, yet they still exhibit irregular quality in their outputs. Their optimal precision is achieved only when the physical compositions (i.e., scale and rotation) of the human shapes in the reference image and target pose frame are aligned. In the absence of such alignment, there is a noticeable decline in fidelity and consistency. Especially, in real-world environments, this compositional misalignment commonly occurs, posing significant challenges to the practical usage of current systems. To this end, we propose Test-time Procrustes Calibration (TPC), which enhances the robustness of diffusion-based image animation systems by maintaining optimal performance even when faced with compositional misalignment, effectively addressing real-world scenarios. The TPC provides a calibrated reference image for the diffusion model, enhancing its capability to understand the correspondence between human shapes in the reference and target images. Our method is simple and can be applied to any diffusion-based image animation system in a model-agnostic manner, improving the effectiveness at test time without additional training.

  In video editing, the hallmark of a quality edit lies in its consistent and unobtrusive adjustment. Modification, when integrated, must be smooth and subtle, preserving the natural flow and aligning seamlessly with the original vision. Therefore, our primary focus is on overcoming the current challenges in high quality edit to ensure that each edit enhances the final product without disrupting its intended essence. However, quality deterioration such as blurring and flickering is routinely observed in recent diffusion video editing systems. We confirm that this deterioration often stems from high-frequency leak: the diffusion model fails to accurately synthesize high-frequency components during denoising process. To this end, we devise Frequency Adapting Group (FRAG) which enhances the video quality in terms of consistency and fidelity by introducing a novel receptive field branch to preserve high-frequency components during the denoising process. FRAG is performed in a model-agnostic manner without additional training and validates the effectiveness on video editing benchmarks (i.e., TGVE, DAVIS).

  In text-to-motion generation, controllability as well as generation quality and speed has become increasingly critical. The controllability challenges include generating a motion of a length that matches the given textual description and editing the generated motions according to control signals, such as the start-end positions and the pelvis trajectory. In this paper, we propose MoLA, which provides fast, high-quality, variable-length motion generation and can also deal with multiple editing tasks in a single framework. Our approach revisits the motion representation used as inputs and outputs in the model, incorporating an activation variable to enable variable-length motion generation. Additionally, we integrate a variational autoencoder and a latent diffusion model, further enhanced through adversarial training, to achieve high-quality and fast generation. Moreover, we apply a training-free guided generation framework to achieve various editing tasks with motion control inputs. We quantitatively show the effectiveness of adversarial learning in text-to-motion generation, and demonstrate the applicability of our editing framework to multiple editing tasks in the motion domain.

  Visual representation models leveraging attention mechanisms are challenged by significant computational overhead, particularly when pursuing large receptive fields. In this study, we aim to mitigate this challenge by introducing the Heat Conduction Operator (HCO) built upon the physical heat conduction principle. HCO conceptualizes image patches as heat sources and models their correlations through adaptive thermal energy diffusion, enabling robust visual representations. HCO enjoys a computational complexity of O(N^1.5), as it can be implemented using discrete cosine transformation (DCT) operations. HCO is plug-and-play, combining with deep learning backbones produces visual representation models (termed vHeat) with global receptive fields. Experiments across vision tasks demonstrate that, beyond the stronger performance, vHeat achieves up to a 3x throughput, 80% less GPU memory allocation, and 35% fewer computational FLOPs compared to the Swin-Transformer.

  We introduce a novel approach for concept blending in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models, aiming to generate images at the intersection of multiple text prompts. At each time step during diffusion denoising, our algorithm forecasts predictions w.r.t. the generated image and makes informed text conditioning decisions. Central to our method is the unique analogy between diffusion models, which are rooted in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and the Black-Scholes model for financial option pricing. By drawing parallels between key variables in both domains, we derive a robust algorithm for concept blending that capitalizes on the Markovian dynamics of the Black-Scholes framework. Our text-based concept blending algorithm is data-efficient, meaning it does not need additional training. Furthermore, it operates without human intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We highlight the benefits of our approach by comparing it qualitatively and quantitatively to other text based concept blending techniques, including linear interpolation, alternating prompts, step-wise prompt switching, and CLIP-guided prompt selection across various scenarios such as single object per text prompt, multiple objects per text prompt and objects against backgrounds. Our work shows that financially inspired techniques can enhance text-to-image concept blending in generative AI, paving the way for broader innovation. Code is available atthis https URL.

  This paper aims to generate materials for 3D meshes from text descriptions. Unlike existing methods that synthesize texture maps, we propose to generate segment-wise procedural material graphs as the appearance representation, which supports high-quality rendering and provides substantial flexibility in editing. Instead of relying on extensive paired data, i.e., 3D meshes with material graphs and corresponding text descriptions, to train a material graph generative model, we propose to leverage the pre-trained 2D diffusion model as a bridge to connect the text and material graphs. Specifically, our approach decomposes a shape into a set of segments and designs a segment-controlled diffusion model to synthesize 2D images that are aligned with mesh parts. Based on generated images, we initialize parameters of material graphs and fine-tune them through the differentiable rendering module to produce materials in accordance with the textual description. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in photorealism, resolution, and editability over existing methods. Project page:this https URL

  Although diffusion models can generate high-quality human images, their applications are limited by the instability in generating hands with correct structures. In this paper, we introduce RHanDS, a conditional diffusion-based framework designed to refine malformed hands by utilizing decoupled structure and style guidance. The hand mesh reconstructed from the malformed hand offers structure guidance for correcting the structure of the hand, while the malformed hand itself provides style guidance for preserving the style of the hand. To alleviate the mutual interference between style and structure guidance, we introduce a two-stage training strategy and build a series of multi-style hand datasets. In the first stage, we use paired hand images for training to ensure stylistic consistency in hand refining. In the second stage, various hand images generated based on human meshes are used for training, enabling the model to gain control over the hand structure. Experimental results demonstrate that RHanDS can effectively refine hand structure while preserving consistency in hand style.

  Customized text-to-video generation aims to generate text-guided videos with user-given subjects, which has gained increasing attention. However, existing works are primarily limited to single-subject oriented text-to-video generation, leaving the more challenging problem of customized multi-subject generation unexplored. In this paper, we fill this gap and propose a novel VideoDreamer framework, which can generate temporally consistent text-guided videos that faithfully preserve the visual features of the given multiple subjects. Specifically, VideoDreamer adopts the pretrained Stable Diffusion with temporal modules as its base video generator, taking the power of the text-to-image model to generate diversified content. The video generator is further customized for multi-subjects, which leverages the proposed Disen-Mix Finetuning and Human-in-the-Loop Re-finetuning strategy, to tackle the attribute binding problem of multi-subject generation. Additionally, we present a disentangled motion customization strategy to finetune the temporal modules so that we can generate videos with both customized subjects and motions. To evaluate the performance of customized multi-subject text-to-video generation, we introduce the MultiStudioBench benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable ability of VideoDreamer to generate videos with new content such as new events and backgrounds, tailored to the customized multiple subjects.
