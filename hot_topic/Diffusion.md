- **[Diffusion Active Learning: Towards Data-Driven Experimental Design in Computed Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03491)**  `arXiv:2504.03491`  `cs.LG`

  We introduce Diffusion Active Learning, a novel approach that combines generative diffusion modeling with data-driven sequential experimental design to adaptively acquire data for inverse problems. Although broadly applicable, we focus on scientific computed tomography (CT) for experimental validation, where structured prior datasets are available, and reducing data requirements directly translates to shorter measurement times and lower X-ray doses. We first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model on domain-specific CT reconstructions. The diffusion model acts as a learned prior that is data-dependent and captures the structure of the underlying data distribution, which is then used in two ways: It drives the active learning process and also improves the quality of the reconstructions. During the active learning loop, we employ a variant of diffusion posterior sampling to generate conditional data samples from the posterior distribution, ensuring consistency with the current measurements. Using these samples, we quantify the uncertainty in the current estimate to select the most informative next measurement. Our results show substantial reductions in data acquisition requirements, corresponding to lower X-ray doses, while simultaneously improving image reconstruction quality across multiple real-world tomography datasets.

  Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modelling atomic interactions with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Recently, denoising diffusion models have shown promise in NNPs by training networks to remove noise added to stable configurations, eliminating the need for force data during training. In this work, we explore the connection between noise and forces by providing a new, simplified mathematical derivation of their relationship. We also demonstrate how a denoising model can be implemented using a conventional MD software package interfaced with a standard NNP architecture. We demonstrate the approach by training a diffusion-based NNP to simulate a coarse-grained lithium chloride solution and employ data duplication to enhance model performance.

- **[How I Warped Your Noise: a Temporally-Correlated Noise Prior for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03072)**  `arXiv:2504.03072`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  Video editing and generation methods often rely on pre-trained image-based diffusion models. During the diffusion process, however, the reliance on rudimentary noise sampling techniques that do not preserve correlations present in subsequent frames of a video is detrimental to the quality of the results. This either produces high-frequency flickering, or texture-sticking artifacts that are not amenable to post-processing. With this in mind, we propose a novel method for preserving temporal correlations in a sequence of noise samples. This approach is materialized by a novel noise representation, dubbed $\int$-noise (integral noise), that reinterprets individual noise samples as a continuously integrated noise field: pixel values do not represent discrete values, but are rather the integral of an underlying infinite-resolution noise over the pixel area. Additionally, we propose a carefully tailored transport method that uses $\int$-noise to accurately advect noise samples over a sequence of frames, maximizing the correlation between different frames while also preserving the noise properties. Our results demonstrate that the proposed $\int$-noise can be used for a variety of tasks, such as video restoration, surrogate rendering, and conditional video generation.

- **[One-Shot Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Local Model-Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08870)**  `arXiv:2311.08870`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  In recent years, One-shot Federated Learning methods based on Diffusion Models have garnered increasing attention due to their remarkable performance. However, most of these methods require the deployment of foundation models on client devices, which significantly raises the computational requirements and reduces their adaptability to heterogeneous client models compared to traditional FL methods. In this paper, we propose FedLMG, a heterogeneous one-shot Federated learning method with Local Model-Guided diffusion models. Briefly speaking, in FedLMG, clients do not need access to any foundation models but only train and upload their local models, which is consistent with traditional FL methods. On the clients, we employ classification loss and BN loss to capture the broad category features and detailed contextual features of the client distributions. On the server, based on the uploaded client models, we utilize backpropagation to guide the server's DM in generating synthetic datasets that comply with the client distributions, which are then used to train the aggregated model. By using the locally trained client models as a medium to transfer client knowledge, our method significantly reduces the computational requirements on client devices and effectively adapts to scenarios with heterogeneous clients. Extensive quantitation and visualization experiments on three large-scale real-world datasets, along with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that the synthetic datasets generated by FedLMG exhibit comparable quality and diversity to the client datasets, which leads to an aggregated model that outperforms all compared methods and even the performance ceiling, further elucidating the significant potential of utilizing DMs in FL.

- **[BUFF: Bayesian Uncertainty Guided Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03490)**  `arXiv:2504.03490`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Zihao He, Shengchuan Zhang, Runze Hu, Yunhang Shen, Yan Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Super-resolution (SR) techniques are critical for enhancing image quality, particularly in scenarios where high-resolution imagery is essential yet limited by hardware constraints. Existing diffusion models for SR have relied predominantly on Gaussian models for noise generation, which often fall short when dealing with the complex and variable texture inherent in natural scenes. To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Bayesian Uncertainty Guided Diffusion Probabilistic Model (BUFF). BUFF distinguishes itself by incorporating a Bayesian network to generate high-resolution uncertainty masks. These masks guide the diffusion process, allowing for the adjustment of noise intensity in a manner that is both context-aware and adaptive. This novel approach not only enhances the fidelity of super-resolved images to their original high-resolution counterparts but also significantly mitigates artifacts and blurring in areas characterized by complex textures and fine details. The model demonstrates exceptional robustness against complex noise patterns and showcases superior adaptability in handling textures and edges within images. Empirical evidence, supported by visual results, illustrates the model's robustness, especially in challenging scenarios, and its effectiveness in addressing common SR issues such as blurring. Experimental evaluations conducted on the DIV2K dataset reveal that BUFF achieves a notable improvement, with a +0.61 increase compared to baseline in SSIM on BSD100, surpassing traditional diffusion approaches by an average additional +0.20dB PSNR gain. These findings underscore the potential of Bayesian methods in enhancing diffusion processes for SR, paving the way for future advancements in the field.

- **[Multimodal Diffusion Bridge with Attention-Based SAR Fusion for Satellite Image Cloud Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03607)**  `arXiv:2504.03607`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yuyang Hu, Suhas Lohit, Ulugbek S. Kamilov, Tim K. Marks_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning has achieved some success in addressing the challenge of cloud removal in optical satellite images, by fusing with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for cloud removal, delivering higher-quality estimation by sampling from cloud-free distributions, compared to earlier methods. However, diffusion models initiate sampling from pure Gaussian noise, which complicates the sampling trajectory and results in suboptimal performance. Also, current methods fall short in effectively fusing SAR and optical data. To address these limitations, we propose Diffusion Bridges for Cloud Removal, DB-CR, which directly bridges between the cloudy and cloud-free image distributions. In addition, we propose a novel multimodal diffusion bridge architecture with a two-branch backbone for multimodal image restoration, incorporating an efficient backbone and dedicated cross-modality fusion blocks to effectively extract and fuse features from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images. By formulating cloud removal as a diffusion-bridge problem and leveraging this tailored architecture, DB-CR achieves high-fidelity results while being computationally efficient. We evaluated DB-CR on the SEN12MS-CR cloud-removal dataset, demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art results.

- **[Dynamic Importance in Diffusion U-Net for Enhanced Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03471)**  `arXiv:2504.03471`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xi Wang, Ziqi He, Yang Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional diffusion models typically employ a U-Net architecture. Previous studies have unveiled the roles of attention blocks in the U-Net. However, they overlook the dynamic evolution of their importance during the inference process, which hinders their further exploitation to improve image applications. In this study, we first theoretically proved that, re-weighting the outputs of the Transformer blocks within the U-Net is a "free lunch" for improving the signal-to-noise ratio during the sampling process. Next, we proposed Importance Probe to uncover and quantify the dynamic shifts in importance of the Transformer blocks throughout the denoising process. Finally, we design an adaptive importance-based re-weighting schedule tailored to specific image generation and editing tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the inference process, and enhances the aesthetic quality of the samples with identity consistency. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into any U-Net-based architecture. Code:this https URL

  Adjusting and deforming 3D garments to body shapes, body motion, and cloth material is an important problem in virtual and augmented reality. Applications are numerous, ranging from virtual change rooms to the entertainment and gaming industry. This problem is challenging as garment dynamics influence geometric details such as wrinkling patterns, which depend on physical input including the wearer's body shape and motion, as well as cloth material features. Existing work studies learning-based modeling techniques to generate garment deformations from example data, and physics-inspired simulators to generate realistic garment dynamics. We propose here a learning-based approach trained on data generated with a physics-based simulator. Compared to prior work, our 3D generative model learns garment deformations for loose cloth geometry, especially for large deformations and dynamic wrinkles driven by body motion and cloth material. Furthermore, the model can be efficiently fitted to observations captured using vision sensors. We propose to leverage the capability of diffusion models to learn fine-scale detail: we model the 3D garment in a 2D parameter space, and learn a latent diffusion model using this representation independent from the mesh resolution. This allows to condition global and local geometric information with body and material information. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our method on both simulated data and data captured with a multi-view acquisition platform. Compared to strong baselines, our method is more accurate in terms of Chamfer distance.

- **[FaR: Enhancing Multi-Concept Text-to-Image Diffusion via Concept Fusion and Localized Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03292)**  `arXiv:2504.03292`  `cs.CV`  
  _Gia-Nghia Tran, Quang-Huy Che, Trong-Tai Dam Vu, Bich-Nga Pham, Vinh-Tiep Nguyen, Trung-Nghia Le, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating multiple new concepts remains a challenging problem in the text-to-image task. Current methods often overfit when trained on a small number of samples and struggle with attribute leakage, particularly for class-similar subjects (e.g., two specific dogs). In this paper, we introduce Fuse-and-Refine (FaR), a novel approach that tackles these challenges through two key contributions: Concept Fusion technique and Localized Refinement loss function. Concept Fusion systematically augments the training data by separating reference subjects from backgrounds and recombining them into composite images to increase diversity. This augmentation technique tackles the overfitting problem by mitigating the narrow distribution of the limited training samples. In addition, Localized Refinement loss function is introduced to preserve subject representative attributes by aligning each concept's attention map to its correct region. This approach effectively prevents attribute leakage by ensuring that the diffusion model distinguishes similar subjects without mixing their attention maps during the denoising process. By fine-tuning specific modules at the same time, FaR balances the learning of new concepts with the retention of previously learned knowledge. Empirical results show that FaR not only prevents overfitting and attribute leakage while maintaining photorealism, but also outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

- **[Model Reveals What to Cache: Profiling-Based Feature Reuse for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03140)**  `arXiv:2504.03140`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xuran Ma, Yexin Liu, Yaofu Liu, Xianfeng Wu, Mingzhe Zheng, Zihao Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video generation. However, the computational intensity remains a significant challenge for practical applications. While feature caching has been proposed to reduce the computational burden of diffusion models, existing methods typically overlook the heterogeneous significance of individual blocks, resulting in suboptimal reuse and degraded output quality. To this end, we address this gap by introducing ProfilingDiT, a novel adaptive caching strategy that explicitly disentangles foreground and background-focused blocks. Through a systematic analysis of attention distributions in diffusion models, we reveal a key observation: 1) Most layers exhibit a consistent preference for either foreground or background regions. 2) Predicted noise shows low inter-step similarity initially, which stabilizes as denoising progresses. This finding inspires us to formulate a selective caching strategy that preserves full computation for dynamic foreground elements while efficiently caching static background features. Our approach substantially reduces computational overhead while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant acceleration (e.g., 2.01 times speedup for Wan2.1) while maintaining visual fidelity across comprehensive quality metrics, establishing a viable method for efficient video generation.

- **[DiSRT-In-Bed: Diffusion-Based Sim-to-Real Transfer Framework for In-Bed Human Mesh Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03006)**  `arXiv:2504.03006`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jing Gao, Ce Zheng, Laszlo A. Jeni, Zackory Erickson_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-bed human mesh recovery can be crucial and enabling for several healthcare applications, including sleep pattern monitoring, rehabilitation support, and pressure ulcer prevention. However, it is difficult to collect large real-world visual datasets in this domain, in part due to privacy and expense constraints, which in turn presents significant challenges for training and deploying deep learning models. Existing in-bed human mesh estimation methods often rely heavily on real-world data, limiting their ability to generalize across different in-bed scenarios, such as varying coverings and environmental settings. To address this, we propose a Sim-to-Real Transfer Framework for in-bed human mesh recovery from overhead depth images, which leverages large-scale synthetic data alongside limited or no real-world samples. We introduce a diffusion model that bridges the gap between synthetic data and real data to support generalization in real-world in-bed pose and body inference scenarios. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness and adaptability across diverse healthcare scenarios.

- **[Audio-visual Controlled Video Diffusion with Masked Selective State Spaces Modeling for Natural Talking Head Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02542)**  `arXiv:2504.02542`  `cs.CV`  
  _Fa-Ting Hong, Zunnan Xu, Zixiang Zhou, Jun Zhou, Xiu Li, Qin Lin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Talking head synthesis is vital for virtual avatars and human-computer interaction. However, most existing methods are typically limited to accepting control from a single primary modality, restricting their practical utility. To this end, we introduce \textbf{ACTalker}, an end-to-end video diffusion framework that supports both multi-signals control and single-signal control for talking head video generation. For multiple control, we design a parallel mamba structure with multiple branches, each utilizing a separate driving signal to control specific facial regions. A gate mechanism is applied across all branches, providing flexible control over video generation. To ensure natural coordination of the controlled video both temporally and spatially, we employ the mamba structure, which enables driving signals to manipulate feature tokens across both dimensions in each branch. Additionally, we introduce a mask-drop strategy that allows each driving signal to independently control its corresponding facial region within the mamba structure, preventing control conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces natural-looking facial videos driven by diverse signals and that the mamba layer seamlessly integrates multiple driving modalities without conflict.

- **[Training-Free Style and Content Transfer by Leveraging U-Net Skip Connections in Stable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14524)**  `arXiv:2501.14524`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ludovica Schaerf, Andrea Alfarano, Fabrizio Silvestri, Leonardo Impett_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in diffusion models for image generation have led to detailed examinations of several components within the U-Net architecture for image editing. While previous studies have focused on the bottleneck layer (h-space), cross-attention, self-attention, and decoding layers, the overall role of the skip connections of the U-Net itself has not been specifically addressed. We conduct thorough analyses on the role of the skip connections and find that the residual connections passed by the third encoder block carry most of the spatial information of the reconstructed image, splitting the content from the style, passed by the remaining stream in the opposed decoding layer. We show that injecting the representations from this block can be used for text-based editing, precise modifications, and style transfer. We compare our method, SkipInject, to state-of-the-art style transfer and image editing methods and demonstrate that our method obtains the best content alignment and optimal structural preservation tradeoff.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predicting the dynamics of interacting objects is essential for both humans and intelligent systems. However, existing approaches are limited to simplified, toy settings and lack generalizability to complex, real-world environments. Recent advances in generative models have enabled the prediction of state transitions based on interventions, but focus on generating a single future state which neglects the continuous dynamics resulting from the interaction. To address this gap, we propose InterDyn, a novel framework that generates videos of interactive dynamics given an initial frame and a control signal encoding the motion of a driving object or actor. Our key insight is that large video generation models can act as both neural renderers and implicit physics ``simulators'', having learned interactive dynamics from large-scale video data. To effectively harness this capability, we introduce an interactive control mechanism that conditions the video generation process on the motion of the driving entity. Qualitative results demonstrate that InterDyn generates plausible, temporally consistent videos of complex object interactions while generalizing to unseen objects. Quantitative evaluations show that InterDyn outperforms baselines that focus on static state transitions. This work highlights the potential of leveraging video generative models as implicit physics engines. Project page:this https URL

- **[Edge-SD-SR: Low Latency and Parameter Efficient On-device Super-Resolution with Stable Diffusion via Bidirectional Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06978)**  `arXiv:2412.06978`  `cs.CV`  
  _Mehdi Noroozi, Isma Hadji, Victor Escorcia, Anestis Zaganidis, Brais Martinez, Georgios Tzimiropoulos_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There has been immense progress recently in the visual quality of Stable Diffusion-based Super Resolution (SD-SR). However, deploying large diffusion models on computationally restricted devices such as mobile phones remains impractical due to the large model size and high latency. This is compounded for SR as it often operates at high res (e.g. 4Kx3K). In this work, we introduce Edge-SD-SR, the first parameter efficient and low latency diffusion model for image super-resolution. Edge-SD-SR consists of ~169M parameters, including UNet, encoder and decoder, and has a complexity of only ~142 GFLOPs. To maintain a high visual quality on such low compute budget, we introduce a number of training strategies: (i) A novel conditioning mechanism on the low resolution input, coined bidirectional conditioning, which tailors the SD model for the SR task. (ii) Joint training of the UNet and encoder, while decoupling the encodings of the HR and LR images and using a dedicated schedule. (iii) Finetuning the decoder using the UNet's output to directly tailor the decoder to the latents obtained at inference time. Edge-SD-SR runs efficiently on device, e.g. it can upscale a 128x128 patch to 512x512 in 38 msec while running on a Samsung S24 DSP, and of a 512x512 to 2048x2048 (requiring 25 model evaluations) in just ~1.1 sec. Furthermore, we show that Edge-SD-SR matches or even outperforms state-of-the-art SR approaches on the most established SR benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Non-verbal communication often comprises of semantically rich gestures that help convey the meaning of an utterance. Producing such semantic co-speech gestures has been a major challenge for the existing neural systems that can generate rhythmic beat gestures, but struggle to produce semantically meaningful gestures. Therefore, we present RAG-Gesture, a diffusion-based gesture generation approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce natural-looking and semantically rich gestures. Our neuro-explicit gesture generation approach is designed to produce semantic gestures grounded in interpretable linguistic knowledge. We achieve this by using explicit domain knowledge to retrieve exemplar motions from a database of co-speech gestures. Once retrieved, we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into our diffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrieval guidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further, we propose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate the amount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence. Our comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach against recent gesture generation approaches. The reader is urged to explore the results on our project page.

- **[ReviveDiff: A Universal Diffusion Model for Restoring Images in Adverse Weather Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18932)**  `arXiv:2409.18932`  `cs.CV`  
  _Wenfeng Huang, Guoan Xu, Wenjing Jia, Stuart Perry, Guangwei Gao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Images captured in challenging environments--such as nighttime, smoke, rainy weather, and underwater--often suffer from significant degradation, resulting in a substantial loss of visual quality. The effective restoration of these degraded images is critical for the subsequent vision tasks. While many existing approaches have successfully incorporated specific priors for individual tasks, these tailored solutions limit their applicability to other degradations. In this work, we propose a universal network architecture, dubbed ``ReviveDiff'', which can address various degradations and bring images back to life by enhancing and restoring their quality. Our approach is inspired by the observation that, unlike degradation caused by movement or electronic issues, quality degradation under adverse conditions primarily stems from natural media (such as fog, water, and low luminance), which generally preserves the original structures of objects. To restore the quality of such images, we leveraged the latest advancements in diffusion models and developed ReviveDiff to restore image quality from both macro and micro levels across some key factors determining image quality, such as sharpness, distortion, noise level, dynamic range, and color accuracy. We rigorously evaluated ReviveDiff on seven benchmark datasets covering five types of degrading conditions: Rainy, Underwater, Low-light, Smoke, and Nighttime Hazy. Our experimental results demonstrate that ReviveDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually.
