- **[DM-OSVP++: One-Shot View Planning Using 3D Diffusion Models for Active RGB-Based Object Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11674)**  `arXiv:2504.11674`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  Active object reconstruction is crucial for many robotic applications. A key aspect in these scenarios is generating object-specific view configurations to obtain informative measurements for reconstruction. One-shot view planning enables efficient data collection by predicting all views at once, eliminating the need for time-consuming online replanning. Our primary insight is to leverage the generative power of 3D diffusion models as valuable prior information. By conditioning on initial multi-view images, we exploit the priors from the 3D diffusion model to generate an approximate object model, serving as the foundation for our view planning. Our novel approach integrates the geometric and textural distributions of the object model into the view planning process, generating views that focus on the complex parts of the object to be reconstructed. We validate the proposed active object reconstruction system through both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of using 3D diffusion priors for one-shot view planning.

- **[LANGTRAJ: Diffusion Model and Dataset for Language-Conditioned Trajectory Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11521)**  `arXiv:2504.11521`  `cs.LG` `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating autonomous vehicles with controllability enables scalable testing in counterfactual or structured settings, enhancing both efficiency and safety. We introduce LangTraj, a language-conditioned scene-diffusion model that simulates the joint behavior of all agents in traffic scenarios. By conditioning on natural language inputs, LangTraj provides flexible and intuitive control over interactive behaviors, generating nuanced and realistic scenarios. Unlike prior approaches that depend on domain-specific guidance functions, LangTraj incorporates language conditioning during training, facilitating more intuitive traffic simulation control. We propose a novel closed-loop training strategy for diffusion models, explicitly tailored to enhance stability and realism during closed-loop simulation. To support language-conditioned simulation, we develop Inter-Drive, a large-scale dataset with diverse and interactive labels for training language-conditioned diffusion models. Our dataset is built upon a scalable pipeline for annotating agent-agent interactions and single-agent behaviors, ensuring rich and varied supervision. Validated on the Waymo Motion Dataset, LangTraj demonstrates strong performance in realism, language controllability, and language-conditioned safety-critical simulation, establishing a new paradigm for flexible and scalable autonomous vehicle testing.

- **[SemDiff: Generating Natural Unrestricted Adversarial Examples via Semantic Attributes Optimization in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11923)**  `arXiv:2504.11923`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Zeyu Dai, Shengcai Liu, Rui He, Jiahao Wu, Ning Lu, Wenqi Fan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs), allow the attacker to create non-constrained adversarial examples without given clean samples, posing a severe threat to the safety of deep learning models. Recent works utilize diffusion models to generate UAEs. However, these UAEs often lack naturalness and imperceptibility due to simply optimizing in intermediate latent noises. In light of this, we propose SemDiff, a novel unrestricted adversarial attack that explores the semantic latent space of diffusion models for meaningful attributes, and devises a multi-attributes optimization approach to ensure attack success while maintaining the naturalness and imperceptibility of generated UAEs. We perform extensive experiments on four tasks on three high-resolution datasets, including CelebA-HQ, AFHQ and ImageNet. The results demonstrate that SemDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of attack success rate and imperceptibility. The generated UAEs are natural and exhibit semantically meaningful changes, in accord with the attributes' weights. In addition, SemDiff is found capable of evading different defenses, which further validates its effectiveness and threatening.

- **[Adjoint Sampling: Highly Scalable Diffusion Samplers via Adjoint Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11713)**  `arXiv:2504.11713`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Aaron Havens, Benjamin Kurt Miller, Bing Yan, Carles Domingo-Enrich, Anuroop Sriram, Brandon Wood, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Adjoint Sampling, a highly scalable and efficient algorithm for learning diffusion processes that sample from unnormalized densities, or energy functions. It is the first on-policy approach that allows significantly more gradient updates than the number of energy evaluations and model samples, allowing us to scale to much larger problem settings than previously explored by similar methods. Our framework is theoretically grounded in stochastic optimal control and shares the same theoretical guarantees as Adjoint Matching, being able to train without the need for corrective measures that push samples towards the target distribution. We show how to incorporate key symmetries, as well as periodic boundary conditions, for modeling molecules in both cartesian and torsional coordinates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on classical energy functions, and further scale up to neural network-based energy models where we perform amortized conformer generation across many molecular systems. To encourage further research in developing highly scalable sampling methods, we plan to open source these challenging benchmarks, where successful methods can directly impact progress in computational chemistry.

- **[Fine-Tuning Diffusion Generative Models via Rich Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11720)**  `arXiv:2503.11720`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Hanyang Zhao, Haoxian Chen, Yucheng Guo, Genta Indra Winata, Tingting Ou, Ziyu Huang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Rich Preference Optimization (RPO), a novel pipeline that leverages rich feedback signals to improve the curation of preference pairs for fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models. Traditional methods, like Diffusion-DPO, often rely solely on reward model labeling, which can be opaque, offer limited insights into the rationale behind preferences, and are prone to issues such as reward hacking or overfitting. In contrast, our approach begins with generating detailed critiques of synthesized images to extract reliable and actionable image editing instructions. By implementing these instructions, we create refined images, resulting in synthetic, informative preference pairs that serve as enhanced tuning datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and the resulting datasets in fine-tuning state-of-the-art diffusion models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are indispensable for infrastructure inspection, surveillance, and related tasks, yet they also introduce critical security challenges. This survey provides a wide-ranging examination of the anti-UAV domain, centering on three core objectives-classification, detection, and tracking-while detailing emerging methodologies such as diffusion-based data synthesis, multi-modal fusion, vision-language modeling, self-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art solutions across both single-modality and multi-sensor pipelines (spanning RGB, infrared, audio, radar, and RF) and discuss large-scale as well as adversarially oriented benchmarks. Our analysis reveals persistent gaps in real-time performance, stealth detection, and swarm-based scenarios, underscoring pressing needs for robust, adaptive anti-UAV systems. By highlighting open research directions, we aim to foster innovation and guide the development of next-generation defense strategies in an era marked by the extensive use of UAVs.

- **[How Do I Do That? Synthesizing 3D Hand Motion and Contacts for Everyday Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12284)**  `arXiv:2504.12284`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Aditya Prakash, Benjamin Lundell, Dmitry Andreychuk, David Forsyth, Saurabh Gupta, Harpreet Sawhney_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We tackle the novel problem of predicting 3D hand motion and contact maps (or Interaction Trajectories) given a single RGB view, action text, and a 3D contact point on the object as input. Our approach consists of (1) Interaction Codebook: a VQVAE model to learn a latent codebook of hand poses and contact points, effectively tokenizing interaction trajectories, (2) Interaction Predictor: a transformer-decoder module to predict the interaction trajectory from test time inputs by using an indexer module to retrieve a latent affordance from the learned codebook. To train our model, we develop a data engine that extracts 3D hand poses and contact trajectories from the diverse HoloAssist dataset. We evaluate our model on a benchmark that is 2.5-10X larger than existing works, in terms of diversity of objects and interactions observed, and test for generalization of the model across object categories, action categories, tasks, and scenes. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach over transformer & diffusion baselines across all settings.

- **[Orthus: Autoregressive Interleaved Image-Text Generation with Modality-Specific Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00127)**  `arXiv:2412.00127`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Siqi Kou, Jiachun Jin, Zhihong Liu, Chang Liu, Ye Ma, Jian Jia, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Orthus, an autoregressive (AR) transformer that excels in generating images given textual prompts, answering questions based on visual inputs, and even crafting lengthy image-text interleaved contents. Unlike prior arts on unified multimodal modeling, Orthus simultaneously copes with discrete text tokens and continuous image features under the AR modeling principle. The continuous treatment of visual signals minimizes the information loss for both image understanding and generation while the fully AR formulation renders the characterization of the correlation between modalities straightforward. The key mechanism enabling Orthus to leverage these advantages lies in its modality-specific heads -- one regular language modeling (LM) head predicts discrete text tokens and one diffusion head generates continuous image features conditioning on the output of the backbone. We devise an efficient strategy for building Orthus -- by substituting the Vector Quantization (VQ) operation in the existing unified AR model with a soft alternative, introducing a diffusion head, and tuning the added modules to reconstruct images, we can create an Orthus-base model effortlessly (e.g., within mere 72 A100 GPU hours). Orthus-base can further embrace post-training to better model interleaved images and texts. Empirically, Orthus surpasses competing baselines including Show-o and Chameleon across standard benchmarks, achieving a GenEval score of 0.58 and an MME-P score of 1265.8 using 7B parameters. Orthus also shows exceptional mixed-modality generation capabilities, reflecting the potential for handling intricate practical generation tasks.

- **[Towards Safe Synthetic Image Generation On the Web: A Multimodal Robust NSFW Defense and Million Scale Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11707)**  `arXiv:2504.11707`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Muhammad Shahid Muneer, Simon S. Woo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the past years, we have witnessed the remarkable success of Text-to-Image (T2I) models and their widespread use on the web. Extensive research in making T2I models produce hyper-realistic images has led to new concerns, such as generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) web content and polluting the web society. To help prevent misuse of T2I models and create a safer web environment for users features like NSFW filters and post-hoc security checks are used in these models. However, recent work unveiled how these methods can easily fail to prevent misuse. In particular, adversarial attacks on text and image modalities can easily outplay defensive measures. %Exploiting such leads to the growing concern of preventing adversarial attacks on text and image modalities. Moreover, there is currently no robust multimodal NSFW dataset that includes both prompt and image pairs and adversarial examples. This work proposes a million-scale prompt and image dataset generated using open-source diffusion models. Second, we develop a multimodal defense to distinguish safe and NSFW text and images, which is robust against adversarial attacks and directly alleviates current challenges. Our extensive experiments show that our model performs well against existing SOTA NSFW detection methods in terms of accuracy and recall, drastically reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) in multimodal adversarial attack scenarios.

- **[OpenSDI: Spotting Diffusion-Generated Images in the Open World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19653)**  `arXiv:2503.19653`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yabin Wang, Zhiwu Huang, Xiaopeng Hong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper identifies OpenSDI, a challenge for spotting diffusion-generated images in open-world settings. In response to this challenge, we define a new benchmark, the OpenSDI dataset (OpenSDID), which stands out from existing datasets due to its diverse use of large vision-language models that simulate open-world diffusion-based manipulations. Another outstanding feature of OpenSDID is its inclusion of both detection and localization tasks for images manipulated globally and locally by diffusion models. To address the OpenSDI challenge, we propose a Synergizing Pretrained Models (SPM) scheme to build up a mixture of foundation models. This approach exploits a collaboration mechanism with multiple pretrained foundation models to enhance generalization in the OpenSDI context, moving beyond traditional training by synergizing multiple pretrained models through prompting and attending strategies. Building on this scheme, we introduce MaskCLIP, an SPM-based model that aligns Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) with Masked Autoencoder (MAE). Extensive evaluations on OpenSDID show that MaskCLIP significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for the OpenSDI challenge, achieving remarkable relative improvements of 14.23% in IoU (14.11% in F1) and 2.05% in accuracy (2.38% in F1) compared to the second-best model in localization and detection tasks, respectively. Our dataset and code are available atthis https URL.

- **[Versatile Multimodal Controls for Expressive Talking Human Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08714)**  `arXiv:2503.08714`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In filmmaking, directors typically allow actors to perform freely based on the script before providing specific guidance on how to present key actions. AI-generated content faces similar requirements, where users not only need automatic generation of lip synchronization and basic gestures from audio input but also desire semantically accurate and expressive body movement that can be ``directly guided'' through text descriptions. Therefore, we present VersaAnimator, a versatile framework that synthesizes expressive talking human videos from arbitrary portrait images. Specifically, we design a motion generator that produces basic rhythmic movements from audio input and supports text-prompt control for specific actions. The generated whole-body 3D motion tokens can animate portraits of various scales, producing talking heads, half-body gestures and even leg movements for whole-body images. Besides, we introduce a multi-modal controlled video diffusion that generates photorealistic videos, where speech signals govern lip synchronization, facial expressions, and head motions while body movements are guided by the 2D poses. Furthermore, we introduce a token2pose translator to smoothly map 3D motion tokens to 2D pose sequences. This design mitigates the stiffness resulting from direct 3D to 2D conversion and enhances the details of the generated body movements. Extensive experiments shows that VersaAnimator synthesizes lip-synced and identity-preserving videos while generating expressive and semantically meaningful whole-body motions.

- **[GST: Precise 3D Human Body from a Single Image with Gaussian Splatting Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04196)**  `arXiv:2409.04196`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing posed 3D human models from monocular images has important applications in the sports industry, including performance tracking, injury prevention and virtual training. In this work, we combine 3D human pose and shape estimation with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a representation of the scene composed of a mixture of Gaussians. This allows training or fine-tuning a human model predictor on multi-view images alone, without 3D ground truth. Predicting such mixtures for a human from a single input image is challenging due to self-occlusions and dependence on articulations, while also needing to retain enough flexibility to accommodate a variety of clothes and poses. Our key observation is that the vertices of standardized human meshes (such as SMPL) can provide an adequate spatial density and approximate initial position for the Gaussians. We can then train a transformer model to jointly predict comparatively small adjustments to these positions, as well as the other 3DGS attributes and the SMPL parameters. We show empirically that this combination (using only multi-view supervision) can achieve near real-time inference of 3D human models from a single image without expensive diffusion models or 3D points supervision, thus making it ideal for the sport industry at any level. More importantly, rendering is an effective auxiliary objective to refine 3D pose estimation by accounting for clothes and other geometric variations. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Transformer(DiT)-based generation models have achieved remarkable success in video generation. However, their inherent computational demands pose significant efficiency challenges. In this paper, we exploit the inherent temporal non-uniformity of real-world videos and observe that videos exhibit dynamic information density, with high-motion segments demanding greater detail preservation than static scenes. Inspired by this temporal non-uniformity, we propose VGDFR, a training-free approach for Diffusion-based Video Generation with Dynamic Latent Frame Rate. VGDFR adaptively adjusts the number of elements in latent space based on the motion frequency of the latent space content, using fewer tokens for low-frequency segments while preserving detail in high-frequency segments. Specifically, our key contributions are: (1) A dynamic frame rate scheduler for DiT video generation that adaptively assigns frame rates for video segments. (2) A novel latent-space frame merging method to align latent representations with their denoised counterparts before merging those redundant in low-resolution space. (3) A preference analysis of Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) across DiT layers, informing a tailored RoPE strategy optimized for semantic and local information capture. Experiments show that VGDFR can achieve a speedup up to 3x for video generation with minimal quality degradation.

- **[Cobra: Efficient Line Art COlorization with BRoAder References](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12240)**  `arXiv:2504.12240`  `cs.CV`  
  _Junhao Zhuang, Lingen Li, Xuan Ju, Zhaoyang Zhang, Chun Yuan, Ying Shan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The comic production industry requires reference-based line art colorization with high accuracy, efficiency, contextual consistency, and flexible control. A comic page often involves diverse characters, objects, and backgrounds, which complicates the coloring process. Despite advancements in diffusion models for image generation, their application in line art colorization remains limited, facing challenges related to handling extensive reference images, time-consuming inference, and flexible control. We investigate the necessity of extensive contextual image guidance on the quality of line art colorization. To address these challenges, we introduce Cobra, an efficient and versatile method that supports color hints and utilizes over 200 reference images while maintaining low latency. Central to Cobra is a Causal Sparse DiT architecture, which leverages specially designed positional encodings, causal sparse attention, and Key-Value Cache to effectively manage long-context references and ensure color identity consistency. Results demonstrate that Cobra achieves accurate line art colorization through extensive contextual reference, significantly enhancing inference speed and interactivity, thereby meeting critical industrial demands. We release our codes and models on our project page:this https URL.

- **[Coding-Prior Guided Diffusion Network for Video Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12222)**  `arXiv:2504.12222`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yike Liu, Jianhui Zhang, Haipeng Li, Shuaicheng Liu, Bing Zeng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While recent video deblurring methods have advanced significantly, they often overlook two valuable prior information: (1) motion vectors (MVs) and coding residuals (CRs) from video codecs, which provide efficient inter-frame alignment cues, and (2) the rich real-world knowledge embedded in pre-trained diffusion generative models. We present CPGDNet, a novel two-stage framework that effectively leverages both coding priors and generative diffusion priors for high-quality deblurring. First, our coding-prior feature propagation (CPFP) module utilizes MVs for efficient frame alignment and CRs to generate attention masks, addressing motion inaccuracies and texture variations. Second, a coding-prior controlled generation (CPC) module network integrates coding priors into a pretrained diffusion model, guiding it to enhance critical regions and synthesize realistic details. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality with up to 30% improvement in IQA metrics. Both the code and the codingprior-augmented dataset will be open-sourced.

  _Songping Wang, Yueming Lyu, Shiqi Liu, Ning Li, Tong Tong, Hao Sun, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rise of customized diffusion models has spurred a boom in personalized visual content creation, but also poses risks of malicious misuse, severely threatening personal privacy and copyright protection. Some studies show that the aesthetic properties of images are highly positively correlated with human perception of image quality. Inspired by this, we approach the problem from a novel and intriguing aesthetic perspective to degrade the generation quality of maliciously customized models, thereby achieving better protection of facial identity. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anti-Aesthetic (HAA) framework to fully explore aesthetic cues, which consists of two key branches: 1) Global Anti-Aesthetics: By establishing a global anti-aesthetic reward mechanism and a global anti-aesthetic loss, it can degrade the overall aesthetics of the generated content; 2) Local Anti-Aesthetics: A local anti-aesthetic reward mechanism and a local anti-aesthetic loss are designed to guide adversarial perturbations to disrupt local facial identity. By seamlessly integrating both branches, our HAA effectively achieves the goal of anti-aesthetics from a global to a local level during customized generation. Extensive experiments show that HAA outperforms existing SOTA methods largely in identity removal, providing a powerful tool for protecting facial privacy and copyright.

- **[Generalized Visual Relation Detection with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12100)**  `arXiv:2504.12100`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual relation detection (VRD) aims to identify relationships (or interactions) between object pairs in an image. Although recent VRD models have achieved impressive performance, they are all restricted to pre-defined relation categories, while failing to consider the semantic ambiguity characteristic of visual relations. Unlike objects, the appearance of visual relations is always subtle and can be described by multiple predicate words from different perspectives, e.g., ``ride'' can be depicted as ``race'' and ``sit on'', from the sports and spatial position views, respectively. To this end, we propose to model visual relations as continuous embeddings, and design diffusion models to achieve generalized VRD in a conditional generative manner, termed Diff-VRD. We model the diffusion process in a latent space and generate all possible relations in the image as an embedding sequence. During the generation, the visual and text embeddings of subject-object pairs serve as conditional signals and are injected via cross-attention. After the generation, we design a subsequent matching stage to assign the relation words to subject-object pairs by considering their semantic similarities. Benefiting from the diffusion-based generative process, our Diff-VRD is able to generate visual relations beyond the pre-defined category labels of datasets. To properly evaluate this generalized VRD task, we introduce two evaluation metrics, i.e., text-to-image retrieval and SPICE PR Curve inspired by image captioning. Extensive experiments in both human-object interaction (HOI) detection and scene graph generation (SGG) benchmarks attest to the superiority and effectiveness of Diff-VRD.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-Video generation, which utilizes the provided text prompt to generate high-quality videos, has drawn increasing attention and achieved great success due to the development of diffusion models recently. Existing methods mainly rely on a pre-trained text encoder to capture the semantic information and perform cross attention with the encoded text prompt to guide the generation of video. However, when it comes to complex prompts that contain dynamic scenes and multiple camera-view transformations, these methods can not decompose the overall information into separate scenes, as well as fail to smoothly change scenes based on the corresponding camera-views. To solve these problems, we propose a novel method, i.e., Modular-Cam. Specifically, to better understand a given complex prompt, we utilize a large language model to analyze user instructions and decouple them into multiple scenes together with transition actions. To generate a video containing dynamic scenes that match the given camera-views, we incorporate the widely-used temporal transformer into the diffusion model to ensure continuity within a single scene and propose CamOperator, a modular network based module that well controls the camera movements. Moreover, we propose AdaControlNet, which utilizes ControlNet to ensure consistency across scenes and adaptively adjusts the color tone of the generated video. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments prove our proposed Modular-Cam's strong capability of generating multi-scene videos together with its ability to achieve fine-grained control of camera movements. Generated results are available atthis https URL.

- **[Understanding Attention Mechanism in Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12027)**  `arXiv:2504.12027`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models, such as OpenAI's Sora, have garnered significant attention due to their ability to generate high-quality videos from a text prompt. In diffusion-based T2V models, the attention mechanism is a critical component. However, it remains unclear what intermediate features are learned and how attention blocks in T2V models affect various aspects of video synthesis, such as image quality and temporal consistency. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth perturbation analysis of the spatial and temporal attention blocks of T2V models using an information-theoretic approach. Our results indicate that temporal and spatial attention maps affect not only the timing and layout of the videos but also the complexity of spatiotemporal elements and the aesthetic quality of the synthesized videos. Notably, high-entropy attention maps are often key elements linked to superior video quality, whereas low-entropy attention maps are associated with the video's intra-frame structure. Based on our findings, we propose two novel methods to enhance video quality and enable text-guided video editing. These methods rely entirely on lightweight manipulation of the attention matrices in T2V models. The efficacy and effectiveness of our methods are further validated through experimental evaluation across multiple datasets.

- **[R-Meshfusion: Reinforcement Learning Powered Sparse-View Mesh Reconstruction with Diffusion Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11946)**  `arXiv:2504.11946`  `cs.CV`  
  _Haoyang Wang, Liming Liu, Peiheng Wang, Junlin Hao, Jiangkai Wu, Xinggong Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mesh reconstruction from multi-view images is a fundamental problem in computer vision, but its performance degrades significantly under sparse-view conditions, especially in unseen regions where no ground-truth observations are available. While recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing novel views from limited inputs, their outputs often suffer from visual artifacts and lack 3D consistency, posing challenges for reliable mesh optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages diffusion models to enhance sparse-view mesh reconstruction in a principled and reliable manner. To address the instability of diffusion outputs, we propose a Consensus Diffusion Module that filters unreliable generations via interquartile range (IQR) analysis and performs variance-aware image fusion to produce robust pseudo-supervision. Building on this, we design an online reinforcement learning strategy based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to adaptively select the most informative viewpoints for enhancement, guided by diffusion loss. Finally, the fused images are used to jointly supervise a NeRF-based model alongside sparse-view ground truth, ensuring consistency across both geometry and appearance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in both geometric quality and rendering quality.

- **[Beyond Words: Augmenting Discriminative Richness via Diffusions in Unsupervised Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11930)**  `arXiv:2504.11930`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hairui Ren, Fan Tang, He Zhao, Zixuan Wang, Dandan Guo, Yi Chang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) with large amounts of unlabeled data has recently garnered significant interest. However, a key challenge remains the lack of high-quality pseudo-labeled data. Current pseudo-labeling strategies often struggle with mismatches between semantic and visual information, leading to sub-optimal performance of unsupervised prompt learning (UPL) methods. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective approach called \textbf{A}ugmenting D\textbf{i}scriminative \textbf{R}ichness via Diffusions (AiR), toward learning a richer discriminating way to represent the class comprehensively and thus facilitate classification. Specifically, our approach includes a pseudo-label generation module that leverages high-fidelity synthetic samples to create an auxiliary classifier, which captures richer visual variation, bridging text-image-pair classification to a more robust image-image-pair classification. Additionally, we exploit the diversity of diffusion-based synthetic samples to enhance prompt learning, providing greater information for semantic-visual alignment. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks, including RESISC45 and Flowers102, and across three learning paradigms-UL, SSL, and TRZSL-demonstrate that AiR achieves substantial and consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art unsupervised prompt learning methods.

  Large text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable image synthesis capabilities, but their indiscriminate training on Internet-scale data has led to learned concepts that enable harmful, copyrighted, or otherwise undesirable content generation. We address the task of concept erasure in diffusion models, i.e., removing a specified concept from a pre-trained model such that prompting the concept (or related synonyms) no longer yields its depiction, while preserving the model's ability to generate other content. We propose a novel method, Attentional Concept Erasure (ACE), that integrates a closed-form attention manipulation with lightweight fine-tuning. Theoretically, we formulate concept erasure as aligning the model's conditional distribution on the target concept with a neutral distribution. Our approach identifies and nullifies concept-specific latent directions in the cross-attention modules via a gated low-rank adaptation, followed by adversarially augmented fine-tuning to ensure thorough erasure of the concept and its synonyms. Empirically, we demonstrate on multiple benchmarks, including object classes, celebrity faces, explicit content, and artistic styles, that ACE achieves state-of-the-art concept removal efficacy and robustness. Compared to prior methods, ACE better balances generality (erasing concept and related terms) and specificity (preserving unrelated content), scales to dozens of concepts, and is efficient, requiring only a few seconds of adaptation per concept. We will release our code to facilitate safer deployment of diffusion models.

  Generating videos in the first-person perspective has broad application prospects in the field of augmented reality and embodied intelligence. In this work, we explore the cross-view video prediction task, where given an exo-centric video, the first frame of the corresponding ego-centric video, and textual instructions, the goal is to generate futur frames of the ego-centric video. Inspired by the notion that hand-object interactions (HOI) in ego-centric videos represent the primary intentions and actions of the current actor, we present EgoExo-Gen that explicitly models the hand-object dynamics for cross-view video prediction. EgoExo-Gen consists of two stages. First, we design a cross-view HOI mask prediction model that anticipates the HOI masks in future ego-frames by modeling the spatio-temporal ego-exo correspondence. Next, we employ a video diffusion model to predict future ego-frames using the first ego-frame and textual instructions, while incorporating the HOI masks as structural guidance to enhance prediction quality. To facilitate training, we develop an automated pipeline to generate pseudo HOI masks for both ego- and exo-videos by exploiting vision foundation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed EgoExo-Gen achieves better prediction performance compared to previous video prediction models on the Ego-Exo4D and H2O benchmark datasets, with the HOI masks significantly improving the generation of hands and interactive objects in the ego-centric videos.

  The application of diffusion models in 3D LiDAR scene completion is limited due to diffusion's slow sampling speed. Score distillation accelerates diffusion sampling but with performance degradation, while post-training with direct policy optimization (DPO) boosts performance using preference data. This paper proposes Distillation-DPO, a novel diffusion distillation framework for LiDAR scene completion with preference aligment. First, the student model generates paired completion scenes with different initial noises. Second, using LiDAR scene evaluation metrics as preference, we construct winning and losing sample pairs. Such construction is reasonable, since most LiDAR scene metrics are informative but non-differentiable to be optimized directly. Third, Distillation-DPO optimizes the student model by exploiting the difference in score functions between the teacher and student models on the paired completion scenes. Such procedure is repeated until convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art LiDAR scene completion diffusion models, Distillation-DPO achieves higher-quality scene completion while accelerating the completion speed by more than 5-fold. Our method is the first to explore adopting preference learning in distillation to the best of our knowledge and provide insights into preference-aligned distillation.

  Single-image 3D scene reconstruction presents significant challenges due to its inherently ill-posed nature and limited input constraints. Recent advances have explored two promising directions: multiview generative models that train on 3D consistent datasets but struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, and 3D scene inpainting and completion frameworks that suffer from cross-view inconsistency and suboptimal error handling, as they depend exclusively on depth data or 3D smoothness, which ultimately degrades output quality and computational performance. Building upon these approaches, we present GaussVideoDreamer, which advances generative multimedia approaches by bridging the gap between image, video, and 3D generation, integrating their strengths through two key innovations: (1) A progressive video inpainting strategy that harnesses temporal coherence for improved multiview consistency and faster convergence. (2) A 3D Gaussian Splatting consistency mask to guide the video diffusion with 3D consistent multiview evidence. Our pipeline combines three core components: a geometry-aware initialization protocol, Inconsistency-Aware Gaussian Splatting, and a progressive video inpainting strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves 32% higher LLaVA-IQA scores and at least 2x speedup compared to existing methods while maintaining robust performance across diverse scenes.

  The oracle bone inscription (OBI) recognition plays a significant role in understanding the history and culture of ancient China. However, the existing OBI datasets suffer from a long-tail distribution problem, leading to biased performance of OBI recognition models across majority and minority classes. With recent advancements in generative models, OBI synthesis-based data augmentation has become a promising avenue to expand the sample size of minority classes. Unfortunately, current OBI datasets lack large-scale structure-aligned image pairs for generative model training. To address these problems, we first present the Oracle-P15K, a structure-aligned OBI dataset for OBI generation and denoising, consisting of 14,542 images infused with domain knowledge from OBI experts. Second, we propose a diffusion model-based pseudo OBI generator, called OBIDiff, to achieve realistic and controllable OBI generation. Given a clean glyph image and a target rubbing-style image, it can effectively transfer the noise style of the original rubbing to the glyph image. Extensive experiments on OBI downstream tasks and user preference studies show the effectiveness of the proposed Oracle-P15K dataset and demonstrate that OBIDiff can accurately preserve inherent glyph structures while transferring authentic rubbing styles effectively.

  Diffusion Transformer (DiT), an emerging diffusion model for visual generation, has demonstrated superior performance but suffers from substantial computational costs. Our investigations reveal that these costs primarily stem from the \emph{static} inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces redundant computation in certain \emph{diffusion timesteps} and \emph{spatial regions}. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose \textbf{Dy}namic \textbf{Di}ffusion \textbf{T}ransformer (DyDiT), an architecture that \emph{dynamically} adjusts its computation along both \emph{timestep} and \emph{spatial} dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a \emph{Timestep-wise Dynamic Width} (TDW) approach that adapts model width conditioned on the generation timesteps. In addition, we design a \emph{Spatial-wise Dynamic Token} (SDT) strategy to avoid redundant computation at unnecessary spatial locations. TDW and SDT can be seamlessly integrated into DiT and significantly accelerates the generation process. Building on these designs, we further enhance DyDiT in three key aspects. First, DyDiT is integrated seamlessly with flow matching-based generation, enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we enhance DyDiT to tackle more complex visual generation tasks, including video generation and text-to-image generation, thereby broadening its real-world applications. Finally, to address the high cost of full fine-tuning and democratize technology access, we investigate the feasibility of training DyDiT in a parameter-efficient manner and introduce timestep-based dynamic LoRA (TD-LoRA). Extensive experiments on diverse visual generation models, including DiT, SiT, Latte, and FLUX, demonstrate the effectiveness of DyDiT.

  In this work, we propose a new diffusion-based method for video frame interpolation (VFI), in the context of traditional hand-made animation. We introduce three main contributions: The first is that we explicitly handle the interpolation time in our model, which we also re-estimate during the training process, to cope with the particularly large variations observed in the animation domain, compared to natural videos; The second is that we adapt and generalize a diffusion scheme called ResShift recently proposed in the super-resolution community to VFI, which allows us to perform a very low number of diffusion steps (in the order of 10) to produce our estimates; The third is that we leverage the stochastic nature of the diffusion process to provide a pixel-wise estimate of the uncertainty on the interpolated frame, which could be useful to anticipate where the model may be wrong. We provide extensive comparisons with respect to state-of-the-art models and show that our model outperforms these models on animation videos. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Generative AI has significantly advanced text-driven image generation, but it still faces challenges in producing outputs that consistently align with evolving user preferences and intents, particularly in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. In this research, We present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework that incorporates human-in-the-loop feedback, utilizing a well-trained reward model specifically designed to closely align with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, the framework applies multiple reward functions (such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback) to refine the diffusion model through LoRA, effectively optimizing image generation based on user input. We also constructed multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and image pairs that well-fit user intent. Experiments show the model achieves 508 wins in human evaluation, outperforming DALL-E 3 (463 wins) and others. It also achieves 3.4 rounds in dialogue efficiency (vs. 13.7 for DALL-E 3) and excels in metrics like LPIPS (0.15) and BLIP (0.59). Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines, with significant improvements in image consistency and alignment with user intent.

  This paper addresses the challenge of text-conditioned streaming motion generation, which requires us to predict the next-step human pose based on variable-length historical motions and incoming texts. Existing methods struggle to achieve streaming motion generation, e.g., diffusion models are constrained by pre-defined motion lengths, while GPT-based methods suffer from delayed response and error accumulation problem due to discretized non-causal tokenization. To solve these problems, we propose MotionStreamer, a novel framework that incorporates a continuous causal latent space into a probabilistic autoregressive model. The continuous latents mitigate information loss caused by discretization and effectively reduce error accumulation during long-term autoregressive generation. In addition, by establishing temporal causal dependencies between current and historical motion latents, our model fully utilizes the available information to achieve accurate online motion decoding. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches while offering more applications, including multi-round generation, long-term generation, and dynamic motion composition.

  Score distillation of 2D diffusion models has proven to be a powerful mechanism to guide 3D optimization, for example enabling text-based 3D generation or single-view reconstruction. A common limitation of existing score distillation formulations, however, is that the outputs of the (mode-seeking) optimization are limited in diversity despite the underlying diffusion model being capable of generating diverse samples. In this work, inspired by the sampling process in denoising diffusion, we propose a score formulation that guides the optimization to follow generation paths defined by random initial seeds, thus ensuring diversity. We then present an approximation to adopt this formulation for scenarios where the optimization may not precisely follow the generation paths (\eg a 3D representation whose renderings evolve in a co-dependent manner). We showcase the applications of our `Diverse Score Distillation' (DSD) formulation across tasks such as 2D optimization, text-based 3D inference, and single-view reconstruction. We also empirically validate DSD against prior score distillation formulations and show that it significantly improves sample diversity while preserving fidelity.

  In this paper, we propose a dual-condition diffusion pre-training model named SignDiff that can generate human sign language speakers from a skeleton pose. SignDiff has a novel Frame Reinforcement Network called FR-Net, similar to dense human pose estimation work, which enhances the correspondence between text lexical symbols and sign language dense pose frames, reduces the occurrence of multiple fingers in the diffusion model. In addition, we propose a new method for American Sign Language Production (ASLP), which can generate ASL skeletal pose videos from text input, integrating two new improved modules and a new loss function to improve the accuracy and quality of sign language skeletal posture and enhance the ability of the model to train on large-scale data. We propose the first baseline for ASL production and report the scores of 17.19 and 12.85 on BLEU-4 on the How2Sign dev/test sets. We evaluated our model on the previous mainstream dataset PHOENIX14T, and the experiments achieved the SOTA results. In addition, our image quality far exceeds all previous results by 10 percentage points in terms of SSIM.

  Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities that benefits from online reinforcement learning (RL). These capabilities have primarily been demonstrated within the left-to-right autoregressive (AR) generation paradigm. In contrast, non-autoregressive paradigms based on diffusion generate text in a coarse-to-fine manner. Although recent diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have achieved competitive language modeling performance compared to their AR counterparts, it remains unclear if dLLMs can also leverage recent advances in LLM reasoning. To this end, we propose d1, a framework to adapt pre-trained masked dLLMs into reasoning models via a combination of supervised finetuning (SFT) and RL. Specifically, we develop and extend techniques to improve reasoning in pretrained dLLMs: (a) we utilize a masked SFT technique to distill knowledge and instill self-improvement behavior directly from existing datasets, and (b) we introduce a novel critic-free, policy-gradient based RL algorithm called diffu-GRPO. Through empirical studies, we investigate the performance of different post-training recipes on multiple mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks. We find that d1 yields the best performance and significantly improves performance of a state-of-the-art dLLM.
