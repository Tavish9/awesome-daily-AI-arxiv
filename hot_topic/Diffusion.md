- **[GWM: Towards Scalable Gaussian World Models for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17600)**  `arXiv:2508.17600`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the inefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model (GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling potential of 3D world model.

- **[MIMIC-D: Multi-modal Imitation for MultI-agent Coordination with Decentralized Diffusion Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14159)**  `arXiv:2509.14159`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As robots become more integrated in society, their ability to coordinate with other robots and humans on multi-modal tasks (those with multiple valid solutions) is crucial. We propose to learn such behaviors from expert demonstrations via imitation learning (IL). However, when expert demonstrations are multi-modal, standard IL approaches can struggle to capture the diverse strategies, hindering effective coordination. Diffusion models are known to be effective at handling complex multi-modal trajectory distributions in single-agent systems. Diffusion models have also excelled in multi-agent scenarios where multi-modality is more common and crucial to learning coordinated behaviors. Typically, diffusion-based approaches require a centralized planner or explicit communication among agents, but this assumption can fail in real-world scenarios where robots must operate independently or with agents like humans that they cannot directly communicate with. Therefore, we propose MIMIC-D, a Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm for multi-modal multi-agent imitation learning using diffusion policies. Agents are trained jointly with full information, but execute policies using only local information to achieve implicit coordination. We demonstrate in both simulation and hardware experiments that our method recovers multi-modal coordination behavior among agents in a variety of tasks and environments, while improving upon state-of-the-art baselines.

- **[FlightDiffusion: Revolutionising Autonomous Drone Training with Diffusion Models Generating FPV Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14082)**  `arXiv:2509.14082`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present FlightDiffusion, a diffusion-model-based framework for training autonomous drones from first-person view (FPV) video. Our model generates realistic video sequences from a single frame, enriched with corresponding action spaces to enable reasoning-driven navigation in dynamic environments. Beyond direct policy learning, FlightDiffusion leverages its generative capabilities to synthesize diverse FPV trajectories and state-action pairs, facilitating the creation of large-scale training datasets without the high cost of real-world data collection. Our evaluation demonstrates that the generated trajectories are physically plausible and executable, with a mean position error of 0.25 m (RMSE 0.28 m) and a mean orientation error of 0.19 rad (RMSE 0.24 rad). This approach enables improved policy learning and dataset scalability, leading to superior performance in downstream navigation tasks. Results in simulated environments highlight enhanced robustness, smoother trajectory planning, and adaptability to unseen conditions. An ANOVA revealed no statistically significant difference between performance in simulation and reality (F(1, 16) = 0.394, p = 0.541), with success rates of M = 0.628 (SD = 0.162) and M = 0.617 (SD = 0.177), respectively, indicating strong sim-to-real transfer. The generated datasets provide a valuable resource for future UAV research. This work introduces diffusion-based reasoning as a promising paradigm for unifying navigation, action generation, and data synthesis in aerial robotics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce PhysicalAgent, an agentic framework for robotic manipulation that integrates iterative reasoning, diffusion-based video generation, and closed-loop execution. Given a textual instruction, our method generates short video demonstrations of candidate trajectories, executes them on the robot, and iteratively re-plans in response to failures. This approach enables robust recovery from execution errors. We evaluate PhysicalAgent across multiple perceptual modalities (egocentric, third-person, and simulated) and robotic embodiments (bimanual UR3, Unitree G1 humanoid, simulated GR1), comparing against state-of-the-art task-specific baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving up to 83% success on human-familiar tasks. Physical trials reveal that first-attempt success is limited (20-30%), yet iterative correction increases overall success to 80% across platforms. These results highlight the potential of video-based generative reasoning for general-purpose robotic manipulation and underscore the importance of iterative execution for recovering from initial failures. Our framework paves the way for scalable, adaptable, and robust robot control.

- **[Hybrid Diffusion Policies with Projective Geometric Algebra for Efficient Robot Manipulation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05695)**  `arXiv:2507.05695`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion policies are a powerful paradigm for robot learning, but their training is often inefficient. A key reason is that networks must relearn fundamental spatial concepts, such as translations and rotations, from scratch for every new task. To alleviate this redundancy, we propose embedding geometric inductive biases directly into the network architecture using Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA). PGA provides a unified algebraic framework for representing geometric primitives and transformations, allowing neural networks to reason about spatial structure more effectively. In this paper, we introduce hPGA-DP, a novel hybrid diffusion policy that capitalizes on these benefits. Our architecture leverages the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr) as a state encoder and action decoder, while employing established U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the core denoising process. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and real-world environments, we demonstrate that hPGA-DP significantly improves task performance and training efficiency. Notably, our hybrid approach achieves substantially faster convergence compared to both standard diffusion policies and architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.

- **[PRISM-DP: Spatial Pose-based Observations for Diffusion-Policies via Segmentation, Mesh Generation, and Pose Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20359)**  `arXiv:2504.20359`  `cs.RO`  
  _Xiatao Sun, Yinxing Chen, Daniel Rakita_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion policies generate robot motions by learning to denoise action-space trajectories conditioned on observations. These observations are commonly streams of RGB images, whose high dimensionality includes substantial task-irrelevant information, requiring large models to extract relevant patterns. In contrast, using structured observations like the spatial poses of key objects enables training more compact policies with fewer parameters. However, obtaining accurate object poses in open-set, real-world environments remains challenging, as 6D pose estimation and tracking methods often depend on markers placed on objects beforehand or pre-scanned object meshes that require manual reconstruction. We propose PRISM-DP, an approach that leverages segmentation, mesh generation, and pose tracking models to enable compact diffusion policy learning directly from the spatial poses of task-relevant objects. Crucially, by using a mesh generation model, PRISM-DP eliminates the need for manual mesh creation, improving scalability in open-set environments. Experiments in simulation and the real world show that PRISM-DP outperforms high-dimensional image-based policies and achieves performance comparable to policies trained with ground-truth state information.

- **[Optimizing Active Perception for Learning Simultaneous Viewpoint Selection and Manipulation with Diffusion Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14615)**  `arXiv:2409.14615`  `cs.RO`  
  _Xiatao Sun, Francis Fan, Yinxing Chen, Daniel Rakita_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic manipulation tasks often rely on static cameras for perception, which can limit flexibility, particularly in scenarios like robotic surgery and cluttered environments where mounting static cameras is impractical. Ideally, robots could jointly learn a policy for dynamic viewpoint and manipulation. However, dynamic viewpoint control requires additional degrees of freedom and intricate coordination with manipulation, which results in more challenging policy learning than single-arm manipulation. To address this complexity, we propose an integrated learning framework that combines diffusion policy with a novel look-at inverse kinematics solver for active perception. Our framework helps better coordinating between perception and manipulation. It automatically optimizes camera orientation for viewpoint selection, while allowing the policy to focus on essential manipulation and positioning decisions. We demonstrate that our integrated approach achieves superior performance and learning efficiency compared to directly applying diffusion policies to configuration space or end-effector space with various rotation representations. Further analysis suggests that these performance differences are driven by inherent variations in the high-frequency components across different state-action spaces.

- **[LLM-I: LLMs are Naturally Interleaved Multimodal Creators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13642)**  `arXiv:2509.13642`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Zirun Guo, Feng Zhang, Kai Jia, Tao Jin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose LLM-Interleaved (LLM-I), a flexible and dynamic framework that reframes interleaved image-text generation as a tool-use problem. LLM-I is designed to overcome the "one-tool" bottleneck of current unified models, which are limited to synthetic imagery and struggle with tasks requiring factual grounding or programmatic precision. Our framework empowers a central LLM or MLLM agent to intelligently orchestrate a diverse toolkit of specialized visual tools, including online image search, diffusion-based generation, code execution, and image editing. The agent is trained to select and apply these tools proficiently via a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that features a hybrid reward system combining rule-based logic with judgments from LLM and MLLM evaluators. Trained on a diverse new dataset using four different model backbones, LLM-I demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by a large margin across four benchmarks. We also introduce a novel test-time scaling strategy that provides further performance gains. Project Page:this https URL.

- **[Masked Diffusion Models as Energy Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13866)**  `arXiv:2509.13866`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Sitong Chen, Shen Nie, Jiacheng Sun, Zijin Feng, Zhenguo Li, Ji-Rong Wen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a systematic theoretical framework that interprets masked diffusion models (MDMs) as solutions to energy minimization problems in discrete optimal transport. Specifically, we prove that three distinct energy formulations--kinetic, conditional kinetic, and geodesic energy--are mathematically equivalent under the structure of MDMs, and that MDMs minimize all three when the mask schedule satisfies a closed-form optimality condition. This unification not only clarifies the theoretical foundations of MDMs, but also motivates practical improvements in sampling. By parameterizing interpolation schedules via Beta distributions, we reduce the schedule design space to a tractable 2D search, enabling efficient post-training tuning without model modification. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our energy-inspired schedules outperform hand-crafted baselines, particularly in low-step sampling settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Decision Transformer (DT), a trajectory modelling method, has shown competitive performance compared to traditional offline reinforcement learning (RL) approaches on various classic control tasks. However, it struggles to learn optimal policies from suboptimal, reward-labelled trajectories. In this study, we explore the use of conditional generative modelling to facilitate trajectory stitching given its high-quality data generation ability. Additionally, recent advancements in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown their linear complexity and competitive sequence modelling performance over Transformers. We leverage the Test-Time Training (TTT) layer, an RNN that updates hidden states during testing, to model trajectories in the form of DT. We introduce a unified framework, called Diffusion-Refined Decision TTT (DRDT3), to achieve performance beyond DT models. Specifically, we propose the Decision TTT (DT3) module, which harnesses the sequence modelling strengths of both self-attention and the TTT layer to capture recent contextual information and make coarse action predictions. DRDT3 iteratively refines the coarse action predictions through the generative diffusion model, progressively moving closer to the optimal actions. We further integrate DT3 with the diffusion model using a unified optimization objective. With experiments on multiple tasks in the D4RL benchmark, our DT3 model without diffusion refinement demonstrates improved performance over standard DT, while DRDT3 further achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art DT-based and offline RL methods.

  Feature caching has recently emerged as a promising method for diffusion model acceleration. It effectively alleviates the inefficiency problem caused by high computational requirements by caching similar features in the inference process of the diffusion model. In this paper, we analyze existing feature caching methods from the perspective of information utilization, and point out that relying solely on historical information will lead to constrained accuracy and speed performance. And we propose a novel paradigm that introduces future information via self-speculation based on the information similarity at the same time step across different iteration times. Based on this paradigm, we present \textit{SpecDiff}, a training-free multi-level feature caching strategy including a cached feature selection algorithm and a multi-level feature classification algorithm. (1) Feature selection algorithm based on self-speculative information. \textit{SpecDiff} determines a dynamic importance score for each token based on self-speculative information and historical information, and performs cached feature selection through the importance score. (2) Multi-level feature classification algorithm based on feature importance scores. \textit{SpecDiff} classifies tokens by leveraging the differences in feature importance scores and introduces a multi-level feature calculation strategy. Extensive experiments show that \textit{SpecDiff} achieves average 2.80 \times, 2.74 \times , and 3.17\times speedup with negligible quality loss in Stable Diffusion 3, 3.5, and FLUX compared to RFlow on NVIDIA A800-80GB GPU. By merging speculative and historical information, \textit{SpecDiff} overcomes the speedup-accuracy trade-off bottleneck, pushing the Pareto frontier of speedup and accuracy in the efficient diffusion model inference.

- **[BiasMap: Leveraging Cross-Attentions to Discover and Mitigate Hidden Social Biases in Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13496)**  `arXiv:2509.13496`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bias discovery is critical for black-box generative models, especiall text-to-image (TTI) models. Existing works predominantly focus on output-level demographic distributions, which do not neces- sarily guarantee concept representations to be disentangled post- mitigation. We propose BiasMap, a model-agnostic framework for uncovering latent concept-level representational biases in stable dif- fusion models. BiasMap leverages cross-attention attribution maps to reveal structural entanglements between demographics (e.g., gender, race) and semantics (e.g., professions), going deeper into representational bias during the image generation. Using attribu- tion maps of these concepts, we quantify the spatial demographics- semantics concept entanglement via Intersection over Union (IoU), offering a lens into bias that remains hidden in existing fairness dis- covery approaches. In addition, we further utilize BiasMap for bias mitigation through energy-guided diffusion sampling that directly modifies latent noise space and minimizes the expected SoftIoU dur- ing the denoising process. Our findings show that existing fairness interventions may reduce the output distributional gap but often fail to disentangle concept-level coupling, whereas our mitigation method can mitigate concept entanglement in image generation while complementing distributional bias mitigation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Three-dimensional (3D) scene understanding in colonoscopy presents significant challenges that necessitate automated methods for accurate depth estimation. However, existing depth estimation models for endoscopy struggle with temporal consistency across video sequences, limiting their applicability for 3D reconstruction. We present ColonCrafter, a diffusion-based depth estimation model that generates temporally consistent depth maps from monocular colonoscopy videos. Our approach learns robust geometric priors from synthetic colonoscopy sequences to generate temporally consistent depth maps. We also introduce a style transfer technique that preserves geometric structure while adapting real clinical videos to match our synthetic training domain. ColonCrafter achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the C3VD dataset, outperforming both general-purpose and endoscopy-specific approaches. Although full trajectory 3D reconstruction remains a challenge, we demonstrate clinically relevant applications of ColonCrafter, including 3D point cloud generation and surface coverage assessment.

  Instruction-based image editing has advanced rapidly, yet reliable and interpretable evaluation remains a bottleneck. Current protocols either (i) depend on paired reference images -- resulting in limited coverage and inheriting biases from prior generative models -- or (ii) rely solely on zero-shot vision--language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often imprecise.To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated, scalable, and fine-grained evaluation framework for multi-turn instruction-based editing from an object-centric perspective, supported by a suite of expert tools. Given an image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects, then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions. For evaluation, it integrates VLMs with open-vocabulary object detectors to assess instruction following, uses semantic-level feature extractors to evaluate content consistency, and leverages human preference models to judge visual quality. We show that combining VLMs with object detectors yields stronger agreement with human judgments in instruction-following evaluation compared to using VLMs alone and CLIP-based metrics. Furthermore, the pipeline's modular design allows future tools to be seamlessly integrated, enhancing evaluation accuracy over time.Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 11 state-of-the-art editing models spanning autoregressive (AR) (including Nano Banana, GPT-Image-1), flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be used to identify existing failure modes, thereby informing the development of the next generation of editing models. Project page:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have established them as the state-of-the-art method for video generation. However, their inherently sequential denoising process results in inevitable latency, limiting real-world applicability. Existing acceleration methods either compromise visual quality due to architectural modifications or fail to reuse intermediate features at proper granularity. Our analysis reveals that DiT blocks are the primary contributors to inference latency. Across diffusion timesteps, the feature variations of DiT blocks exhibit a U-shaped pattern with high similarity during intermediate timesteps, which suggests substantial computational redundancy. In this paper, we propose Block-Wise Caching (BWCache), a training-free method to accelerate DiT-based video generation. BWCache dynamically caches and reuses features from DiT blocks across diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce a similarity indicator that triggers feature reuse only when the differences between block features at adjacent timesteps fall below a threshold, thereby minimizing redundant computations while maintaining visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on several video diffusion models demonstrate that BWCache achieves up to 2.24$\times$ speedup with comparable visual quality.

  Fashion image editing is a crucial tool for designers to convey their creative ideas by visualizing design concepts interactively. Current fashion image editing techniques, though advanced with multimodal prompts and powerful diffusion models, often struggle to accurately identify editing regions and preserve the desired garment texture detail. To address these challenges, we introduce a new multimodal fashion image editing architecture based on latent diffusion models, called Detail-Preserved Diffusion Models (DPDEdit). DPDEdit guides the fashion image generation of diffusion models by integrating text prompts, region masks, human pose images, and garment texture images. To precisely locate the editing region, we first introduce Grounded-SAM to predict the editing region based on the user's textual description, and then combine it with other conditions to perform local editing. To transfer the detail of the given garment texture into the target fashion image, we propose a texture injection and refinement mechanism. Specifically, this mechanism employs a decoupled cross-attention layer to integrate textual descriptions and texture images, and incorporates an auxiliary U-Net to preserve the high-frequency details of generated garment texture. Additionally, we extend the VITON-HD dataset using a multimodal large language model to generate paired samples with texture images and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our DPDEdit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of image fidelity and coherence with the given multimodal inputs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art image generation. However, the random Gaussian noise used to start the diffusion process influences the final output, causing variations in image quality and prompt adherence. Existing noise-level optimization approaches generally rely on extra dataset construction, additional networks, or backpropagation-based optimization, limiting their practicality. In this paper, we propose Noise Level Guidance (NLG), a simple, efficient, and general noise-level optimization approach that refines initial noise by increasing the likelihood of its alignment with general guidance - requiring no additional training data, auxiliary networks, or backpropagation. The proposed NLG approach provides a unified framework generalizable to both conditional and unconditional diffusion models, accommodating various forms of diffusion-level guidance. Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach enhances output generation quality and input condition adherence. By seamlessly integrating with existing guidance methods while maintaining computational efficiency, our method establishes NLG as a practical and scalable enhancement to diffusion models.

- **[Towards Robust Defense against Customization via Protective Perturbation Resistant to Diffusion-based Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13922)**  `arXiv:2509.13922`  `cs.CV`  
  _Wenkui Yang, Jie Cao, Junxian Duan, Ran He_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have become prominent in visual synthesis tasks due to their powerful customization capabilities, which also introduce significant security risks, including deepfakes and copyright infringement. In response, a class of methods known as protective perturbation emerged, which mitigates image misuse by injecting imperceptible adversarial noise. However, purification can remove protective perturbations, thereby exposing images again to the risk of malicious forgery. In this work, we formalize the anti-purification task, highlighting challenges that hinder existing approaches, and propose a simple diagnostic protective perturbation named AntiPure. AntiPure exposes vulnerabilities of purification within the "purification-customization" workflow, owing to two guidance mechanisms: 1) Patch-wise Frequency Guidance, which reduces the model's influence over high-frequency components in the purified image, and 2) Erroneous Timestep Guidance, which disrupts the model's denoising strategy across different timesteps. With additional guidance, AntiPure embeds imperceptible perturbations that persist under representative purification settings, achieving effective post-customization distortion. Experiments show that, as a stress test for purification, AntiPure achieves minimal perceptual discrepancy and maximal distortion, outperforming other protective perturbation methods within the purification-customization workflow.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a compact dataset from the original large-scale one, enabling highly efficient learning while preserving competitive model performance. However, traditional techniques primarily capture low-level visual features, neglecting the high-level semantic and structural information inherent in images. In this paper, we propose EDITS, a novel framework that exploits the implicit textual semantics within the image data to achieve enhanced distillation. First, external texts generated by a Vision Language Model (VLM) are fused with image features through a Global Semantic Query module, forming the prior clustered buffer. Local Semantic Awareness then selects representative samples from the buffer to construct image and text prototypes, with the latter produced by guiding a Large Language Model (LLM) with meticulously crafted prompt. Ultimately, Dual Prototype Guidance strategy generates the final synthetic dataset through a diffusion model. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of ourthis http URLcode is available in:this https URL.

- **[Generative Image Coding with Diffusion Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13768)**  `arXiv:2509.13768`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jianhui Chang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As generative technologies advance, visual content has evolved into a complex mix of natural and AI-generated images, driving the need for more efficient coding techniques that prioritize perceptual quality. Traditional codecs and learned methods struggle to maintain subjective quality at high compression ratios, while existing generative approaches face challenges in visual fidelity and generalization. To this end, we propose a novel generative coding framework leveraging diffusion priors to enhance compression performance at low bitrates. Our approach employs a pre-optimized encoder to generate generalized compressed-domain representations, integrated with the pretrained model's internal features via a lightweight adapter and an attentive fusion module. This framework effectively leverages existing pretrained diffusion models and enables efficient adaptation to different pretrained models for new requirements with minimal retraining costs. We also introduce a distribution renormalization method to further enhance reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments show that our method (1) outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity across low bitrates, (2) improves compression performance by up to 79% over H.266/VVC, and (3) offers an efficient solution for AI-generated content while being adaptable to broader content types.

- **[Controllable-Continuous Color Editing in Diffusion Model via Color Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13756)**  `arXiv:2509.13756`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yuqi Yang, Dongliang Chang, Yuanchen Fang, Yi-Zhe SonG, Zhanyu Ma, Jun Guo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, text-driven image editing has made significant progress. However, due to the inherent ambiguity and discreteness of natural language, color editing still faces challenges such as insufficient precision and difficulty in achieving continuous control. Although linearly interpolating the embedding vectors of different textual descriptions can guide the model to generate a sequence of images with varying colors, this approach lacks precise control over the range of color changes in the output images. Moreover, the relationship between the interpolation coefficient and the resulting image color is unknown and uncontrollable. To address these issues, we introduce a color mapping module that explicitly models the correspondence between the text embedding space and image RGB values. This module predicts the corresponding embedding vector based on a given RGB value, enabling precise color control of the generated images while maintaining semantic consistency. Users can specify a target RGB range to generate images with continuous color variations within the desired range, thereby achieving finer-grained, continuous, and controllable color editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method performs well in terms of color continuity and controllability.

- **[StyleProtect: Safeguarding Artistic Identity in Fine-tuned Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13711)**  `arXiv:2509.13711`  `cs.CV`  
  _Qiuyu Tang, Joshua Krinsky, Aparna Bharati_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of generative models, particularly diffusion-based approaches, has inadvertently facilitated their potential for misuse. Such models enable malicious exploiters to replicate artistic styles that capture an artist's creative labor, personal vision, and years of dedication in an inexpensive manner. This has led to a rise in the need and exploration of methods for protecting artworks against style mimicry. Although generic diffusion models can easily mimic an artistic style, finetuning amplifies this capability, enabling the model to internalize and reproduce the style with higher fidelity and control. We hypothesize that certain cross-attention layers exhibit heightened sensitivity to artistic styles. Sensitivity is measured through activation strengths of attention layers in response to style and content representations, and assessing their correlations with features extracted from external models. Based on our findings, we introduce an efficient and lightweight protection strategy, StyleProtect, that achieves effective style defense against fine-tuned diffusion models by updating only selected cross-attention layers.

  Diffusion models enable high-quality virtual try-on (VTO) with their established image synthesis abilities. Despite the extensive end-to-end training of large pre-trained models involved in current VTO methods, real-world applications often prioritize limited training and inference, serving, and deployment budgets for VTO. To solve this obstacle, we apply Doob's h-transform efficient fine-tuning (DEFT) for adapting large pre-trained unconditional models for downstream image-conditioned VTO abilities. DEFT freezes the pre-trained model's parameters and trains a small h-transform network to learn a conditional h-transform. The h-transform network allows training only 1.42 percent of the frozen parameters, compared to a baseline of 5.52 percent in traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).To further improve DEFT's performance and decrease existing models' inference time, we additionally propose an adaptive consistency loss. Consistency training distills slow but high-performing diffusion models into a fast one while retaining performance by enforcing consistencies along the inference path. Inspired by constrained optimization, instead of distillation, we combine the consistency loss and the denoising score matching loss in a data-adaptive manner for fine-tuning existing VTO models at a low cost. Empirical results show the proposed DEFT-VTON method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VTO tasks, with as few as 15 denoising steps, while maintaining competitive results.

  Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in few-step video generation.

  Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to remarkable success across a wide range of tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations remains a critical vulnerability. Existing diffusion-based adversarial purification methods often require intensive iterative denoising, severely limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose Diffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP), a novel and efficient diffusion-based framework for adversarial purification. Central to our approach is a new objective, noise bridge distillation, which constructs a principled alignment between the adversarial noise distribution and the clean data distribution within a latent consistency model (LCM). To further enhance semantic fidelity, we introduce adaptive semantic enhancement, which fuses multi-scale pyramid edge maps as conditioning input to guide the purification process. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DBLP achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust accuracy, superior image quality, and around 0.2s inference time, marking a significant step toward real-time adversarial purification.

  Estimated brain age from magnetic resonance image (MRI) and its deviation from chronological age can provide early insights into potential neurodegenerative diseases, supporting early detection and implementation of prevention strategies. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) presents an opportunity to build an earlier biomarker for neurodegenerative disease prediction because it captures subtle microstructural changes that precede more perceptible macrostructural changes. However, the coexistence of macro- and micro-structural information in dMRI raises the question of whether current dMRI-based brain age estimation models are leveraging the intended microstructural information or if they inadvertently rely on the macrostructural information. To develop a microstructure-specific brain age, we propose a method for brain age identification from dMRI that mitigates the model's use of macrostructural information by non-rigidly registering all images to a standard template. Imaging data from 13,398 participants across 12 datasets were used for the training and evaluation. We compare our brain age models, trained with and without macrostructural information mitigated, with an architecturally similar T1-weighted (T1w) MRI-based brain age model and two recent, popular, openly available T1w MRI-based brain age models that primarily use macrostructural information. We observe difference between our dMRI-based brain age and T1w MRI-based brain age across stages of neurodegeneration, with dMRI-based brain age being older than T1w MRI-based brain age in participants transitioning from cognitively normal (CN) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but younger in participants already diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, dMRI-based brain age may offer advantages over T1w MRI-based brain age in predicting the transition from CN to MCI up to five years before diagnosis.
