- **[DECO: Decoupled Multimodal Diffusion Transformer for Bimanual Dexterous Manipulation with a Plugin Tactile Adapter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05513)**  `arXiv:2602.05513`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Bimanual dexterous manipulation relies on integrating multimodal inputs to perform complex real-world tasks. To address the challenges of effectively combining these modalities, we propose DECO, a decoupled multimodal diffusion transformer that disentangles vision, proprioception, and tactile signals through specialized conditioning pathways, enabling structured and controllable integration of multimodal inputs, with a lightweight adapter for parameter-efficient injection of additional signals. Alongside DECO, we release DECO-50 dataset for bimanual dexterous manipulation with tactile sensing, consisting of 50 hours of data and over 5M frames, collected via teleoperation on real dual-arm robots. We train DECO on DECO-50 and conduct extensive real-world evaluation with over 2,000 robot rollouts. Experimental results show that DECO achieves the best performance across all tasks, with a 72.25% average success rate and a 21% improvement over the baseline. Moreover, the tactile adapter brings an additional 10.25% average success rate across all tasks and a 20% gain on complex contact-rich tasks while tuning less than 10% of the model parameters.

- **[Bridging Dynamics Gaps via Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge for Cross-Domain Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23737)**  `arXiv:2602.23737`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Hanping Zhang, Yuhong Guo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cross-domain reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn transferable policies under dynamics shifts between source and target domains. A key challenge lies in the lack of target-domain environment interaction and reward supervision, which prevents direct policy learning. To address this challenge, we propose Bridging Dynamics Gaps for Cross-Domain Reinforcement Learning (BDGxRL), a novel framework that leverages Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge (DSB) to align source transitions with target-domain dynamics encoded in offline demonstrations. Moreover, we introduce a reward modulation mechanism that estimates rewards based on state transitions, applying to DSB-aligned samples to ensure consistency between rewards and target-domain dynamics. BDGxRL performs target-oriented policy learning entirely within the source domain, without access to the target environment or its rewards. Experiments on MuJoCo cross-domain benchmarks demonstrate that BDGxRL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and shows strong adaptability under transition dynamics shifts.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) generation, yet their reliance on Transformer backbones limits inference efficiency due to quadratic attention or KV-cache overhead. We introduce DiffuMamba, a masked diffusion language model built on a bidirectional Mamba backbone that combines the diffusion objective with linear-time sequence modeling, and DiffuMamba-H, a hybrid variant with interleaved attention. Across scales up to 1.3B parameters, our models match Transformer-based diffusion in downstream performance while achieving up to 8.2x and 4.3x higher inference throughput, respectively, on long sequences. We further present a systematic analysis of inference efficiency across modern DLM variants combining asymptotic complexity with empirical measurements. Notably, cache-efficient block diffusion with Mamba mixers emerges as the only strategy that scales linearly with sequence length and achieves the strongest performance across all baselines, suggesting a promising direction for future diffusion-based generation systems.

  Generative models, especially diffusion and flow-based models, have been promising in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, integrating powerful generative models into this framework poses unique challenges. In particular, diffusion and flow-based policies suffer from low sampling efficiency due to their iterative generation processes, making them impractical in time-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. To tackle these difficulties, we propose OM2P (Offline Multi-Agent Mean-Flow Policy), a novel offline MARL algorithm to achieve efficient one-step action sampling. To address the misalignment between generative objectives and reward maximization, we introduce a reward-aware optimization scheme that integrates a carefully-designed mean-flow matching loss with Q-function supervision. Additionally, we design a generalized timestep distribution and a derivative-free estimation strategy to reduce memory overhead and improve training stability. Empirical evaluations on Multi-Agent Particle and MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate that OM2P achieves superior performance, with up to a 3.8x reduction in GPU memory usage and up to a 10.8x speed-up in training time. Our approach represents the first to successfully integrate mean-flow model into offline MARL, paving the way for practical and scalable generative policies in cooperative multi-agent settings.

- **[Learning Generation Orders for Masked Discrete Diffusion Models via Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23968)**  `arXiv:2602.23968`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Masked discrete diffusion models (MDMs) are a promising new approach to generative modelling, offering the ability for parallel token generation and therefore greater efficiency than autoregressive counterparts. However, achieving an optimal balance between parallel generation and sample quality remains an open problem. Current approaches primarily address this issue through fixed, heuristic parallel sampling methods. There exist some recent learning based approaches to this problem, but its formulation from the perspective of variational inference remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a variational inference framework for learning parallel generation orders for MDMs. As part of our method, we propose a parameterisation for the approximate posterior of generation orders which facilitates parallelism and efficient sampling during training. Using this method, we conduct preliminary experiments on the GSM8K dataset, where our method performs competitively against heuristic sampling strategies in the regime of highly parallel generation. For example, our method achieves 33.1\% accuracy with an average of only only 4 generation steps, compared to 23.7-29.0\% accuracy achieved by standard competitor methods in the same number of steps. We believe further experiments and analysis of the method will yield valuable insights into the problem of parallel generation with MDMs.

- **[Selective Denoising Diffusion Model for Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23662)**  `arXiv:2602.23662`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) has been an important area of research for decades, with reconstruction-based methods, mostly based on generative models, gaining popularity and demonstrating success. Diffusion models have recently attracted attention due to their advanced generative capabilities. Existing diffusion-based methods for TSAD rely on a conditional strategy, which reconstructs input instances from white noise with the aid of the conditioner. However, this poses challenges in accurately reconstructing the normal parts, resulting in suboptimal detection performance. In response, we propose a novel diffusion-based method, named AnomalyFilter, which acts as a selective filter that only denoises anomaly parts in the instance while retaining normal parts. To build such a filter, we mask Gaussian noise during the training phase and conduct the denoising process without adding noise to the instances. The synergy of the two simple components greatly enhances the performance of naive diffusion models. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that AnomalyFilter achieves notably low reconstruction error on normal parts, providing empirical support for its effectiveness in anomaly detection. AnomalyFilter represents a pioneering approach that focuses on the noise design of diffusion models specifically tailored for TSAD.

- **[Quant VideoGen: Auto-Regressive Long Video Generation via 2-Bit KV-Cache Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02958)**  `arXiv:2602.02958`  `cs.LG`  
  _Haocheng Xi, Shuo Yang, Yilong Zhao, Muyang Li, Han Cai, Xingyang Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite rapid progress in autoregressive video diffusion, an emerging system algorithm bottleneck limits both deployability and generation capability: KV cache memory. In autoregressive video generation models, the KV cache grows with generation history and quickly dominates GPU memory, often exceeding 30 GB, preventing deployment on widely available hardware. More critically, constrained KV cache budgets restrict the effective working memory, directly degrading long horizon consistency in identity, layout, and motion. To address this challenge, we present Quant VideoGen (QVG), a training free KV cache quantization framework for autoregressive video diffusion models. QVG leverages video spatiotemporal redundancy through Semantic Aware Smoothing, producing low magnitude, quantization friendly residuals. It further introduces Progressive Residual Quantization, a coarse to fine multi stage scheme that reduces quantization error while enabling a smooth quality memory trade off. Across LongCat Video, HY WorldPlay, and Self Forcing benchmarks, QVG establishes a new Pareto frontier between quality and memory efficiency, reducing KV cache memory by up to 7.0 times with less than 4% end to end latency overhead while consistently outperforming existing baselines in generation quality.

- **[Mode Seeking meets Mean Seeking for Fast Long Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24289)**  `arXiv:2602.24289`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Shengqu Cai, Weili Nie, Chao Liu, Julius Berner, Lvmin Zhang, Nanye Ma, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scaling video generation from seconds to minutes faces a critical bottleneck: while short-video data is abundant and high-fidelity, coherent long-form data is scarce and limited to narrow domains. To address this, we propose a training paradigm where Mode Seeking meets Mean Seeking, decoupling local fidelity from long-term coherence based on a unified representation via a Decoupled Diffusion Transformer. Our approach utilizes a global Flow Matching head trained via supervised learning on long videos to capture narrative structure, while simultaneously employing a local Distribution Matching head that aligns sliding windows to a frozen short-video teacher via a mode-seeking reverse-KL divergence. This strategy enables the synthesis of minute-scale videos that learns long-range coherence and motions from limited long videos via supervised flow matching, while inheriting local realism by aligning every sliding-window segment of the student to a frozen short-video teacher, resulting in a few-step fast long video generator. Evaluations show that our method effectively closes the fidelity-horizon gap by jointly improving local sharpness, motion and long-range consistency. Project website:this https URL.

- **[SenCache: Accelerating Diffusion Model Inference via Sensitivity-Aware Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24208)**  `arXiv:2602.24208`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Yasaman Haghighi, Alexandre Alahi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art video generation quality, but their inference remains expensive due to the large number of sequential denoising steps. This has motivated a growing line of research on accelerating diffusion inference. Among training-free acceleration methods, caching reduces computation by reusing previously computed model outputs across timesteps. Existing caching methods rely on heuristic criteria to choose cache/reuse timesteps and require extensive tuning. We address this limitation with a principled sensitivity-aware caching framework. Specifically, we formalize the caching error through an analysis of the model output sensitivity to perturbations in the denoising inputs, i.e., the noisy latent and the timestep, and show that this sensitivity is a key predictor of caching error. Based on this analysis, we propose Sensitivity-Aware Caching (SenCache), a dynamic caching policy that adaptively selects caching timesteps on a per-sample basis. Our framework provides a theoretical basis for adaptive caching, explains why prior empirical heuristics can be partially effective, and extends them to a dynamic, sample-specific approach. Experiments on Wan 2.1, CogVideoX, and LTX-Video show that SenCache achieves better visual quality than existing caching methods under similar computational budgets.

- **[DiffusionHarmonizer: Bridging Neural Reconstruction and Photorealistic Simulation with Online Diffusion Enhancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24096)**  `arXiv:2602.24096`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Yuxuan Zhang, Katarína Tóthová, Zian Wang, Kangxue Yin, Haithem Turki, Riccardo de Lutio, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Simulation is essential to the development and evaluation of autonomous robots such as self-driving vehicles. Neural reconstruction is emerging as a promising solution as it enables simulating a wide variety of scenarios from real-world data alone in an automated and scalable way. However, while methods such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting can produce visually compelling results, they often exhibit artifacts particularly when rendering novel views, and fail to realistically integrate inserted dynamic objects, especially when they were captured from different scenes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DiffusionHarmonizer, an online generative enhancement framework that transforms renderings from such imperfect scenes into temporally consistent outputs while improving their realism. At its core is a single-step temporally-conditioned enhancer that is converted from a pretrained multi-step image diffusion model, capable of running in online simulators on a single GPU. The key to training it effectively is a custom data curation pipeline that constructs synthetic-real pairs emphasizing appearance harmonization, artifact correction, and lighting realism. The result is a scalable system that significantly elevates simulation fidelity in both research and production environments.

- **[Spread them Apart: Towards Robust Watermarking of Generated Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07845)**  `arXiv:2502.07845`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Mikhail Pautov, Danil Ivanov, Andrey V. Galichin, Oleg Rogov, Ivan Oseledets_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative models that can produce realistic images have improved significantly in recent years. The quality of the generated content has increased drastically, so sometimes it is very difficult to distinguish between the real images and the generated ones. Such an improvement comes at a price of ethical concerns about the usage of the generative models: the users of generative models can improperly claim ownership of the generated content protected by a license. In this paper, we propose an approach to embed watermarks into the generated content to allow future detection of the generated content and identification of the user who generated it. The watermark is embedded during the inference of the model, so the proposed approach does not require the retraining of the latter. We prove that watermarks embedded are guaranteed to be robust against additive perturbations of a bounded magnitude. We apply our method to watermark diffusion models and show that it matches state-of-the-art watermarking schemes in terms of robustness to different types of synthetic watermark removal attacks.

- **[Joint Geometric and Trajectory Consistency Learning for One-Step Real-World Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24240)**  `arXiv:2602.24240`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chengyan Deng, Zhangquan Chen, Li Yu, Kai Zhang, Xue Zhou, Wang Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) achieves impressive perceptual quality but suffers from high computational costs due to iterative sampling. While recent distillation approaches leveraging large-scale Text-to-Image (T2I) priors have enabled one-step generation, they are typically hindered by prohibitive parameter counts and the inherent capability bounds imposed by teacher models. As a lightweight alternative, Consistency Models offer efficient inference but struggle with two critical limitations: the accumulation of consistency drift inherent to transitive training, and a phenomenon we term "Geometric Decoupling" - where the generative trajectory achieves pixel-wise alignment yet fails to preserve structural coherence. To address these challenges, we propose GTASR (Geometric Trajectory Alignment Super-Resolution), a simple yet effective consistency training paradigm for Real-ISR. Specifically, we introduce a Trajectory Alignment (TA) strategy to rectify the tangent vector field via full-path projection, and a Dual-Reference Structural Rectification (DRSR) mechanism to enforce strict structural constraints. Extensive experiments verify that GTASR delivers superior performance over representative baselines while maintaining minimal latency. The code and model will be released atthis https URL.

- **[GeoDiff4D: Geometry-Aware Diffusion for 4D Head Avatar Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24161)**  `arXiv:2602.24161`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chao Xu, Xiaochen Zhao, Xiang Deng, Jingxiang Sun, Zhuo Su, Donglin Di, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing photorealistic and animatable 4D head avatars from a single portrait image remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. While diffusion models have enabled remarkable progress in image and video generation for avatar reconstruction, existing methods primarily rely on 2D priors and struggle to achieve consistent 3D geometry. We propose a novel framework that leverages geometry-aware diffusion to learn strong geometry priors for high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction. Our approach jointly synthesizes portrait images and corresponding surface normals, while a pose-free expression encoder captures implicit expression representations. Both synthesized images and expression latents are incorporated into 3D Gaussian-based avatars, enabling photorealistic rendering with accurate geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality, expression fidelity, and cross-identity generalization, while supporting real-time rendering.

  _Keito Suzuki, Kunyao Chen, Lei Wang, Bang Du, Runfa Blark Li, Peng Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a method for generating a full 360° orbit video around a person from a single input image. Existing methods typically adapt image-based diffusion models for multi-view synthesis, but yield inconsistent results across views and with the original identity. In contrast, recent video diffusion models have demonstrated their ability in generating photorealistic results that align well with the given prompts. Inspired by these results, we propose HumanOrbit, a video diffusion model for multi-view human image generation. Our approach enables the model to synthesize continuous camera rotations around the subject, producing geometrically consistent novel views while preserving the appearance and identity of the person. Using the generated multi-view frames, we further propose a reconstruction pipeline that recovers a textured mesh of the subject. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of HumanOrbit for multi-view image generation and that the reconstructed 3D models exhibit superior completeness and fidelity compared to those from state-of-the-art baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing 3D clothed humans from monocular images and videos is a fundamental problem with applications in virtual try-on, avatar creation, and mixed reality. Despite significant progress in human body recovery, accurately reconstructing garment geometry, particularly for loose-fitting clothing, remains an open challenge. We propose a unified framework for high-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction from both single images and video sequences. Our approach combines Implicit Sewing Patterns (ISP) with a generative diffusion model to learn expressive garment shape priors in 2D UV space. Leveraging these priors, we introduce a mapping model that establishes correspondences between image pixels, UV pattern coordinates, and 3D geometry, enabling accurate and detailed garment reconstruction from single images. We further extend this formulation to dynamic reconstruction by introducing a spatio-temporal diffusion scheme with test-time guidance to enforce long-range temporal consistency. We also develop analytic projection-based constraints that preserve image-aligned geometry in visible regions while enforcing coherent completion in occluded areas over time. Although trained exclusively on synthetically simulated cloth data, our method generalizes well to real-world imagery and consistently outperforms existing approaches on both tight- and loose-fitting garments. The reconstructed garments preserve fine geometric detail while exhibiting realistic dynamic motion, supporting downstream applications such as texture editing, garment retargeting, and animation.

- **[Ordinal Diffusion Models for Color Fundus Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24013)**  `arXiv:2602.24013`  `cs.CV`  
  _Gustav Schmidt, Philipp Berens, Sarah Müller_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  It has been suggested that generative image models such as diffusion models can improve performance on clinically relevant tasks by offering deep learning models supplementary training data. However, most conditional diffusion models treat disease stages as independent classes, ignoring the continuous nature of disease progression. This mismatch is problematic in medical imaging because continuous pathological processes are typically only observed through coarse, discrete but ordered labels as in ophthalmology for diabetic retinopathy (DR). We propose an ordinal latent diffusion model for generating color fundus images that explicitly incorporates the ordered structure of DR severity into the generation process. Instead of categorical conditioning, we used a scalar disease representation, enabling a smooth transition between adjacent stages. We evaluated our approach using visual realism metrics and classification-based clinical consistency analysis on the EyePACS dataset. Compared to a standard conditional diffusion model, our model reduced the Fréchet inception distance for four of the five DR stages and increased the quadratic weighted $\kappa$ from 0.79 to 0.87. Furthermore, interpolation experiments showed that the model captured a continuous spectrum of disease progression learned from ordered, coarse class labels.

- **[SwitchCraft: Training-Free Multi-Event Video Generation with Attention Controls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23956)**  `arXiv:2602.23956`  `cs.CV`  
  _Qianxun Xu, Chenxi Song, Yujun Cai, Chi Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity and temporally coherent videos synthesis. However, current models are predominantly optimized for single-event generation. When handling multi-event prompts, without explicit temporal grounding, such models often produce blended or collapsed scenes that break the intended narrative. To address this limitation, we present SwitchCraft, a training-free framework for multi-event video generation. Our key insight is that uniform prompt injection across time ignores the correspondence between events and frames. To this end, we introduce Event-Aligned Query Steering (EAQS), which steers frame-level attention to align with relevant event prompts. Furthermore, we propose Auto-Balance Strength Solver (ABSS), which adaptively balances steering strength to preserve temporal consistency and visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SwitchCraft substantially improves prompt alignment, event clarity, and scene consistency compared with existing baselines, offering a simple yet effective solution for multi-event video generation.

- **[Action-Geometry Prediction with 3D Geometric Prior for Bimanual Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23814)**  `arXiv:2602.23814`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chongyang Xu, Haipeng Li, Shen Cheng, Jingyu Hu, Haoqiang Fan, Ziliang Feng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bimanual manipulation requires policies that can reason about 3D geometry, anticipate how it evolves under action, and generate smooth, coordinated motions. However, existing methods typically rely on 2D features with limited spatial awareness, or require explicit point clouds that are difficult to obtain reliably in real-world settings. At the same time, recent 3D geometric foundation models show that accurate and diverse 3D structure can be reconstructed directly from RGB images in a fast and robust manner. We leverage this opportunity and propose a framework that builds bimanual manipulation directly on a pre-trained 3D geometric foundation model. Our policy fuses geometry-aware latents, 2D semantic features, and proprioception into a unified state representation, and uses diffusion model to jointly predict a future action chunk and a future 3D latent that decodes into a dense pointmap. By explicitly predicting how the 3D scene will evolve together with the action sequence, the policy gains strong spatial understanding and predictive capability using only RGB observations. We evaluate our method both in simulation on the RoboTwin benchmark and in real-world robot executions. Our approach consistently outperforms 2D-based and point-cloud-based baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance in manipulation success, inter-arm coordination, and 3D spatial prediction accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models lack an efficient mechanism for early quality assessment, leading to costly trial-and-error in multi-generation scenarios such as prompt iteration, agent-based generation, and flow-grpo. We reveal a strong correlation between early diffusion cross-attention distributions and final image quality. Based on this finding, we introduce Diffusion Probe, a framework that leverages internal cross-attention maps as predictive signals.We design a lightweight predictor that maps statistical properties of early-stage cross-attention extracted from initial denoising steps to the final image's overall quality. This enables accurate forecasting of image quality across diverse evaluation metrics long before full synthesis is complete.We validate Diffusion Probe across a wide range of settings. On multiple T2I models, across early denoising windows, resolutions, and quality metrics, it achieves strong correlation (PCC > 0.7) and high classification performance (AUC-ROC > 0.9).Its reliability translates into practical gains. By enabling early quality-aware decisions in workflows such as prompt optimization, seed selection, and accelerated RL training, the probe supports more targeted sampling and avoids computation on low-potential generations. This reduces computational overhead while improving final output quality.Diffusion Probe is model-agnostic, efficient, and broadly applicable, offering a practical solution for improving T2I generation efficiency through early quality prediction.

- **[A Difference-in-Difference Approach to Detecting AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23732)**  `arXiv:2602.23732`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xinyi Qi, Kai Ye, Chengchun Shi, Ying Yang, Hongyi Zhou, Jin Zhu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models are able to produce AI-generated images that are almost indistinguishable from real ones. This raises concerns about their potential misuse and poses substantial challenges for detecting them. Many existing detectors rely on reconstruction error -- the difference between the input image and its reconstructed version -- as the basis for distinguishing real from fake images. However, these detectors become less effective as modern AI-generated images become increasingly similar to real ones. To address this challenge, we propose a novel difference-in-difference method. Instead of directly using the reconstruction error (a first-order difference), we compute the difference in reconstruction error -- a second-order difference -- for variance reduction and improving detection accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong generalization performance, enabling reliable detection of AI-generated images in the era of generative AI.

  _Tongyan Hua, Haoran Gong, Yuan Liu, Di Wang, Ying-Cong Chen, Wufan Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce BuildAnyPoint, a novel generative framework for structured 3D building reconstruction from point clouds with diverse distributions, such as those captured by airborne LiDAR and Structure-from-Motion. To recover artist-created building abstraction in this highly underconstrained setting, we capitalize on the role of explicit 3D generative priors in autoregressive mesh generation. Specifically, we design a Loosely Cascaded Diffusion Transformer (Loca-DiT) that initially recovers the underlying distribution from noisy or sparse points, followed by autoregressively encapsulating them into compact meshes. We first formulate distribution recovery as a conditional generation task by training latent diffusion models conditioned on input point clouds, and then tailor a decoder-only transformer for conditional autoregressive mesh generation based on the recovered point clouds. Our method delivers substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements over prior building abstraction methods. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our approach is evidenced by the strong performance of its recovered point clouds on building point cloud completion benchmarks, which exhibit improved surface accuracy and distribution uniformity.

- **[From Statics to Dynamics: Physics-Aware Image Editing with Latent Transition Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21778)**  `arXiv:2602.21778`  `cs.CV`  
  _Liangbing Zhao, Le Zhuo, Sayak Paul, Hongsheng Li, Mohamed Elhoseiny_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable success in semantic alignment, yet state-of-the-art models frequently fail to render physically plausible results when editing involves complex causal dynamics, such as refraction or material deformation. We attribute this limitation to the dominant paradigm that treats editing as a discrete mapping between image pairs, which provides only boundary conditions and leaves transition dynamics underspecified. To address this, we reformulate physics-aware editing as predictive physical state transitions and introduce PhysicTran38K, a large-scale video-based dataset comprising 38K transition trajectories across five physical domains, constructed via a two-stage filtering and constraint-aware annotation pipeline. Building on this supervision, we propose PhysicEdit, an end-to-end framework equipped with a textual-visual dual-thinking mechanism. It combines a frozen Qwen2.5-VL for physically grounded reasoning with learnable transition queries that provide timestep-adaptive visual guidance to a diffusion backbone. Experiments show that PhysicEdit improves over Qwen-Image-Edit by 5.9% in physical realism and 10.1% in knowledge-grounded editing, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, while remaining competitive with leading proprietary models.

- **[CRAFT-LoRA: Content-Style Personalization via Rank-Constrained Adaptation and Training-Free Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18936)**  `arXiv:2602.18936`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yu Li, Yujun Cai, Chi Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personalized image generation requires effectively balancing content fidelity with stylistic consistency when synthesizing images based on text and reference examples. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers an efficient personalization approach, with potential for precise control through combining LoRA weights on different concepts. However, existing combination techniques face persistent challenges: entanglement between content and style representations, insufficient guidance for controlling elements' influence, and unstable weight fusion that often require additional training. We address these limitations through CRAFT-LoRA, with complementary components: (1) rank-constrained backbone fine-tuning that injects low-rank projection residuals to encourage learning decoupled content and style subspaces; (2) a prompt-guided approach featuring an expert encoder with specialized branches that enables semantic extension and precise control through selective adapter aggregation; and (3) a training-free, timestep-dependent classifier-free guidance scheme that enhances generation stability by strategically adjusting noise predictions across diffusion steps.

  Recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable advancement, yet faithfully following complex textual descriptions remains challenging due to insufficient interactions between textual and visual features. Prior approaches enhance such interactions via architectural design or handcrafted textual condition weighting, but lack flexibility and overlook the dynamic interactions across different blocks and denoising stages. To provide a more flexible and efficient solution to this problem, we propose Diff-Aid, a lightweight inference-time method that adaptively adjusts per-token text and image interactions across transformer blocks and denoising timesteps. Beyond improving generation quality, Diff-Aid yields interpretable modulation patterns that reveal how different blocks, timesteps, and textual tokens contribute to semantic alignment during denoising. As a plug-and-play module, Diff-Aid can be seamlessly integrated into downstream applications for further improvement, including style LoRAs, controllable generation, and zero-shot editing. Experiments on strong baselines (SD 3.5 and FLUX) demonstrate consistent improvements in prompt adherence, visual quality, and human preference across various metrics. Our code and models will be released.

  Pre-trained diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images but remain inherently limited by their native training resolution. Recent training-free approaches have attempted to overcome this constraint by introducing interventions during the denoising process; however, these methods incur substantial computational overhead, often requiring more than five minutes to produce a single 4K image. In this paper, we present PixelRush, the first tuning-free framework for practical high-resolution text-to-image generation. Our method builds upon the established patch-based inference paradigm but eliminates the need for multiple inversion and regeneration cycles. Instead, PixelRush enables efficient patch-based denoising within a low-step regime. To address artifacts introduced by patch blending in few-step generation, we propose a seamless blending strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate over-smoothing effects through a noise injection mechanism. PixelRush delivers exceptional efficiency, generating 4K images in approximately 20 seconds representing a 10$\times$ to 35$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining superior visual fidelity. Extensive experiments validate both the performance gains and the quality of outputs achieved by our approach.

  Semantic scene understanding is crucial for robotics and computer vision applications. In autonomous driving, 3D semantic segmentation plays an important role for enabling safe navigation. Despite significant advances in the field, the complexity of collecting and annotating 3D data is a bottleneck in this developments. To overcome that data annotation limitation, synthetic simulated data has been used to generate annotated data on demand. There is still, however, a domain gap between real and simulated data. More recently, diffusion models have been in the spotlight, enabling close-to-real data synthesis. Those generative models have been recently applied to the 3D data domain for generating scene-scale data with semantic annotations. Still, those methods either rely on image projection or decoupled models trained with different resolutions in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such intermediary representations impact the generated data quality due to errors added in those transformations. In this work, we propose a novel approach able to generate 3D semantic scene-scale data without relying on any projection or decoupled trained multi-resolution models, achieving more realistic semantic scene data generation compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Besides improving 3D semantic scene-scale data synthesis, we thoroughly evaluate the use of the synthetic scene samples as labeled data to train a semantic segmentation network. In our experiments, we show that using the synthetic annotated data generated by our method as training data together with the real semantic segmentation labels, leads to an improvement in the semantic segmentation model performance. Our results show the potential of generated scene-scale point clouds to generate more training data to extend existing datasets, reducing the data annotation effort.

- **[Why Diffusion Language Models Struggle with Truly Parallel (Non-Autoregressive) Decoding?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23225)**  `arXiv:2602.23225`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`

  Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are often advertised as enabling parallel token generation, yet practical fast DLMs frequently converge to left-to-right, autoregressive (AR)-like decoding dynamics. In contrast, genuinely non-AR generation is promising because it removes AR's sequential bottleneck, better exploiting parallel hardware to reduce synchronization/communication overhead and improve latency scaling with output length. We argue that a primary driver of AR-like decoding is a mismatch between DLM objectives and the highly sequential structure of widely used training data, including standard pretraining corpora and long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose NAP (Non-Autoregressive Parallel DLMs), a proof-of-concept, data-centric approach that better aligns supervision with non-AR parallel decoding. NAP curates examples as multiple independent reasoning trajectories and couples them with a parallel-forced decoding strategy that encourages multi-token parallel updates. Across math reasoning benchmarks, NAP yields stronger performance under parallel decoding than DLMs trained on standard long CoT data, with gains growing as parallelism increases. Our results suggest that revisiting data and supervision is a principled direction for mitigating AR-like behavior and moving toward genuinely non-autoregressive parallel generation in DLMs. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have shown promising performance across various reasoning tasks, establishing themselves as an alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). Unlike autoregressive LLMs that generate one token per step based on all previous tokens, dLLMs theoretically enable parallel generation of multiple tokens at each decoding step. However, recent dLLMs still favor one-token-per-step generation in practice, as directly decoding multiple masked tokens often leads to degraded generation quality and stability. This reveals a substantial gap between the theoretical parallelism and practical performance of dLLMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce an adaptive parallel decoding approach, namely DiCo, which features a three-phase divide-and-conquer paradigm to unleash the inherent parallelism of dLLMs. During the Divide phase, DiCo first explores the input masked sequence and identifies masked tokens as seed tokens, which are then expanded to construct a set of local clusters. During the Conquer phase, DiCo performs parallel decoding across different local clusters constructed in the Divide phase. The divide-and-conquer process repeatedly alternates between the Divide and Conquer phases until convergence. During the Finalize phase, DiCo decodes the remaining few masked tokens using an effective fine-grained compound decoding scheme to finalize the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiCo can achieve significant inference speedups while maintaining competitive generation quality.
