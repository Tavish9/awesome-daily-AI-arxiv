- **[Generalizable Humanoid Manipulation with 3D Diffusion Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10803)**  `arXiv:2410.10803`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  Humanoid robots capable of autonomous operation in diverse environments have long been a goal for roboticists. However, autonomous manipulation by humanoid robots has largely been restricted to one specific scene, primarily due to the difficulty of acquiring generalizable skills and the expensiveness of in-the-wild humanoid robot data. In this work, we build a real-world robotic system to address this challenging problem. Our system is mainly an integration of 1) a whole-upper-body robotic teleoperation system to acquire human-like robot data, 2) a 25-DoF humanoid robot platform with a height-adjustable cart and a 3D LiDAR sensor, and 3) an improved 3D Diffusion Policy learning algorithm for humanoid robots to learn from noisy human data. We run more than 2000 episodes of policy rollouts on the real robot for rigorous policy evaluation. Empowered by this system, we show that using only data collected in one single scene and with only onboard computing, a full-sized humanoid robot can autonomously perform skills in diverse real-world scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids, overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic 4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence, and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.

- **[Missing Fine Details in Images: Last Seen in High Frequencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05441)**  `arXiv:2509.05441`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Tejaswini Medi, Hsien-Yi Wang, Arianna Rampini, Margret Keuper_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been proposed to learn effective latent representations, generated images often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions, due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency information during optimization, leading to over-smoothed outputs and visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures while preserving global structure. Moreover, we integrate our frequency-preserving latent embeddings into a SOTA latent diffusion model, resulting in sharper and more realistic image generation. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware optimization for realistic image synthesis, with broader implications for applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

- **[Closed-Loop Unsupervised Representation Disentanglement with $Œ≤$-VAE Distillation and Diffusion Probabilistic Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02346)**  `arXiv:2402.02346`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Xin Jin, Bohan Li, BAAO Xie, Wenyao Zhang, Jinming Liu, Ziqiang Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Representation disentanglement may help AI fundamentally understand the real world and thus benefit both discrimination and generation tasks. It currently has at least three unresolved core issues: (i) heavy reliance on label annotation and synthetic data -- causing poor generalization on natural scenarios; (ii) heuristic/hand-craft disentangling constraints make it hard to adaptively achieve an optimal training trade-off; (iii) lacking reasonable evaluation metric, especially for the real label-free data. To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{C}losed-\textbf{L}oop unsupervised representation \textbf{Dis}entanglement approach dubbed \textbf{CL-Dis}. Specifically, we use diffusion-based autoencoder (Diff-AE) as a backbone while resorting to $\beta$-VAE as a co-pilot to extract semantically disentangled representations. The strong generation ability of diffusion model and the good disentanglement ability of VAE model are complementary. To strengthen disentangling, VAE-latent distillation and diffusion-wise feedback are interconnected in a closed-loop system for a further mutual promotion. Then, a self-supervised \textbf{Navigation} strategy is introduced to identify interpretable semantic directions in the disentangled latent space. Finally, a new metric based on content tracking is designed to evaluate the disentanglement effect. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of CL-Dis on applications like real image manipulation and visual analysis.

- **[Reconstruction Alignment Improves Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07295)**  `arXiv:2509.07295`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Ji Xie, Trevor Darrell, Luke Zettlemoyer, XuDong Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours, post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit 6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

- **[BranchGRPO: Stable and Efficient GRPO with Structured Branching in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06040)**  `arXiv:2509.06040`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Yuming Li, Yikai Wang, Yuying Zhu, Zhongyu Zhao, Ming Lu, Qi She, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment. However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

- **[Breast Cancer Detection in Thermographic Images via Diffusion-Based Augmentation and Nonlinear Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07277)**  `arXiv:2509.07277`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Sepehr Salem, M. Moein Esfahani, Jingyu Liu, Vince Calhoun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

- **[Conditional Video Generation for High-Efficiency Video Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15269)**  `arXiv:2507.15269`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Fangqiu Yi, Jingyu Xu, Jiawei Shao, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Perceptual studies demonstrate that conditional diffusion models excel at reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction. Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task, where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr√©chet Video Distance (FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.

  _Ao Li, Jinpeng Liu, Yixuan Zhu, Yansong Tang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

- **[Semantic Watermarking Reinvented: Enhancing Robustness and Generation Quality with Fourier Integrity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07647)**  `arXiv:2509.07647`  `cs.CV`  
  _Sung Ju Lee, Nam Ik Cho_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably, our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking.

- **[Universal Few-Shot Spatial Control for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07530)**  `arXiv:2509.07530`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kiet T. Nguyen, Chanhuyk Lee, Donggyun Kim, Dong Hoon Lee, Seunghoon Hong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks, achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably, when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is available atthis https URL.

- **[LINR Bridge: Vector Graphic Animation via Neural Implicits and Video Diffusion Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07484)**  `arXiv:2509.07484`  `cs.CV`  
  _Wenshuo Gao, Xicheng Lan, Luyao Zhang, Shuai Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images. Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints, which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

- **[ANYPORTAL: Zero-Shot Consistent Video Background Replacement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07472)**  `arXiv:2509.07472`  `cs.CV`  
  _Wenshuo Gao, Xicheng Lan, Shuai Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting. To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient solution for video content creation and editing.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter (LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components. Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images, enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely 69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used will be publicly available via our project page:this https URL.

- **[Coefficients-Preserving Sampling for Reinforcement Learning with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05952)**  `arXiv:2509.05952`  `cs.CV`  
  _Feng Wang, Zihao Yu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models, specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method, Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released atthis https URL

- **[PromptEnhancer: A Simple Approach to Enhance Text-to-Image Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompt Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04545)**  `arXiv:2509.04545`  `cs.CV`  
  _Linqing Wang, Ximing Xing, Yiji Cheng, Zhiyuan Zhao, Jiale Tao, Qixun Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships. This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models. Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new, high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this direction.

- **[C-DiffDet+: Fusing Global Scene Context with Generative Denoising for High-Fidelity Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00578)**  `arXiv:2509.00578`  `cs.CV`  
  _Abdellah Zakaria Sellam, Ilyes Benaissa, Salah Eddine Bekhouche, Abdenour Hadid, Vito Ren√≥, Cosimo Distante_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

  _Sophia Sirko-Galouchenko, Spyros Gidaris, Antonin Vobecky, Andrei Bursuc, Nicolas Thome_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce DIP, a novel unsupervised post-training method designed to enhance dense image representations in large-scale pretrained vision encoders for in-context scene understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex self-distillation architectures, our method trains the vision encoder using pseudo-tasks that explicitly simulate downstream in-context scenarios, inspired by meta-learning principles. To enable post-training on unlabeled data, we propose an automatic mechanism for generating in-context tasks that combines a pretrained diffusion model and the vision encoder itself. DIP is simple, unsupervised, and computationally efficient, requiring less than 9 hours on a single A100 GPU. By learning dense representations through pseudo in-context tasks, it achieves strong performance across a wide variety of downstream real-world in-context scene understanding tasks. It outperforms both the initial vision encoder and prior methods, offering a practical and effective solution for improving dense representations. Code available here:this https URL

  _Weijing Tao, Xiaofeng Yang, Miaomiao Cui, Guosheng Lin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce InteractPro, a comprehensive framework for dynamic motion-aware image composition. At its core is InteractPlan, an intelligent planner that leverages a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) for scenario analysis and object placement, determining the optimal composition strategy to achieve realistic motion effects. Based on each scenario, InteractPlan selects between our two specialized modules: InteractPhys and InteractMotion. InteractPhys employs an enhanced Material Point Method (MPM)-based simulation to produce physically faithful and controllable object-scene interactions, capturing diverse and abstract events that require true physical modeling. InteractMotion, in contrast, is a training-free method based on pretrained video diffusion. Traditional composition approaches suffer from two major limitations: requiring manual planning for object placement and generating static, motionless outputs. By unifying simulation-based and diffusion-based methods under planner guidance, InteractPro overcomes these challenges, ensuring richly motion-aware compositions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate InteractPro's effectiveness in producing controllable, and coherent compositions across varied scenarios.

  _Yuqian Chen, Fan Zhang, Meng Wang, Leo R. Zekelman, Suheyla Cetin-Karayumak, Tengfei Xue, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The relationship between brain connections and non-imaging phenotypes is increasingly studied using deep neural networks. However, the local and global properties of brain white matter networks are often overlooked in convolutional network design. We introduce TractGraphFormer, a hybrid Graph CNN-Transformer deep learning framework tailored for diffusion MRI tractography. This model leverages local anatomical characteristics and global feature dependencies of white matter structures. The Graph CNN module captures white matter geometry and grey matter connectivity to aggregate local features from anatomically similar white matter connections, while the Transformer module uses self-attention to enhance global information learning. Additionally, TractGraphFormer includes an attention module for interpreting predictive white matter connections. We apply TractGraphFormer to tasks of sex and age prediction. TractGraphFormer shows strong performance in large datasets of children (n=9345) and young adults (n=1065). Overall, our approach suggests that widespread connections in the WM are predictive of the sex and age of an individual. For each prediction task, consistent predictive anatomical tracts are identified across the two datasets. The proposed approach highlights the potential of integrating local anatomical information and global feature dependencies to improve prediction performance in machine learning with diffusion MRI tractography.

- **[Directly Aligning the Full Diffusion Trajectory with Fine-Grained Human Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06942)**  `arXiv:2509.06942`  `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Xiangwei Shen, Zhimin Li, Zhantao Yang, Shiyi Zhang, Yingfang Zhang, Donghao Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of directly aligning diffusion models with human preferences using differentiable reward. However, they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive, thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX model with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.

- **[From Eigenmodes to Proofs: Integrating Graph Spectral Operators with Symbolic Interpretable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07017)**  `arXiv:2509.07017`  `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Andrew Kiruluta, Priscilla Burity_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment, adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations, and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures, while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.
