- **[DUViN: Diffusion-Based Underwater Visual Navigation via Knowledge-Transferred Depth Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02983)**  `arXiv:2509.02983`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous underwater navigation remains a challenging problem due to limited sensing capabilities and the difficulty of constructing accurate maps in underwater environments. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion-based Underwater Visual Navigation policy via knowledge-transferred depth features, named DUViN, which enables vision-based end-to-end 4-DoF motion control for underwater vehicles in unknown environments. DUViN guides the vehicle to avoid obstacles and maintain a safe and perception awareness altitude relative to the terrain without relying on pre-built maps. To address the difficulty of collecting large-scale underwater navigation datasets, we propose a method that ensures robust generalization under domain shifts from in-air to underwater environments by leveraging depth features and introducing a novel model transfer strategy. Specifically, our training framework consists of two phases: we first train the diffusion-based visual navigation policy on in-air datasets using a pre-trained depth feature extractor. Secondly, we retrain the extractor on an underwater depth estimation task and integrate the adapted extractor into the trained navigation policy from the first step. Experiments in both simulated and real-world underwater environments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. The experimental videos are available atthis https URL.

- **[Sem-RaDiff: Diffusion-Based 3D Radar Semantic Perception in Cluttered Agricultural Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02283)**  `arXiv:2509.02283`  `cs.RO`  
  _Ruibin Zhang, Fei Gao_

  Accurate and robust environmental perception is crucial for robot autonomous navigation. While current methods typically adopt optical sensors (e.g., camera, LiDAR) as primary sensing modalities, their susceptibility to visual occlusion often leads to degraded performance or complete system failure. In this paper, we focus on agricultural scenarios where robots are exposed to the risk of onboard sensor contamination. Leveraging radar's strong penetration capability, we introduce a radar-based 3D environmental perception framework as a viable alternative. It comprises three core modules designed for dense and accurate semantic perception: 1) Parallel frame accumulation to enhance signal-to-noise ratio of radar raw data. 2) A diffusion model-based hierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts then generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds. 3) A specifically designed sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data. We conducted extensive benchmark comparisons and experimental evaluations on a self-built dataset collected in real-world agricultural field scenes. Results demonstrate that our method achieves superior structural and semantic prediction performance compared to existing methods, while simultaneously reducing computational and memory costs by 51.3% and 27.5%, respectively. Furthermore, our approach achieves complete reconstruction and accurate classification of thin structures such as poles and wires-which existing methods struggle to perceive-highlighting its potential for dense and accurate 3D radar perception.

- **[On the MIA Vulnerability Gap Between Private GANs and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03341)**  `arXiv:2509.03341`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Ilana Sebag, Jean-Yves Franceschi, Alain Rakotomamonjy, Alexandre Allauzen, Jamal Atif_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models have emerged as leading approaches for high-quality image synthesis. While both can be trained under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality, remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.

- **[Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model for Brain Progression Modelling with Bidirectional Temporal Regularisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03141)**  `arXiv:2509.03141`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However, current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures, thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline (backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications, this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The code will be available upon acceptance.

- **[Enhancing Diffusion Model Stability for Image Restoration via Gradient Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06656)**  `arXiv:2507.06656`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Hongjie Wu, Mingqin Zhang, Linchao He, Ji-Zhe Zhou, Jiancheng Lv_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by leveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum (ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) have recently emerged as powerful generative models with great potential for solving inverse problems in imaging. However, leveraging such models in a Plug & Play (PnP), zero-shot manner remains challenging because it requires identifying a suitable text prompt for the unknown image of interest. Also, existing text-to-image PnP approaches are highly computationally expensive. We herein address these challenges by proposing a novel PnP inference paradigm specifically designed for embedding generative models within stochastic inverse solvers, with special attention to Latent Consistency Models (LCMs), which distill LDMs into fast generators. We leverage our framework to propose LAtent consisTency INverse sOlver (LATINO), the first zero-shot PnP framework to solve inverse problems with priors encoded by LCMs. Our conditioning mechanism avoids automatic differentiation and reaches SOTA quality in as little as 8 neural function evaluations. As a result, LATINO delivers remarkably accurate solutions and is significantly more memory and computationally efficient than previous approaches. We then embed LATINO within an empirical Bayesian framework that automatically calibrates the text prompt from the observed measurements by marginal maximum likelihood estimation. Extensive experiments show that prompt self-calibration greatly improves estimation, allowing LATINO with PRompt Optimization to define new SOTAs in image reconstruction quality and computational efficiency.

- **[Scaffold Diffusion: Sparse Multi-Category Voxel Structure Generation with Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00062)**  `arXiv:2509.00062`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Justin Jung_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that, unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over 98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize generated samples and the generation process:this https URL

- **[LD-RPS: Zero-Shot Unified Image Restoration via Latent Diffusion Recurrent Posterior Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00790)**  `arXiv:2507.00790`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unified image restoration is a significantly challenging task in low-level vision. Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks, limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints. To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition. Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness. Our code and data are available atthis https URL.

- **[OneCAT: Decoder-Only Auto-Regressive Model for Unified Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03498)**  `arXiv:2509.03498`  `cs.CV`  
  _Han Li, Xinyu Peng, Yaoming Wang, Zelin Peng, Xin Chen, Rongxiang Weng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.

- **[InfraDiffusion: zero-shot depth map restoration with diffusion models and prompted segmentation from sparse infrastructure point clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03324)**  `arXiv:2509.03324`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yixiong Jing, Cheng Zhang, Haibing Wu, Guangming Wang, Olaf Wysocki, Brian Sheil_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images. However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting, are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry assets.

- **[SynBT: High-quality Tumor Synthesis for Breast Tumor Segmentation by 3D Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03267)**  `arXiv:2509.03267`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hongxu Yang, Edina Timko, Levente Lippenszky, Vanda Czipczer, Lehel Ferenczi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI images.

- **[Towards Realistic Hand-Object Interaction with Gravity-Field Based Diffusion Bridge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03114)**  `arXiv:2509.03114`  `cs.CV`  
  _Miao Xu, Xiangyu Zhu, Xusheng Liang, Zidu Wang, Jinlin Wu, Zhen Lei_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

- **[DCDB: Dynamic Conditional Dual Diffusion Bridge for Ill-posed Multi-Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03044)**  `arXiv:2509.03044`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chengjie Huang, Jiafeng Yan, Jing Li, Lu Bai_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network, demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets.

- **[Enhancing Robustness in Post-Processing Watermarking: An Ensemble Attack Network Using CNNs and Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03006)**  `arXiv:2509.03006`  `cs.CV`  
  _Tzuhsuan Huang, Cheng Yu Yeo, Tsai-Ling Huang, Hong-Han Shuai, Wen-Huang Cheng, Jun-Cheng Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models. Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released at:this https URL.

- **[InstaDA: Augmenting Instance Segmentation Data with Dual-Agent System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02973)**  `arXiv:2509.02973`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xianbao Hou, Yonghao He, Zeyd Boukhers, John See, Hu Su, Wei Sui, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel, training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves. Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows, enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of +4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent categories.

- **[Discrete Noise Inversion for Next-scale Autoregressive Text-based Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01984)**  `arXiv:2509.01984`  `cs.CV`  
  _Quan Dao, Xiaoxiao He, Ligong Han, Ngan Hoai Nguyen, Amin Heyrani Nobar, Faez Ahmed, et al._

  Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing approach.

- **[C-DiffDet+: Fusing Global Scene Context with Generative Denoising for High-Fidelity Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00578)**  `arXiv:2509.00578`  `cs.CV`  
  _Abdellah Zakaria Sellam, Ilyes Benaissa, Salah Eddine Bekhouche, Abdenour Hadid, Vito Ren√≥, Cosimo Distante_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

- **[Insertion Language Models: Sequence Generation with Arbitrary-Position Insertions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05755)**  `arXiv:2505.05755`  `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Dhruvesh Patel, Aishwarya Sahoo, Avinash Amballa, Tahira Naseem, Tim G. J. Rudner, Andrew McCallum_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive models (ARMs), which predict subsequent tokens one-by-one ``from left to right,'' have achieved significant success across a wide range of sequence generation tasks. However, they struggle to accurately represent sequences that require satisfying sophisticated constraints or whose sequential dependencies are better addressed by out-of-order generation. Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) address some of these limitations, but the process of unmasking multiple tokens simultaneously in MDMs can introduce incoherences, and MDMs cannot handle arbitrary infilling constraints when the number of tokens to be filled in is not known in advance. In this work, we introduce Insertion Language Models (ILMs), which learn to insert tokens at arbitrary positions in a sequence -- that is, they select jointly both the position and the vocabulary element to be inserted. By inserting tokens one at a time, ILMs can represent strong dependencies between tokens, and their ability to generate sequences in arbitrary order allows them to accurately model sequences where token dependencies do not follow a left-to-right sequential structure. To train ILMs, we propose a tailored network parameterization and use a simple denoising objective. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that ILMs outperform both ARMs and MDMs on common planning tasks. Furthermore, we show that ILMs outperform MDMs and perform on par with ARMs in an unconditional text generation task while offering greater flexibility than MDMs in arbitrary-length text infilling.

  _Jusheng Zhang, Yijia Fan, Kaitong Cai, Zimeng Huang, Xiaofei Sun, Jian Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces DrDiff, a novel framework for long-text generation that overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off through three core technologies. First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA) mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.

  _Christopher Subia-Waud_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current AutoML platforms leave substantial performance untapped. Testing 180 fine-tuning tasks across models from 70M to 70B parameters, we found that HuggingFace AutoTrain, TogetherAI, Databricks, and Google Cloud consistently produce suboptimal configurations. Gradients, built on the Bittensor network, attacks this problem through competition. Independent miners race to find optimal hyperparameters, earning rewards proportional to their models' performance. This tournament drives exploration of configuration spaces that single-strategy methods never examine. In our experiments, Gradients achieved a 100\% win rate against TogetherAI, Databricks, and Google Cloud, and beat HuggingFace AutoTrain in 82.8\% of experiments. Mean improvements reached 42.1\% against commercial platforms. Retrieval-augmented generation tasks saw 30-40\% gains; diffusion models improved 23.4\% on person-specific generation. When miners compete for rewards, they develop optimization strategies that centralized approaches overlook. These findings demonstrate that decentralized systems with economic incentives can systematically outperform traditional AutoML, suggesting market dynamics may be key to achieving superior fine-tuning results.
