- **[Mini Diffuser: Fast Multi-task Diffusion Policy Training Using Two-level Mini-batches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09430)**  `arXiv:2505.09430`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  We present a method that reduces, by an order of magnitude, the time and memory needed to train multi-task vision-language robotic diffusion policies. This improvement arises from a previously underexplored distinction between action diffusion and the image diffusion techniques that inspired it: In image generation, the target is high-dimensional. By contrast, in action generation, the dimensionality of the target is comparatively small, and only the image condition is high-dimensional. Our approach, \emph{Mini Diffuser}, exploits this asymmetry by introducing \emph{two-level minibatching}, which pairs multiple noised action samples with each vision-language condition, instead of the conventional one-to-one sampling strategy. To support this batching scheme, we introduce architectural adaptations to the diffusion transformer that prevent information leakage across samples while maintaining full conditioning access. In RLBench simulations, Mini-Diffuser achieves 95\% of the performance of state-of-the-art multi-task diffusion policies, while using only 5\% of the training time and 7\% of the memory. Real-world experiments further validate that Mini-Diffuser preserves the key strengths of diffusion-based policies, including the ability to model multimodal action distributions and produce behavior conditioned on diverse perceptual inputs.

  Imitation learning has shown great promise in robotic manipulation, but the policy's execution is often unsatisfactorily slow due to commonly tardy demonstrations collected by human operators. In this work, we present DemoSpeedup, a self-supervised method to accelerate visuomotor policy execution via entropy-guided demonstration acceleration. DemoSpeedup starts from training an arbitrary generative policy (e.g., ACT or Diffusion Policy) on normal-speed demonstrations, which serves as a per-frame action entropy estimator. The key insight is that frames with lower action entropy estimates call for more consistent policy behaviors, which often indicate the demands for higher-precision operations. In contrast, frames with higher entropy estimates correspond to more casual sections, and therefore can be more safely accelerated. Thus, we segment the original demonstrations according to the estimated entropy, and accelerate them by down-sampling at rates that increase with the entropy values. Trained with the speedup demonstrations, the resulting policies execute up to 3 times faster while maintaining the task completion performance. Interestingly, these policies could even achieve higher success rates than those trained with normal-speed demonstrations, due to the benefits of reduced decision-making horizons.

- **[Offline Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning via Score Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05968)**  `arXiv:2505.05968`  `cs.LG` `cs.MA`

  Offline cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces unique challenges due to distributional shifts, particularly stemming from the high dimensionality of joint action spaces and the presence of out-of-distribution joint action selections. In this work, we highlight that a fundamental challenge in offline MARL arises from the multi-equilibrium nature of cooperative tasks, which induces a highly multimodal joint behavior policy space coupled with heterogeneous-quality behavior data. This makes it difficult for individual policy regularization to align with a consistent coordination pattern, leading to the policy distribution shift problems. To tackle this challenge, we design a sequential score function decomposition method that distills per-agent regularization signals from the joint behavior policy, which induces coordinated modality selection under decentralized execution constraints. Then we leverage a flexible diffusion-based generative model to learn these score functions from multimodal offline data, and integrate them into joint-action critics to guide policy updates toward high-reward, in-distribution regions under a shared team reward. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple particle environments and Multi-agent MuJoCo benchmarks consistently. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly address the distributional gap between offline and online MARL, paving the way for more generalizable offline policy-based MARL methods.

- **[Exploring bidirectional bounds for minimax-training of Energy-based models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04609)**  `arXiv:2506.04609`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases, we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally, we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

- **[Exploring Diffusion Transformer Designs via Grafting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05340)**  `arXiv:2506.05340`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators (e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width). However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants. Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model (PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77) than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging from operator replacement to architecture restructuring.

- **[Sparse Autoencoders, Again?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04859)**  `arXiv:2506.04859`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)? Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

- **[ADG: Ambient Diffusion-Guided Dataset Recovery for Corruption-Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23871)**  `arXiv:2505.23871`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-world datasets collected from sensors or human inputs are prone to noise and errors, posing significant challenges for applying offline reinforcement learning (RL). While existing methods have made progress in addressing corrupted actions and rewards, they remain insufficient for handling corruption in high-dimensional state spaces and for cases where multiple elements in the dataset are corrupted simultaneously. Diffusion models, known for their strong denoising capabilities, offer a promising direction for this problem-but their tendency to overfit noisy samples limits their direct applicability. To overcome this, we propose Ambient Diffusion-Guided Dataset Recovery (ADG), a novel approach that pioneers the use of diffusion models to tackle data corruption in offline RL. First, we introduce Ambient Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) from approximated distributions, which enable learning on partially corrupted datasets with theoretical guarantees. Second, we use the noise-prediction property of Ambient DDPM to distinguish between clean and corrupted data, and then use the clean subset to train a standard DDPM. Third, we employ the trained standard DDPM to refine the previously identified corrupted data, enhancing data quality for subsequent offline RL training. A notable strength of ADG is its versatility-it can be seamlessly integrated with any offline RL algorithm. Experiments on a range of benchmarks, including MuJoCo, Kitchen, and Adroit, demonstrate that ADG effectively mitigates the impact of corrupted data and improves the robustness of offline RL under various noise settings, achieving state-of-the-art results.

- **[Learning normalized image densities via dual score matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05310)**  `arXiv:2506.05310`  `cs.LG`  
  _Florentin Guth, Zahra Kadkhodaie, Eero P Simoncelli_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized} energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective, ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64 dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a low-dimensional manifold.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e. learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2) a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions required to combine these and other components for stable and sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data. Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by 5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[How to Unlock Time Series Editing? Diffusion-Driven Approach with Multi-Grained Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05276)**  `arXiv:2506.05276`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing (TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence - consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs, offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.

- **[Locality Preserving Markovian Transition for Instance Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05196)**  `arXiv:2506.05196`  `cs.LG`  
  _Jifei Luo, Wenzheng Wu, Hantao Yao, Lu Yu, Changsheng Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate manifold distance measurement. The proposed LPMT first integrates diffusion processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion (BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local consistency. These distributions are interconnected via the Thermodynamic Markovian Transition (TMT) process, enabling efficient global retrieval while maintaining local effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse tasks confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

- **[Neural MJD: Neural Non-Stationary Merton Jump Diffusion for Time Series Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04542)**  `arXiv:2506.04542`  `cs.LG`  
  _Yuanpei Gao, Qi Yan, Yan Leng, Renjie Liao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data, especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model. Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It√¥ diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical learning methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including diffusion models for image generation and transformer-based language models. While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data used to pre-train the backbone models. We propose Backbone Augmented Training (BAT), a method that leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset. First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

  _Stefano Zampini, Jacob Christopher, Luca Oneto, Davide Anguita, Ferdinando Fioretto_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Stable diffusion models represent the state-of-the-art in data synthesis across diverse domains and hold transformative potential for applications in science and engineering, e.g., by facilitating the discovery of novel solutions and simulating systems that are computationally intractable to model explicitly. While there is increasing effort to incorporate physics-based constraints into generative models, existing techniques are either limited in their applicability to latent diffusion frameworks or lack the capability to strictly enforce domain-specific constraints. To address this limitation this paper proposes a novel integration of stable diffusion models with constrained optimization frameworks, enabling the generation of outputs satisfying stringent physical and functional requirements. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through material design experiments requiring adherence to precise morphometric properties, challenging inverse design tasks involving the generation of materials inducing specific stress-strain responses, and copyright-constrained content generation tasks.

  _Marvin Li, Aayush Karan, Sitan Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models can exhibit unexpected behavior in the blink of an eye. In a recent computer use demo, a language model switched from coding to Googling pictures of Yellowstone, and these sudden shifts in behavior have also been observed in reasoning patterns and jailbreaks. This phenomenon is not unique to autoregressive models: in diffusion models, key features of the final output are decided in narrow ``critical windows'' of the generation process. In this work we develop a simple, unifying theory to explain this phenomenon using the formalism of stochastic localization samplers. We show that it emerges generically as the generation process localizes to a sub-population of the distribution it models.While critical windows have been studied at length in diffusion models, existing theory heavily relies on strong distributional assumptions and the particulars of Gaussian diffusion. In contrast to existing work our theory (1) applies to autoregressive and diffusion models; (2) makes no distributional assumptions; (3) quantitatively improves previous bounds even when specialized to diffusions; and (4) requires basic tools and no stochastic calculus or statistical-physics-based machinery. We also identify an intriguing connection to the all-or-nothing phenomenon from statistical inference. Finally, we validate our predictions empirically for LLMs and find that critical windows often coincide with failures in problem solving for various math and reasoning benchmarks.

  Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer (VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field. To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus meeting the needs of the medical field.

- **[Quantifying Cross-Modality Memorization in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05198)**  `arXiv:2506.05198`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Yuxin Wen, Yangsibo Huang, Tom Goldstein, Ravi Kumar, Badih Ghazi, Chiyuan Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore, we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning is providing a wealth of new approaches to the problem of novel view synthesis, from Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) based approaches to end-to-end style architectures. Each approach offers specific strengths but also comes with limitations in their applicability. This work introduces ViewFusion, an end-to-end generative approach to novel view synthesis with unparalleled flexibility. ViewFusion consists in simultaneously applying a diffusion denoising step to any number of input views of a scene, then combining the noise gradients obtained for each view with an (inferred) pixel-weighting mask, ensuring that for each region of the target view only the most informative input views are taken into account. Our approach resolves several limitations of previous approaches by (1) being trainable and generalizing across multiple scenes and object classes, (2) adaptively taking in a variable number of pose-free views at both train and test time, (3) generating plausible views even in severely underdetermined conditions (thanks to its generative nature) -- all while generating views of quality on par or even better than comparable methods. Limitations include not generating a 3D embedding of the scene, resulting in a relatively slow inference speed, and our method only being tested on the relatively small Neural 3D Mesh Renderer dataset.

  Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However, current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from 50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

  Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions. When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally, HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks in a zero-shot manner.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  One-step text-to-image generator models offer advantages such as swift inference efficiency, flexible architectures, and state-of-the-art generation performance. In this paper, we study the problem of aligning one-step generator models with human preferences for the first time. Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning using human feedback (RLHF), we formulate the alignment problem as maximizing expected human reward functions while adding an Integral Kullback-Leibler divergence term to prevent the generator from diverging. By overcoming technical challenges, we introduce Diff-Instruct++ (DI++), the first, fast-converging and image data-free human preference alignment method for one-step text-to-image generators. We also introduce novel theoretical insights, showing that using CFG for diffusion distillation is secretly doing RLHF with DI++. Such an interesting finding brings understanding and potential contributions to future research involving CFG. In the experiment sections, we align both UNet-based and DiT-based one-step generators using DI++, which use the Stable Diffusion 1.5 and the PixelArt-$\alpha$ as the reference diffusion processes. The resulting DiT-based one-step text-to-image model achieves a strong Aesthetic Score of 6.19 and an Image Reward of 1.24 on the COCO validation prompt dataset. It also achieves a leading Human preference Score (HPSv2.0) of 28.48, outperforming other open-sourced models such as Stable Diffusion XL, DMD2, SD-Turbo, as well as PixelArt-$\alpha$. Both theoretical contributions and empirical evidence indicate that DI++ is a strong human-preference alignment approach for one-step text-to-image models. The homepage of the paper isthis https URL.

  We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for individual identification, 2D pose estimation, and instance segmentation of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). CzechLynx includes more than 30k camera trap images annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians. To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments, poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just individual animal re-identification.

  Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models capable of producing high-fidelity images but are constrained by high computational costs due to iterative multi-step inference. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can optimize DMs, existing methods are hindered by retraining requirements, exponential search complexity from step-wise optimization, and slow evaluation relying on massive image generation. To address these challenges, we propose Flexiffusion, a training-free NAS framework that jointly optimizes generation schedules and model architectures without modifying pre-trained parameters. Our key insight is to decompose the generation process into flexible segments of equal length, where each segment dynamically combines three step types: full (complete computation), partial (cache-reused computation), and null (skipped computation). This segment-wise search space reduces the candidate pool exponentially compared to step-wise NAS while preserving architectural diversity. Further, we introduce relative FID (rFID), a lightweight evaluation metric for NAS that measures divergence from a teacher model's outputs instead of ground truth, slashing evaluation time by over $90\%$. In practice, Flexiffusion achieves at least $2\times$ acceleration across LDMs, Stable Diffusion, and DDPMs on ImageNet and MS-COCO, with FID degradation under $5\%$, outperforming prior NAS and caching methods. Notably, it attains $5.1\times$ speedup on Stable Diffusion with near-identical CLIP scores. Our work pioneers a resource-efficient paradigm for searching high-speed DMs without sacrificing quality.

  Unconditional flow-matching trains diffusion models to transport samples from a source distribution to a target distribution by enforcing that the flows between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g., class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows, enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs. We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x, (2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9 compared to training the same models with flow matching.

  Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration, extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored, particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2, which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically, an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses, including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a single step.

  Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on previous ones. However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore, by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35, surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling speed.

  Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the 3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complexthis http URL, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of Follow-Your-Motion.

  Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.

  Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting their applicability.We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs) while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods (<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).

This allows us to scale editing data effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for computing a diffusion loss and a reward loss. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0 on our testing benchmarks, for real image editing, where it achieves a best trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%, compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

  Text-driven video editing aims to modify video content according to natural language instructions. While recent training-free approaches have made progress by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on inversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which often leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To address this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing framework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in data space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to smoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby preserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and controllable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that modulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially and temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic alignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential signals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward stronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency, and background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and coherent video editing without inversion.

  Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data. We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at:this https URL

  Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a well-established technique for removing epithelial lesions. Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements, learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios. To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization. Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips, experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.

  We propose a novel two-stage framework for sensor depth enhancement, called Perfecting Depth. This framework leverages the stochastic nature of diffusion models to automatically detect unreliable depth regions while preserving geometric cues. In the first stage (stochastic estimation), the method identifies unreliable measurements and infers geometric structure by leveraging a training-inference domain gap. In the second stage (deterministic refinement), it enforces structural consistency and pixel-level accuracy using the uncertainty map derived from the first stage. By combining stochastic uncertainty modeling with deterministic refinement, our method yields dense, artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse real-world scenarios. Furthermore, theoretical analysis, various experiments, and qualitative visualizations validate its robustness and scalability. Our framework sets a new baseline for sensor depth enhancement, with potential applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and immersive technologies.

  SmartAvatar is a vision-language-agent-driven framework for generating fully rigged, animation-ready 3D human avatars from a single photo or textual prompt. While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity, body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance, making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications. Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.

  The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks) and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios, diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against diffusion-based editing.

  3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail, accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality. We will make the code and dataset available.

  Fine-grained and efficient controllability on video diffusion transformers has raised increasing desires for the applicability. Recently, In-context Conditioning emerged as a powerful paradigm for unified conditional video generation, which enables diverse controls by concatenating varying context conditioning signals with noisy video latents into a long unified token sequence and jointly processing them via full-attention, e.g., FullDiT. Despite their effectiveness, these methods face quadratic computation overhead as task complexity increases, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we study the efficiency bottleneck neglected in original in-context conditioning video generation framework. We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key sources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within context condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent interactions throughout the diffusion process. Based on these insights, we propose FullDiT2, an efficient in-context conditioning framework for general controllability in both video generation and editing tasks, which innovates from two key perspectives. Firstly, to address the token redundancy, FullDiT2 leverages a dynamic token selection mechanism to adaptively identify important context tokens, reducing the sequence length for unified full-attention. Additionally, a selective context caching mechanism is devised to minimize redundant interactions between condition tokens and video latents. Extensive experiments on six diverse conditional video editing and generation tasks demonstrate that FullDiT2 achieves significant computation reduction and 2-3 times speedup in averaged time cost per diffusion step, with minimal degradation or even higher performance in video generation quality.

  Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation has significant application potential. However, current 3D HOI motion generation approaches heavily rely on predefined 3D object models and lab-captured motion data, limiting generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, HOI video generation methods prioritize pixel-level visual fidelity, often sacrificing physical plausibility. Recognizing that visual appearance and motion patterns share fundamental physical laws in the real world, we propose a novel framework that combines visual priors and dynamic constraints within a synchronized diffusion process to generate the HOI video and motion simultaneously. To integrate the heterogeneous semantics, appearance, and motion features, our method implements tri-modal adaptive modulation for feature aligning, coupled with 3D full-attention for modeling inter- and intra-modal dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce a vision-aware 3D interaction diffusion model that generates explicit 3D interaction sequences directly from the synchronized diffusion outputs, then feeds them back to establish a closed-loop feedback cycle. This architecture eliminates dependencies on predefined object models or explicit pose guidance while significantly enhancing video-motion consistency. Experimental results demonstrate our method's superiority over state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity, dynamically plausible HOI sequences, with notable generalization capabilities in unseen real-world scenarios.

  In Omnimatte, one aims to decompose a given video into semantically meaningful layers, including the background and individual objects along with their associated effects, such as shadows and reflections. Existing methods often require extensive training or costly self-supervised optimization. In this paper, we present OmnimatteZero, a training-free approach that leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained video diffusion models for omnimatte. It can remove objects from videos, extract individual object layers along with their effects, and composite those objects onto new videos. These are accomplished by adapting zero-shot image inpainting techniques for video object removal, a task they fail to handle effectively out-of-the-box. To overcome this, we introduce temporal and spatial attention guidance modules that steer the diffusion process for accurate object removal and temporally consistent background reconstruction. We further show that self-attention maps capture information about the object and its footprints and use them to inpaint the object's effects, leaving a clean background. Additionally, through simple latent arithmetic, object layers can be isolated and recombined seamlessly with new video layers to produce new videos. Evaluations show that OmnimatteZero not only achieves superior performance in terms of background reconstruction but also sets a new record for the fastest Omnimatte approach, achieving real-time performance with minimal frame runtime.

  Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with 3D full attention power state-of-the-art video generation, but suffer from prohibitive compute cost -- when generating just a 5-second 720P video, attention alone takes 800 out of 945 seconds of total inference time. This paper introduces sliding tile attention (STA) to address this challenge. STA leverages the observation that attention scores in pretrained video diffusion models predominantly concentrate within localized 3D windows. By sliding and attending over the local spatial-temporal region, STA eliminates redundancy from full attention. Unlike traditional token-wise sliding window attention (SWA), STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel hardware-aware sliding window design, preserving expressiveness while being hardware-efficient. With careful kernel-level optimizations, STA offers the first efficient 2D/3D sliding-window-like attention implementation, achieving 58.79% MFU. Precisely, STA accelerates attention by 2.8-17x over FlashAttention-2 (FA2) and 1.6-10x over FlashAttention-3 (FA3). On the leading video DiT, HunyuanVideo, STA reduces end-to-end latency from 945s (FA3) to 685s without quality degradation, requiring no training. Enabling finetuning further lowers latency to 268s with only a 0.09% drop on VBench. We make our codebase public atthis https URL.

  In this work, we explore a cost-effective framework for multilingual image generation. We find that, unlike models tuned on high-quality images with multilingual annotations, leveraging text encoders pre-trained on widely available, noisy Internet image-text pairs significantly enhances data efficiency in text-to-image (T2I) generation across multiplethis http URLon this insight, we introduce MuLan, Multi-Language adapter, a lightweight language adapter with fewer than 20M parameters, trained alongside a frozen text encoder and image diffusion model. Compared to previous multilingual T2I models, this framework offers: (1) Cost efficiency. Using readily accessible English data and off-the-shelf multilingual text encoders minimizes the training cost; (2) High performance. Achieving comparable generation capabilities in over 110 languages with CLIP similarity scores nearly matching those in English (39.57 for English vs. 39.61 for other languages); and (3) Broad applicability. Seamlessly integrating with compatible community tools like LoRA, LCM, ControlNet, and IP-Adapter, expanding its potential use cases.

  Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold. This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM failures.

  We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. ProLoRA transfers pre-trained low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without additional training data. This overcomes the limitations of traditional methods that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and comparable performance without retraining.
