- **[Tool-as-Interface: Learning Robot Policies from Observing Human Tool Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04612)**  `arXiv:2504.04612`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  Tool use is essential for enabling robots to perform complex real-world tasks, but learning such skills requires extensive datasets. While teleoperation is widely used, it is slow, delay-sensitive, and poorly suited for dynamic tasks. In contrast, human videos provide a natural way for data collection without specialized hardware, though they pose challenges on robot learning due to viewpoint variations and embodiment gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that transfers tool-use knowledge from humans to robots. To improve the policy's robustness to viewpoint variations, we use two RGB cameras to reconstruct 3D scenes and apply Gaussian splatting for novel view synthesis. We reduce the embodiment gap using segmented observations and tool-centric, task-space actions to achieve embodiment-invariant visuomotor policy learning. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness across a diverse suite of tool-use tasks, where our learned policy shows strong generalization and robustness to human perturbations, camera motion, and robot base movement. Our method achieves a 71\% improvement in task success over teleoperation-based diffusion policies and dramatically reduces data collection time by 77\% and 41\% compared to teleoperation and the state-of-the-art interface, respectively.

- **[Tenma: Robust Cross-Embodiment Robot Manipulation with Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11865)**  `arXiv:2509.11865`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scaling Transformer policies and diffusion models has advanced robotic manipulation, yet combining these techniques in lightweight, cross-embodiment learning settings remains challenging. We study design choices that most affect stability and performance for diffusion-transformer policies trained on heterogeneous, multimodal robot data, and introduce Tenma, a lightweight diffusion-transformer for bi-manual arm control. Tenma integrates multiview RGB, proprioception, and language via a cross-embodiment normalizer that maps disparate state/action spaces into a shared latent space; a Joint State-Time encoder for temporally aligned observation learning with inference speed boosts; and a diffusion action decoder optimized for training stability and learning capacity. Across benchmarks and under matched compute, Tenma achieves an average success rate of 88.95% in-distribution and maintains strong performance under object and scene shifts, substantially exceeding baseline policies whose best in-distribution average is 18.12%. Despite using moderate data scale, Tenma delivers robust manipulation and generalization, indicating the great potential for multimodal and cross-embodiment learning strategies for further augmenting the capacity of transformer-based imitation learning policies.

- **[Inference-stage Adaptation-projection Strategy Adapts Diffusion Policy to Cross-manipulators Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11621)**  `arXiv:2509.11621`  `cs.RO`  
  _Xiangtong Yao, Yirui Zhou, Yuan Meng, Yanwen Liu, Liangyu Dong, Zitao Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion policies are powerful visuomotor models for robotic manipulation, yet they often fail to generalize to manipulators or end-effectors unseen during training and struggle to accommodate new task requirements at inference time. Addressing this typically requires costly data recollection and policy retraining for each new hardware or task configuration. To overcome this, we introduce an adaptation-projection strategy that enables a diffusion policy to perform zero-shot adaptation to novel manipulators and dynamic task settings, entirely at inference time and without any retraining. Our method first trains a diffusion policy in SE(3) space using demonstrations from a base manipulator. During online deployment, it projects the policy's generated trajectories to satisfy the kinematic and task-specific constraints imposed by the new hardware and objectives. Moreover, this projection dynamically adapts to physical differences (e.g., tool-center-point offsets, jaw widths) and task requirements (e.g., obstacle heights), ensuring robust and successful execution. We validate our approach on real-world pick-and-place, pushing, and pouring tasks across multiple manipulators, including the Franka Panda and Kuka iiwa 14, equipped with a diverse array of end-effectors like flexible grippers, Robotiq 2F/3F grippers, and various 3D-printed designs. Our results demonstrate consistently high success rates in these cross-manipulator scenarios, proving the effectiveness and practicality of our adaptation-projection strategy. The code will be released after peer review.

- **[ActivePose: Active 6D Object Pose Estimation and Tracking for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11364)**  `arXiv:2509.11364`  `cs.RO`  
  _Sheng Liu, Zhe Li, Weiheng Wang, Han Sun, Heng Zhang, Hongpeng Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate 6-DoF object pose estimation and tracking are critical for reliable robotic manipulation. However, zero-shot methods often fail under viewpoint-induced ambiguities and fixed-camera setups struggle when objects move or become self-occluded. To address these challenges, we propose an active pose estimation pipeline that combines a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with "robotic imagination" to dynamically detect and resolve ambiguities in real time. In an offline stage, we render a dense set of views of the CAD model, compute the FoundationPose entropy for each view, and construct a geometric-aware prompt that includes low-entropy (unambiguous) and high-entropy (ambiguous) examples. At runtime, the system: (1) queries the VLM on the live image for an ambiguity score; (2) if ambiguity is detected, imagines a discrete set of candidate camera poses by rendering virtual views, scores each based on a weighted combination of VLM ambiguity probability and FoundationPose entropy, and then moves the camera to the Next-Best-View (NBV) to obtain a disambiguated pose estimation. Furthermore, since moving objects may leave the camera's field of view, we introduce an active pose tracking module: a diffusion-policy trained via imitation learning, which generates camera trajectories that preserve object visibility and minimize pose ambiguity. Experiments in simulation and real-world show that our approach significantly outperforms classical baselines.

- **[DRAG: Data Reconstruction Attack using Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11724)**  `arXiv:2509.11724`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Wa-Kin Lei, Jun-Cheng Chen, Shang-Tse Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rise of large foundation models, split inference (SI) has emerged as a popular computational paradigm for deploying models across lightweight edge devices and cloud servers, addressing data privacy and computational cost concerns. However, most existing data reconstruction attacks have focused on smaller CNN classification models, leaving the privacy risks of foundation models in SI settings largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel data reconstruction attack based on guided diffusion, which leverages the rich prior knowledge embedded in a latent diffusion model (LDM) pre-trained on a large-scale dataset. Our method performs iterative reconstruction on the LDM's learned image prior, effectively generating high-fidelity images resembling the original data from their intermediate representations (IR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in reconstructing data from deep-layer IRs of the vision foundation model. The results highlight the urgent need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms for large models in SI scenarios. Code is available at:this https URL.

- **[Data-Efficient Ensemble Weather Forecasting with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11047)**  `arXiv:2509.11047`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Kevin Valencia, Ziyang Liu, Justin Cui_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although numerical weather forecasting methods have dominated the field, recent advances in deep learning methods, such as diffusion models, have shown promise in ensemble weather forecasting. However, such models are typically autoregressive and are thus computationally expensive. This is a challenge in climate science, where data can be limited, costly, or difficult to work with. In this work, we explore the impact of curated data selection on these autoregressive diffusion models. We evaluate several data sampling strategies and show that a simple time stratified sampling approach achieves performance similar to or better than full-data training. Notably, it outperforms the full-data model on certain metrics and performs only slightly worse on others while using only 20% of the training data. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of data-efficient diffusion training, especially for weather forecasting, and motivates future work on adaptive or model-aware sampling methods that go beyond random or purely temporal sampling.

- **[Robustifying Diffusion-Denoised Smoothing Against Covariate Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10913)**  `arXiv:2509.10913`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Randomized smoothing is a well-established method for achieving certified robustness against l2-adversarial perturbations. By incorporating a denoiser before the base classifier, pretrained classifiers can be seamlessly integrated into randomized smoothing without significant performance degradation. Among existing methods, Diffusion Denoised Smoothing - where a pretrained denoising diffusion model serves as the denoiser - has produced state-of-the-art results. However, we show that employing a denoising diffusion model introduces a covariate shift via misestimation of the added noise, ultimately degrading the smoothed classifier's performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel adversarial objective function focused on the added noise of the denoising diffusion model. This approach is inspired by our understanding of the origin of the covariate shift. Our goal is to train the base classifier to ensure it is robust against the covariate shift introduced by the denoiser. Our method significantly improves certified accuracy across three standard classification benchmarks - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet - achieving new state-of-the-art performance in l2-adversarial perturbations. Our implementation is publicly available atthis https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image generation with their ability to synthesize realistic and diverse scenes, they continue to struggle to generate consistent and legible text within images. This shortcoming is commonly attributed to the locality bias inherent in diffusion-based generation, which limits their ability to model long-range spatial dependencies. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{STRICT}$, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test the ability of diffusion models to render coherent and instruction-aligned text in images. Our benchmark evaluates models across multiple dimensions: (1) the maximum length of readable text that can be generated; (2) the correctness and legibility of the generated text, and (3) the ratio of not following instructions for generating text. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models, including proprietary and open-source variants, and reveal persistent limitations in long-range consistency and instruction-following capabilities. Our findings provide insights into architectural bottlenecks and motivate future research directions in multimodal generative modeling. We release our entire evaluation pipeline atthis https URL.

- **[SpeCa: Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Speculative Feature Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11628)**  `arXiv:2509.11628`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications. These models face two fundamental challenges: strict temporal dependencies preventing parallelization, and computationally intensive forward passes required at each denoising step. Drawing inspiration from speculative decoding in large language models, we present SpeCa, a novel 'Forecast-then-verify' acceleration framework that effectively addresses both limitations. SpeCa's core innovation lies in introducing Speculative Sampling to diffusion models, predicting intermediate features for subsequent timesteps based on fully computed reference timesteps. Our approach implements a parameter-free verification mechanism that efficiently evaluates prediction reliability, enabling real-time decisions to accept or reject each prediction while incurring negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, SpeCa introduces sample-adaptive computation allocation that dynamically modulates resources based on generation complexity, allocating reduced computation for simpler samples while preserving intensive processing for complex instances. Experiments demonstrate 6.34x acceleration on FLUX with minimal quality degradation (5.5% drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT while preserving generation fidelity, and 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo. The verification mechanism incurs minimal overhead (1.67%-3.5% of full inference costs), establishing a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference while maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios.

- **[Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting and Mode Collapse in Text-to-Image Diffusion via Latent Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10529)**  `arXiv:2509.10529`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning -- the ability to acquire knowledge incrementally without forgetting previous skills -- is fundamental to natural intelligence. While the human brain excels at this, artificial neural networks struggle with "catastrophic forgetting," where learning new tasks erases previously acquired knowledge. This challenge is particularly severe for text-to-image diffusion models, which generate images from textual prompts. Additionally, these models face "mode collapse," where their outputs become increasingly repetitive over time. To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a neuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods mitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically requiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only compact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal architecture. This mirrors the hippocampal process of storing neural activity patterns rather than raw sensory inputs, reducing memory usage while preserving critical information. Through experiments with five sequentially learned visual concepts, we demonstrate that Latent Replay significantly outperforms existing methods in maintaining model versatility. After learning all concepts, our approach retained 77.59% Image Alignment (IA) on the earliest concept, 14% higher than baseline methods, while maintaining diverse outputs. Surprisingly, random selection of stored latent examples outperforms similarity-based strategies. Our findings suggest that Latent Replay enables efficient continual learning for generative AI models, paving the way for personalized text-to-image models that evolve with user needs without excessive computational costs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the domain of text-to-image generative models, biases inherent in training datasets often propagate into generated content, posing significant ethical challenges, particularly in socially sensitive contexts. We introduce FairCoT, a novel framework that enhances fairness in text to image models through Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning within multimodal generative large language models. FairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement to systematically mitigate biases, and dynamically adjusts textual prompts in real time, ensuring diverse and equitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative reasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero shot CoT in sensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility. Experimental evaluations across popular text-to-image systems including DALLE and various Stable Diffusion variants, demonstrate that FairCoT significantly enhances fairness and diversity without sacrificing image quality or semantic fidelity. By combining robust reasoning, lightweight deployment, and extensibility to multiple models, FairCoT represents a promising step toward more socially responsible and transparent AI driven content generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight: Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints on the project page:this http URL

- **[ToMA: Token Merge with Attention for Image Generation with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10918)**  `arXiv:2509.10918`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Wenbo Lu, Shaoyi Zheng, Yuxuan Xia, Shengjie Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models excel in high-fidelity image generation but face scalability limits due to transformers' quadratic attention complexity. Plug-and-play token reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting, scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3) exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%, respectively (with DINO $\Delta < 0.07$), outperforming prior methods. This work bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for transformers in diffusion.

- **[From Noise to Precision: A Diffusion-Driven Approach to Zero-Inflated Precipitation Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10501)**  `arXiv:2509.10501`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Wentao Gao, Jiuyong Li, Lin Liu, Thuc Duy Le, Xiongren Chen, Xiaojing Du, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-inflated data pose significant challenges in precipitation forecasting due to the predominance of zeros with sparse non-zero events. To address this, we propose the Zero Inflation Diffusion Framework (ZIDF), which integrates Gaussian perturbation for smoothing zero-inflated distributions, Transformer-based prediction for capturing temporal patterns, and diffusion-based denoising to restore the original data structure. In our experiments, we use observational precipitation data collected from South Australia along with synthetically generated zero-inflated data. Results show that ZIDF demonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple state-of-the-art precipitation forecasting models, achieving up to 56.7\% reduction in MSE and 21.1\% reduction in MAE relative to the baseline Non-stationary Transformer. These findings highlight ZIDF's ability to robustly handle sparse time series data and suggest its potential generalizability to other domains where zero inflation is a key challenge.

- **[On the Escaping Efficiency of Distributed Adversarial Training Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11337)**  `arXiv:2509.11337`  `cs.LG`  
  _Ying Cao, Kun Yuan, Ali H. Sayed_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adversarial training has been widely studied in recent years due to its role in improving model robustness against adversarial attacks. This paper focuses on comparing different distributed adversarial training algorithms--including centralized and decentralized strategies--within multi-agent learning environments. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of model flatness in determining robustness. To this end, we develop a general theoretical framework to study the escaping efficiency of these algorithms from local minima, which is closely related to the flatness of the resulting models. We show that when the perturbation bound is sufficiently small (i.e., when the attack strength is relatively mild) and a large batch size is used, decentralized adversarial training algorithms--including consensus and diffusion--are guaranteed to escape faster from local minima than the centralized strategy, thereby favoring flatter minima. However, as the perturbation bound increases, this trend may no longer hold. In the simulation results, we illustrate our theoretical findings and systematically compare the performance of models obtained through decentralized and centralized adversarial training algorithms. The results highlight the potential of decentralized strategies to enhance the robustness of models in distributed settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While generative world models have advanced video and occupancy-based data synthesis, LiDAR generation remains underexplored despite its importance for accurate 3D perception. Extending generation to 4D LiDAR data introduces challenges in controllability, temporal stability, and evaluation. We present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework that converts free-form language into editable LiDAR sequences. Instructions are parsed into ego-centric scene graphs, which a tri-branch diffusion model transforms into object layouts, trajectories, and shapes. A range-image diffusion model generates the initial scan, and an autoregressive module extends it into a temporally coherent sequence. The explicit layout design further supports object-level editing, such as insertion or relocation. To enable fair assessment, we provide EvalSuite, a benchmark spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level metrics. On nuScenes, LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency, offering a foundation for LiDAR-based simulation and data augmentation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Depth completion upgrades sparse depth measurements into dense depth maps guided by a conventional image. Existing methods for this highly ill-posed task operate in tightly constrained settings and tend to struggle when applied to images outside the training domain or when the available depth measurements are sparse, irregularly distributed, or of varying density. Inspired by recent advances in monocular depth estimation, we reframe depth completion as an image-conditional depth map generation guided by sparse measurements. Our method, Marigold-DC, builds on a pretrained latent diffusion model for monocular depth estimation and injects the depth observations as test-time guidance via an optimization scheme that runs in tandem with the iterative inference of denoising diffusion. The method exhibits excellent zero-shot generalization across a diverse range of environments and handles even extremely sparse guidance effectively. Our results suggest that contemporary monocular depth priors greatly robustify depth completion: it may be better to view the task as recovering dense depth from (dense) image pixels, guided by sparse depth; rather than as inpainting (sparse) depth, guided by an image.

  Deep Learning models are incredibly data-hungry and require very large labeled datasets for supervised learning. As a consequence, these models often suffer from overfitting, limiting their ability to generalize to real-world examples. Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled the generation of photorealistic images based on textual inputs. Leveraging the substantial datasets used to train these diffusion models, we propose a technique to utilize generated images to augment existing datasets. This paper explores various strategies for effective data augmentation to improve the out-of-domain generalization capabilities of deep learning models.

  Intelligent tableware cleaning is a critical application in food safety and smart homes, but existing methods are limited by coarse-grained classification and scarcity of few-shot data, making it difficult to meet industrialization requirements. We propose DTGen, a few-shot data augmentation scheme based on generative diffusion models, specifically designed for fine-grained dirty tableware recognition. DTGen achieves efficient domain specialization through LoRA, generates diverse dirty images via structured prompts, and ensures data quality through CLIP-based cross-modal filtering. Under extremely limited real few-shot conditions, DTGen can synthesize virtually unlimited high-quality samples, significantly improving classifier performance and supporting fine-grained dirty tableware recognition. We further elaborate on lightweight deployment strategies, promising to transfer DTGen's benefits to embedded dishwashers and integrate with cleaning programs to intelligently regulate energy consumption and detergent usage. Research results demonstrate that DTGen not only validates the value of generative AI in few-shot industrial vision but also provides a feasible deployment path for automated tableware cleaning and food safety monitoring.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating high-quality 360¬∞ panoramic videos remains a significant challenge due to the fundamental differences between panoramic and traditional perspective-view projections. While perspective videos rely on a single viewpoint with a limited field of view, panoramic content requires rendering the full surrounding environment, making it difficult for standard video generation models to adapt. Existing solutions often introduce complex architectures or large-scale training, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal results. Motivated by the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in style transfer tasks, we propose treating panoramic video generation as an adaptation problem from perspective views. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that LoRA can effectively model the transformation between these projections when its rank exceeds the degrees of freedom in the task. Our approach efficiently fine-tunes a pretrained video diffusion model using only approximately 1,000 videos while achieving high-quality panoramic generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains proper projection geometry and surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality, left-right consistency, and motion diversity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules. The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA) module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and (2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas. During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g., realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models with the same backbone in both image qualityand style diversity.

- **[LazyDrag: Enabling Stable Drag-Based Editing on Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers via Explicit Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12203)**  `arXiv:2509.12203`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zixin Yin, Xili Dai, Duomin Wang, Xianfang Zeng, Lionel M. Ni, Gang Yu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The reliance on implicit point matching via attention has become a core bottleneck in drag-based editing, resulting in a fundamental compromise on weakened inversion strength and costly test-time optimization (TTO). This compromise severely limits the generative capabilities of diffusion models, suppressing high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation. In this paper, we introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on implicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit correspondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the attention control. This reliable reference opens the potential for a stable full-strength inversion process, which is the first in the drag-based editing task. It obviates the necessity for TTO and unlocks the generative capability of models. Therefore, LazyDrag naturally unifies precise geometric control with text guidance, enabling complex edits that were previously out of reach: opening the mouth of a dog and inpainting its interior, generating new objects like a ``tennis ball'', or for ambiguous drags, making context-aware changes like moving a hand into a pocket. Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round workflows with simultaneous move and scale operations. Evaluated on the DragBench, our method outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual quality, as validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. LazyDrag not only establishes new state-of-the-art performance, but also paves a new way to editing paradigms.

  Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) retrieves a 3D hyperspectral image (HSI) from a single 2D compressed measurement, which is a highly challenging reconstruction task. Recent deep unfolding networks (DUNs), empowered by explicit data-fidelity updates and implicit deep denoisers, have achieved the state of the art in CASSI reconstruction. However, existing unfolding approaches suffer from uncontrollable reconstruction trajectories, leading to abrupt quality jumps and non-gradual refinement across stages. Inspired by diffusion trajectories and flow matching, we propose a novel trajectory-controllable unfolding framework that enforces smooth, continuous optimization paths from noisy initial estimates to high-quality reconstructions. To achieve computational efficiency, we design an efficient spatial-spectral Transformer tailored for hyperspectral reconstruction, along with a frequency-domain fusion module to gurantee feature consistency. Experiments on simulation and real data demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality and efficiency than prior state-of-the-art approaches.

  Existing talking-head animation approaches based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or diffusion models often suffer from inter-frame flicker, identity drift, and slow inference. These limitations inherent to their video generation pipelines restrict their suitability for applications. To address this, we introduce AvatarSync, an autoregressive framework on phoneme representations that generates realistic and controllable talking-head animations from a single reference image, driven directly text or audio input. In addition, AvatarSync adopts a two-stage generation strategy, decoupling semantic modeling from visual dynamics, which is a deliberate "Divide and Conquer" design. The first stage, Facial Keyframe Generation (FKG), focuses on phoneme-level semantic representation by leveraging the many-to-one mapping from text or audio to phonemes. A Phoneme-to-Visual Mapping is constructed to anchor abstract phonemes to character-level units. Combined with a customized Text-Frame Causal Attention Mask, the keyframes are generated. The second stage, inter-frame interpolation, emphasizes temporal coherence and visual smoothness. We introduce a timestamp-aware adaptive strategy based on a selective state space model, enabling efficient bidirectional context reasoning. To support deployment, we optimize the inference pipeline to reduce latency without compromising visual fidelity. Extensive experiments show that AvatarSync outperforms existing talking-head animation methods in visual fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency, providing a scalable and controllable solution.

  Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation but pose increasing risks in terms of privacy, fairness, and security. A growing demand exists to \emph{erase} sensitive or harmful concepts (e.g., NSFW content, private individuals, artistic styles) from these models while preserving their overall generative capabilities. We introduce \textbf{SCORE} (Secure and Concept-Oriented Robust Erasure), a novel framework for robust concept removal in diffusion models. SCORE formulates concept erasure as an \emph{adversarial independence} problem, theoretically guaranteeing that the model's outputs become statistically independent of the erased concept. Unlike prior heuristic methods, SCORE minimizes the mutual information between a target concept and generated outputs, yielding provable erasure guarantees. We provide formal proofs establishing convergence properties and derive upper bounds on residual concept leakage. Empirically, we evaluate SCORE on Stable Diffusion and FLUX across four challenging benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW removal, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning. SCORE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods including EraseAnything, ANT, MACE, ESD, and UCE, achieving up to \textbf{12.5\%} higher erasure efficacy while maintaining comparable or superior image quality. By integrating adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven fine-tuning, SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in diffusion models.

  Poetry is an expressive form of art that invites multiple interpretations, as readers often bring their own emotions, experiences, and cultural backgrounds into their understanding of a poem. Recognizing this, we aim to generate images for poems and improve these images in a zero-shot setting, enabling audiences to modify images as per their requirements. To achieve this, we introduce a novel Weighted Prompt Manipulation (WPM) technique, which systematically modifies attention weights and text embeddings within diffusion models. By dynamically adjusting the importance of specific words, WPM enhances or suppresses their influence in the final generated image, leading to semantically richer and more contextually accurate visualizations. Our approach exploits diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT in conjunction with existing poetry datasets, ensuring a comprehensive and structured methodology for improved image generation in the literary domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at integrating weighted prompt manipulation for enhancing imagery in poetic language.

  Diffusion models have shown promising results in free-form inpainting. Recent studies based on refined diffusion samplers or novel architectural designs led to realistic results and high data consistency. However, random initialization seed (noise) adopted in vanilla diffusion process may introduce mismatched semantic information in masked regions, leading to biased inpainting results, e.g., low consistency and low coherence with the other unmasked area. To address this issue, we propose the Initial Seed refined Diffusion Model (IS-Diff), a completely training-free approach incorporating distributional harmonious seeds to produce harmonious results. Specifically, IS-Diff employs initial seeds sampled from unmasked areas to imitate the masked data distribution, thereby setting a promising direction for the diffusion procedure. Moreover, a dynamic selective refinement mechanism is proposed to detect severe unharmonious inpaintings in intermediate latent and adjust the strength of our initialization prior dynamically. We validate our method on both standard and large-mask inpainting tasks using the CelebA-HQ, ImageNet, and Places2 datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness across all metrics compared to state-of-the-art inpainting methods.

  In the realm of image generation, the quest for realism and customization has never been more pressing. While existing methods like concept sliders have made strides, they often falter when it comes to no-AIGC images, particularly images captured in real world settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Beyond Sliders, an innovative framework that integrates GANs and diffusion models to facilitate sophisticated image manipulation across diverse image categories. Improved upon concept sliders, our method refines the image through fine grained guidance both textual and visual in an adversarial manner, leading to a marked enhancement in image quality and realism. Extensive experimental validation confirms the robustness and versatility of Beyond Sliders across a spectrum of applications.

  Glioma, an aggressive brain malignancy characterized by rapid progression and its poor prognosis, poses significant challenges for accurate evolution prediction. These challenges are exacerbated by sparse, irregularly acquired longitudinal MRI data in clinical practice, where incomplete follow-up sequences create data imbalances and make reliable modeling difficult. In this paper, we present a multitask diffusion framework for time-agnostic, pixel-wise prediction of glioma progression. The model simultaneously generates future FLAIR sequences at any chosen time point and estimates spatial probabilistic tumor evolution maps derived using signed distance fields (SDFs), allowing uncertainty quantification. To capture temporal dynamics of tumor evolution across arbitrary intervals, we integrate a pretrained deformation module that models inter-scan changes using deformation fields. Regarding the common clinical limitation of data scarcity, we implement a targeted augmentation pipeline that synthesizes complete sequences of three follow-up scans and imputes missing MRI modalities from available patient studies, improving the stability and accuracy of predictive models. Based on merely two follow-up scans at earlier timepoints, our framework produces flexible time-depending probability maps, enabling clinicians to interrogate tumor progression risks at any future temporal milestone. We further introduce a radiotherapy-weighted focal loss term that leverages radiation dose maps, as these highlight regions of greater clinical importance during model training. The proposed method was trained on a public dataset and evaluated on an internal private dataset, achieving promising results in both cases

  We present Stable Part Diffusion 4D (SP4D), a framework for generating paired RGB and kinematic part videos from monocular inputs. Unlike conventional part segmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns to produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object articulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch diffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part segmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different part counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks to continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to share the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to be recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion Fusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a contrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of part predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted to 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few manual adjustments. To train and evaluate SP4D, we construct KinematicParts20K, a curated dataset of over 20K rigged objects selected and processed from Objaverse XL (Deitke et al., 2023), each paired with multi-view RGB and part video sequences. Experiments show that SP4D generalizes strongly to diverse scenarios, including real-world videos, novel generated objects, and rare articulated poses, producing kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream animation and motion-related tasks.

  Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in Human Image Generation (HIG) with various control signals such as pose priors. In HIG, both accurate human poses and coherent visual quality are crucial for image generation. However, most existing methods mainly focus on pose accuracy while neglecting overall image quality, often improving pose alignment at the cost of image quality. To address this, we propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB), implemented as a visual codebook, provides coarse, global guidance based on input text-related visual features, improving pose accuracy while maintaining image quality, while the Dynamic pose Mask (DM) offers fine-grained local control to enhance precise pose accuracy. By injecting KB and DM at different stages of the diffusion process, our framework enhances pose accuracy through both global and local control without compromising image quality. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of KB-DMGen, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on the HumanArt dataset. The project page and code are available atthis https URL.

  Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion, from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches. In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences, compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.

  Recent text-to-image generative models, e.g., Stable Diffusion V3 and Flux, have achieved notable progress. However, these models are strongly restricted to their limited knowledge, a.k.a., their own fixed parameters, that are trained with closed datasets. This leads to significant hallucinations or distortions when facing fine-grained and unseen novel real-world objects, e.g., the appearance of the Tesla Cybertruck. To this end, we present the first real-object-based retrieval-augmented generation framework (RealRAG), which augments fine-grained and unseen novel object generation by learning and retrieving real-world images to overcome the knowledge gaps of generative models. Specifically, to integrate missing memory for unseen novel object generation, we train a reflective retriever by self-reflective contrastive learning, which injects the generator's knowledge into the sef-reflective negatives, ensuring that the retrieved augmented images compensate for the model's missing knowledge. Furthermore, the real-object-based framework integrates fine-grained visual knowledge for the generative models, tackling the distortion problem and improving the realism for fine-grained object generation. Our Real-RAG is superior in its modular application to all types of state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models and also delivers remarkable performance boosts with all of them, such as a gain of 16.18% FID score with the auto-regressive model on the Stanford Car benchmark.

  Semantic image synthesis (SIS) shows good promises for sensor simulation. However, current best practices in this field, based on GANs, have not yet reached the desired level of quality. As latent diffusion models make significant strides in image generation, we are prompted to evaluate ControlNet, a notable method for its dense control capabilities. Our investigation uncovered two primary issues with its results: the presence of weird sub-structures within large semantic areas and the misalignment of content with the semantic mask. Through empirical study, we pinpointed the cause of these problems as a mismatch between the noised training data distribution and the standard normal prior applied at the inference stage. To address this challenge, we developed specific noise priors for SIS, encompassing spatial, categorical, and a novel spatial-categorical joint prior for inference. This approach, which we have named SCP-Diff, has set new state-of-the-art results in SIS on Cityscapes, ADE20K and COCO-Stuff, yielding a FID as low as 10.53 on Cityscapes. The code and models can be accessed via the project page.
