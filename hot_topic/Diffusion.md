- **[DiffAD: A Unified Diffusion Modeling Approach for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12170)**  `arXiv:2503.12170`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has rapidly emerged as a promising approach toward achieving full autonomy. However, existing E2E-AD systems typically adopt a traditional multi-task framework, addressing perception, prediction, and planning tasks through separate task-specific heads. Despite being trained in a fully differentiable manner, they still encounter issues with task coordination, and the system complexity remains high. In this work, we introduce DiffAD, a novel diffusion probabilistic model that redefines autonomous driving as a conditional image generation task. By rasterizing heterogeneous targets onto a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) and modeling their latent distribution, DiffAD unifies various driving objectives and jointly optimizes all driving tasks in a single framework, significantly reducing system complexity and harmonizing task coordination. The reverse process iteratively refines the generated BEV image, resulting in more robust and realistic driving behaviors. Closed-loop evaluations in Carla demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, achieving a new state-of-the-art Success Rate and Driving Score.

  Diffusion models produce impressive results in modalities ranging from images and video to protein design and text. However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we present Feynman-Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models - even with off-the-shelf rewards - can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.

- **[FedDifRC: Unlocking the Potential of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models in Heterogeneous Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06482)**  `arXiv:2507.06482`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning aims at training models collaboratively across participants while protecting privacy. However, one major challenge for this paradigm is the data heterogeneity issue, where biased data preferences across multiple clients, harming the model's convergence and performance. In this paper, we first introduce powerful diffusion models into the federated learning paradigm and show that diffusion representations are effective steers during federated training. To explore the possibility of using diffusion representations in handling data heterogeneity, we propose a novel diffusion-inspired Federated paradigm with Diffusion Representation Collaboration, termed FedDifRC, leveraging meaningful guidance of diffusion models to mitigate data heterogeneity. The key idea is to construct text-driven diffusion contrasting and noise-driven diffusion regularization, aiming to provide abundant class-related semantic information and consistent convergence signals. On the one hand, we exploit the conditional feedback from the diffusion model for different text prompts to build a text-driven contrastive learning strategy. On the other hand, we introduce a noise-driven consistency regularization to align local instances with diffusion denoising representations, constraining the optimization region in the feature space. In addition, FedDifRC can be extended to a self-supervised scheme without relying on any labeled data. We also provide a theoretical analysis for FedDifRC to ensure convergence under non-convex objectives. The experiments on different scenarios validate the effectiveness of FedDifRC and the efficiency of crucial components.

- **[MADI: Masking-Augmented Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling for Visual Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13401)**  `arXiv:2507.13401`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation, their effectiveness in grounded visual editing and compositional control remains challenging. Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning and in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful design choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for structured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the editability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through two core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion (MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines standard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy input from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative and compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and structure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity scaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders inserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference time. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during training further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD. Together, these contributions in MADI substantially enhance the editability of diffusion models, paving the way toward their integration into more general-purpose, in-context generative diffusion architectures.

- **[Generalist Forecasting with Frozen Video Models via Latent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13942)**  `arXiv:2507.13942`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight, task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video understanding.

- **[Improved DDIM Sampling with Moment Matching Gaussian Mixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04938)**  `arXiv:2311.04938`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Prasad Gabbur_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as reverse transition operator (kernel) within the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) framework, which is one of the most widely used approaches for accelerated sampling from pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). Specifically we match the first and second order central moments of the DDPM forward marginals by constraining the parameters of the GMM. We see that moment matching is sufficient to obtain samples with equal or better quality than the original DDIM with Gaussian kernels. We provide experimental results with unconditional models trained on CelebAHQ and FFHQ and class-conditional models trained on ImageNet datasets respectively. Our results suggest that using the GMM kernel leads to significant improvements in the quality of the generated samples when the number of sampling steps is small, as measured by FID and IS metrics. For example on ImageNet 256x256, using 10 sampling steps, we achieve a FID of 6.94 and IS of 207.85 with a GMM kernel compared to 10.15 and 196.73 respectively with a Gaussian kernel.

- **[CSD-VAR: Content-Style Decomposition in Visual Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13984)**  `arXiv:2507.13984`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Quang-Binh Nguyen, Minh Luu, Quang Nguyen, Anh Tran, Khoi Nguyen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Disentangling content and style from a single image, known as content-style decomposition (CSD), enables recontextualization of extracted content and stylization of extracted styles, offering greater creative flexibility in visual synthesis. While recent personalization methods have explored the decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.

- **[Learning Spectral Diffusion Prior for Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13769)**  `arXiv:2507.13769`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Mingyang Yu, Zhijian Wu, Dingjiang Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction aims to recover 3D HSI from its degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover the HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST and BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing networks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI reconstruction.

  _Junsu Kim, Yunhoe Ku, Seungryul Baek_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions. Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.

- **[Inversion-DPO: Precise and Efficient Post-Training for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11554)**  `arXiv:2507.11554`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient, high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to complex realistic generation tasks.

  Text-embedded image generation plays a critical role in industries such as graphic design, advertising, and digital content creation. Text-to-Image generation methods leveraging diffusion models, such as TextDiffuser-2, have demonstrated promising results in producing images with embedded text. TextDiffuser-2 effectively generates bounding box layouts that guide the rendering of visual text, achieving high fidelity and coherence. However, existing approaches often rely on resource-intensive processes and are limited in their ability to run efficiently on both CPU and GPU platforms. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) for rapid and optimized text layout generation with a diffusion-based image synthesis model. Our RL-based approach significantly accelerates the bounding box prediction step while reducing overlaps, allowing the system to run efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and increased flexibility. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and increased flexibility. Our approach has been evaluated on the MARIOEval benchmark, achieving OCR and CLIPScore metrics close to state-of-the-art models, while being 97.64% more faster and requiring only 2MB of memory to run.

- **[FBSDiff: Plug-and-Play Frequency Band Substitution of Diffusion Features for Highly Controllable Text-Driven Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00998)**  `arXiv:2408.00998`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Xiang Gao, Jiaying Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have been a revolutionary milestone in the evolution of generative AI and multimodal technology, allowing wonderful image generation with natural-language text prompt. However, the issue of lacking controllability of such models restricts their practical applicability for real-life content creation. Thus, attention has been focused on leveraging a reference image to control text-to-image synthesis, which is also regarded as manipulating (or editing) a reference image as per a text prompt, namely, text-driven image-to-image translation. This paper contributes a novel, concise, and efficient approach that adapts pre-trained large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to the image-to-image (I2I) paradigm in a plug-and-play manner, realizing high-quality and versatile text-driven I2I translation without any model training, model fine-tuning, or online optimization process. To guide T2I generation with a reference image, we propose to decompose diverse guiding factors with different frequency bands of diffusion features in the DCT spectral space, and accordingly devise a novel frequency band substitution layer which realizes dynamic control of the reference image to the T2I generation result in a plug-and-play manner. We demonstrate that our method allows flexible control over both guiding factor and guiding intensity of the reference image simply by tuning the type and bandwidth of the substituted frequency band, respectively. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of our approach over related methods in I2I translation visual quality, versatility, and controllability.

- **[DiViD: Disentangled Video Diffusion for Static-Dynamic Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13934)**  `arXiv:2507.13934`  `cs.CV`  
  _Marzieh Gheisari, Auguste Genovesio_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.

- **[DynFaceRestore: Balancing Fidelity and Quality in Diffusion-Guided Blind Face Restoration with Dynamic Blur-Level Mapping and Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13797)**  `arXiv:2507.13797`  `cs.CV`  
  _Huu-Phu Do, Yu-Wei Chen, Yi-Cheng Liao, Chi-Wei Hsiao, Han-Yang Wang, Wei-Chen Chiu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion, resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.

  In recent years, large text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models have garnered considerable attention for their abilities to generate videos from textual descriptions. However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion representation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing approaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video frames, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to inconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free Encapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both visual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach utilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video frames by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing them with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to ensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior into the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of both types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach compared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a significant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time. Source codes:this https URL.

- **[PoemTale Diffusion: Minimising Information Loss in Poem to Image Generation with Multi-Stage Prompt Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13708)**  `arXiv:2507.13708`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and diverse visual content. A critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language: poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings. Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced information capture in the generated images.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While burst Low-Resolution (LR) images are useful for improving their Super Resolution (SR) image compared to a single LR image, prior burst SR methods are trained in a deterministic manner, which produces a blurry SR image. Since such blurry images are perceptually degraded, we aim to reconstruct sharp and high-fidelity SR images by a diffusion model. Our method improves the efficiency of the diffusion model with a stochastic sampler with a high-order ODE as well as one-step diffusion using knowledge distillation. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the runtime to 1.6 % of its baseline while maintaining the SR quality measured based on image distortion and perceptual quality.

- **[Learning Deblurring Texture Prior from Unpaired Data with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13599)**  `arXiv:2507.13599`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chengxu Liu, Lu Qi, Jinshan Pan, Xueming Qian, Ming-Hsuan Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Since acquiring large amounts of realistic blurry-sharp image pairs is difficult and expensive, learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is a more practical and promising solution. Unfortunately, dominant approaches rely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to sharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based framework, dubbed \ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying texture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \ours performs DM to generate the prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To implement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a memory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for DM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the Texture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes spatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we implement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture details. Extensive evaluations show that \ours provides a promising unsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used benchmarks.

- **[LoRA-Loop: Closing the Synthetic Replay Cycle for Continual VLM Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13568)**  `arXiv:2507.13568`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kaihong Wang, Donghyun Kim, Margrit Betke_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However, real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage, confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning (MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent progress in transformer-based architectures has demonstrated remarkable success in video generation tasks. However, the quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for high-resolution and long-duration video sequences. In this paper, we propose NABLA, a novel Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that dynamically adapts to sparsity patterns in video diffusion transformers (DiTs). By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold, NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our method does not require custom low-level operator design and can be seamlessly integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline almost without compromising quantitative metrics (CLIP score, VBench score, human evaluation score) and visual quality drop.

- **[AortaDiff: Volume-Guided Conditional Diffusion Models for Multi-Branch Aortic Surface Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13404)**  `arXiv:2507.13404`  `cs.CV`  
  _Delin An, Pan Du, Jian-Xun Wang, Chaoli Wang_

  Accurate 3D aortic construction is crucial for clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, as it enables the estimation of critical hemodynamic parameters such as blood flow velocity, pressure distribution, and wall shear stress. Existing construction methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes, they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour, ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods, including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets, and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for cardiovascular research.

  Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output. In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2) noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.

  Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) systems have highlighted the potential of world models in achieving robust and generalizable performance across both ordinary and challenging driving conditions. However, a key challenge remains: precise and flexible camera pose control, which is crucial for accurate viewpoint transformation and realistic simulation of scene dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PosePilot, a lightweight yet powerful framework that significantly enhances camera pose controllability in generative world models. Drawing inspiration from self-supervised depth estimation, PosePilot leverages structure-from-motion principles to establish a tight coupling between camera pose and video generation. Specifically, we incorporate self-supervised depth and pose readouts, allowing the model to infer depth and relative camera motion directly from video sequences. These outputs drive pose-aware frame warping, guided by a photometric warping loss that enforces geometric consistency across synthesized frames. To further refine camera pose estimation, we introduce a reverse warping step and a pose regression loss, improving viewpoint precision and adaptability. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving and general-domain video datasets demonstrate that PosePilot significantly enhances structural understanding and motion reasoning in both diffusion-based and auto-regressive world models. By steering camera pose with self-supervised depth, PosePilot sets a new benchmark for pose controllability, enabling physically consistent, reliable viewpoint synthesis in generative world models.

  Current diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) approaches achieve commendable performance at the cost of high inference overhead. Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.

  Feature caching has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate diffusion transformer (DiT) sampling through temporal feature reuse. It is a challenging problem since (1) Progressive error accumulation from cached blocks significantly degrades generation quality, particularly when over 50\% of blocks are cached; (2) Current error compensation approaches neglect dynamic perturbation patterns during the caching process, leading to suboptimal error correction. To solve these problems, we propose the Gradient-Optimized Cache (GOC) with two key innovations: (1) Cached Gradient Propagation: A gradient queue dynamically computes the gradient differences between cached and recomputed features. These gradients are weighted and propagated to subsequent steps, directly compensating for the approximation errors introduced by caching. (2) Inflection-Aware Optimization: Through statistical analysis of feature variation patterns, we identify critical inflection points where the denoising trajectory changes direction. By aligning gradient updates with these detected phases, we prevent conflicting gradient directions during error correction. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet demonstrate GOC's superior trade-off between efficiency and quality. With 50\% cached blocks, GOC achieves IS 216.28 (26.3\% higher) and FID 3.907 (43\% lower) compared to baseline DiT, while maintaining identical computational costs. These improvements persist across various cache ratios, demonstrating robust adaptability to different acceleration requirements. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Diffusion Transformer (DiT) is a crucial method for content generation. However, it needs a lot of time to sample. Many studies have attempted to use caching to reduce the time consumption of sampling. Existing caching methods accelerate generation by reusing DiT features from the previous time step and skipping calculations in the next, but they tend to locate and cache low-error modules without focusing on reducing caching-induced errors, resulting in a sharp decline in generated content quality when increasing caching intensity. To solve this problem, we propose the \textbf{E}rror-\textbf{O}ptimized \textbf{C}ache (\textbf{EOC}). This method introduces three key improvements: \textbf{(1)} Prior knowledge extraction: Extract and process the caching differences; \textbf{(2)} A judgment method for cache optimization: Determine whether certain caching steps need to be optimized; \textbf{(3)} Cache optimization: reduce caching errors. Experiments show that this algorithm significantly reduces the error accumulation caused by caching, especially excessive caching. On the ImageNet dataset, without substantially increasing the computational load, this method improves the FID of the generated images when the rule-based model FORA has a caching level of \textbf{75}\%, \textbf{50}\%, and \textbf{25}\%, and the training-based model Learning-to-cache has a caching level of \textbf{22}\%. Specifically, the FID values change from 30.454 to 21.690 (\textbf{28.8}\%), from 6.857 to 5.821 (\textbf{15.1}\%), from 3.870 to 3.692 (\textbf{4.6}\%), and from 3.539 to 3.451 (\textbf{2.5}\%) respectively.

  The advent of neural machine translation (NMT) has revolutionized cross-lingual communication, yet preserving stylistic nuances remains a significant challenge. While existing approaches often require parallel corpora for style preservation, we introduce Babel, a novel framework that enhances stylistic fidelity in NMT using only monolingual corpora. Babel employs two key components: (1) a style detector based on contextual embeddings that identifies stylistic disparities between source and target texts, and (2) a diffusion-based style applicator that rectifies stylistic inconsistencies while maintaining semantic integrity. Our framework integrates with existing NMT systems as a post-processing module, enabling style-aware translation without requiring architectural modifications or parallel stylistic data. Extensive experiments on five diverse domains (law, literature, scientific writing, medicine, and educational content) demonstrate Babel's effectiveness: it identifies stylistic inconsistencies with 88.21% precision and improves stylistic preservation by 150% while maintaining a high semantic similarity score of 0.92. Human evaluation confirms that translations refined by Babel better preserve source text style while maintaining fluency and adequacy.
