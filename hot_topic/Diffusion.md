- **[4CNet: A Diffusion Approach to Map Prediction for Decentralized Multi-Robot Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17904)**  `arXiv:2402.17904`  `cs.RO`

  Mobile robots in unknown cluttered environments with irregularly shaped obstacles often face energy and communication challenges which directly affect their ability to explore these environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, Confidence-Aware Contrastive Conditional Consistency Model (4CNet), for robot map prediction during decentralized, resource-limited multi-robot exploration. 4CNet uniquely incorporates: 1) a conditional consistency model for map prediction in unstructured unknown regions, 2) a contrastive map-trajectory pretraining framework for a trajectory encoder that extracts spatial information from the trajectories of nearby robots during map prediction, and 3) a confidence network to measure the uncertainty of map prediction for effective exploration under resource constraints. We incorporate 4CNet within our proposed robot exploration with map prediction architecture, 4CNet-E. We then conduct extensive comparison studies with 4CNet-E and state-of-the-art heuristic and learning methods to investigate both map prediction and exploration performance in environments consisting of irregularly shaped obstacles and uneven terrain. Results showed that 4CNet-E obtained statistically significant higher prediction accuracy and area coverage with varying environment sizes, number of robots, energy budgets, and communication limitations when compared to database and learning-based methods. Hardware experiments were performed and validated the applicability and generalizability of 4CNet-E in both unstructured indoor and real natural outdoor environments.

- **[TabRep: a Simple and Effective Continuous Representation for Training Tabular Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04798)**  `arXiv:2504.04798`  `cs.LG`

  Diffusion models have been the predominant generative model for tabular data generation. However, they face the conundrum of modeling under a separate versus a unified data representation. The former encounters the challenge of jointly modeling all multi-modal distributions of tabular data in one model. While the latter alleviates this by learning a single representation for all features, it currently leverages sparse suboptimal encoding heuristics and necessitates additional computation costs. In this work, we address the latter by presenting TabRep, a tabular diffusion architecture trained with a unified continuous representation. To motivate the design of our representation, we provide geometric insights into how the data manifold affects diffusion models. The key attributes of our representation are composed of its density, flexibility to provide ample separability for nominal features, and ability to preserve intrinsic relationships. Ultimately, TabRep provides a simple yet effective approach for training tabular diffusion models under a continuous data manifold. Our results showcase that TabRep achieves superior performance across a broad suite of evaluations. It is the first to synthesize tabular data that exceeds the downstream quality of the original datasets while preserving privacy and remaining computationally efficient.

- **[EP-Diffuser: An Efficient Diffusion Model for Traffic Scene Generation and Prediction via Polynomial Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05422)**  `arXiv:2504.05422`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG` `cs.RO`

  As the prediction horizon increases, predicting the future evolution of traffic scenes becomes increasingly difficult due to the multi-modal nature of agent motion. Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach.

- **[Fast constrained sampling in pre-trained diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18804)**  `arXiv:2410.18804`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Alexandros Graikos, Nebojsa Jojic, Dimitris Samaras_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilize backpropagation, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than text-to-image inference, or only enforce the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast and high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We observe that, during inference, we can interchange between gradient updates computed on the noisy image and updates computed on the final, clean image. This allows us to employ a numerical approximation to expensive gradient computations, incurring significant speed-ups in inference. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference approaches while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear and non-linear constraints. An implementation is provided atthis https URL.

- **[Parasite: A Steganography-based Backdoor Attack Framework for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05815)**  `arXiv:2504.05815`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results. You can find our code atthis https URL.

- **[DDT: Decoupled Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05741)**  `arXiv:2504.05741`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion transformers have demonstrated remarkable generation quality, albeit requiring longer training iterations and numerous inference steps. In each denoising step, diffusion transformers encode the noisy inputs to extract the lower-frequency semantic component and then decode the higher frequency with identical modules. This scheme creates an inherent optimization dilemma: encoding low-frequency semantics necessitates reducing high-frequency components, creating tension between semantic encoding and high-frequency decoding. To resolve this challenge, we propose a new \textbf{\color{ddt}D}ecoupled \textbf{\color{ddt}D}iffusion \textbf{\color{ddt}T}ransformer~(\textbf{\color{ddt}DDT}), with a decoupled design of a dedicated condition encoder for semantic extraction alongside a specialized velocity decoder. Our experiments reveal that a more substantial encoder yields performance improvements as model size increases. For ImageNet $256\times256$, Our DDT-XL/2 achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of {1.31 FID}~(nearly $4\times$ faster training convergence compared to previous diffusion transformers). For ImageNet $512\times512$, Our DDT-XL/2 achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.28. Additionally, as a beneficial by-product, our decoupled architecture enhances inference speed by enabling the sharing self-condition between adjacent denoising steps. To minimize performance degradation, we propose a novel statistical dynamic programming approach to identify optimal sharing strategies.

- **[Lumina-OmniLV: A Unified Multimodal Framework for General Low-Level Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04903)**  `arXiv:2504.04903`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yuandong Pu, Le Zhuo, Kaiwen Zhu, Liangbin Xie, Wenlong Zhang, Xiangyu Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Lunima-OmniLV (abbreviated as OmniLV), a universal multimodal multi-task framework for low-level vision that addresses over 100 sub-tasks across four major categories: image restoration, image enhancement, weak-semantic dense prediction, and stylization. OmniLV leverages both textual and visual prompts to offer flexible and user-friendly interactions. Built on Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based generative priors, our framework supports arbitrary resolutions -- achieving optimal performance at 1K resolution -- while preserving fine-grained details and high fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that separately encoding text and visual instructions, combined with co-training using shallow feature control, is essential to mitigate task ambiguity and enhance multi-task generalization. Our findings also reveal that integrating high-level generative tasks into low-level vision models can compromise detail-sensitive restoration. These insights pave the way for more robust and generalizable low-level vision systems.

- **[Diffusion Based Ambiguous Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05977)**  `arXiv:2504.05977`  `cs.CV`

  Medical image segmentation often involves inherent uncertainty due to variations in expert annotations. Capturing this uncertainty is an important goal and previous works have used various generative image models for the purpose of representing the full distribution of plausible expert ground truths. In this work, we explore the design space of diffusion models for generative segmentation, investigating the impact of noise schedules, prediction types, and loss weightings. Notably, we find that making the noise schedule harder with input scaling significantly improves performance. We conclude that x- and v-prediction outperform epsilon-prediction, likely because the diffusion process is in the discrete segmentation domain. Many loss weightings achieve similar performance as long as they give enough weight to the end of the diffusion process. We base our experiments on the LIDC-IDRI lung lesion dataset and obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additionally, we introduce a randomly cropped variant of the LIDC-IDRI dataset that is better suited for uncertainty in image segmentation. Our model also achieves SOTA in this harder setting.

- **[Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection with Diffusion Models via Direct Latent Likelihood Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05662)**  `arXiv:2504.05662`  `cs.CV`  
  _Shunsuke Sakai, Tatsuhito Hasegawa_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models, with their robust distribution approximation capabilities, have demonstrated excellent performance in anomaly detection. However, conventional reconstruction-based approaches rely on computing the reconstruction error between the original and denoised images, which requires careful noise-strength tuning and over ten network evaluations per input-leading to significantly slower detection speeds. To address these limitations, we propose a novel diffusion-based anomaly detection method that circumvents the need for resource-intensive reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing the input image, we directly infer its corresponding latent variables and measure their density under the Gaussian prior distribution. Remarkably, the prior density proves effective as an anomaly score even when using a short partial diffusion process of only 2-5 steps. We evaluate our method on the MVTecAD dataset, achieving an AUC of 0.991 at 15 FPS, thereby setting a new state-of-the-art speed-AUC anomaly detection trade-off.

- **[Tuning-Free Image Editing with Fidelity and Editability via Unified Latent Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05594)**  `arXiv:2504.05594`  `cs.CV`  
  _Qi Mao, Lan Chen, Yuchao Gu, Mike Zheng Shou, Ming-Hsuan Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Balancing fidelity and editability is essential in text-based image editing (TIE), where failures commonly lead to over- or under-editing issues. Existing methods typically rely on attention injections for structure preservation and leverage the inherent text alignment capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models for editability, but they lack explicit and unified mechanisms to properly balance these two objectives. In this work, we introduce UnifyEdit, a tuning-free method that performs diffusion latent optimization to enable a balanced integration of fidelity and editability within a unified framework. Unlike direct attention injections, we develop two attention-based constraints: a self-attention (SA) preservation constraint for structural fidelity, and a cross-attention (CA) alignment constraint to enhance text alignment for improved editability. However, simultaneously applying both constraints can lead to gradient conflicts, where the dominance of one constraint results in over- or under-editing. To address this challenge, we introduce an adaptive time-step scheduler that dynamically adjusts the influence of these constraints, guiding the diffusion latent toward an optimal balance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its superiority in achieving a robust balance between structure preservation and text alignment across various editing tasks, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be available atthis https URL.

- **[Studying Image Diffusion Features for Zero-Shot Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05468)**  `arXiv:2504.05468`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates the use of large-scale diffusion models for Zero-Shot Video Object Segmentation (ZS-VOS) without fine-tuning on video data or training on any image segmentation data. While diffusion models have demonstrated strong visual representations across various tasks, their direct application to ZS-VOS remains underexplored. Our goal is to find the optimal feature extraction process for ZS-VOS by identifying the most suitable time step and layer from which to extract features. We further analyze the affinity of these features and observe a strong correlation with point correspondences. Through extensive experiments on DAVIS-17 and MOSE, we find that diffusion models trained on ImageNet outperform those trained on larger, more diverse datasets for ZS-VOS. Additionally, we highlight the importance of point correspondences in achieving high segmentation accuracy, and we yield state-of-the-art results in ZS-VOS. Finally, our approach performs on par with models trained on expensive image segmentation datasets.

- **[Time-adaptive Video Frame Interpolation based on Residual Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05402)**  `arXiv:2504.05402`  `cs.CV`  
  _Victor Fonte Chavez, Claudia Esteves, Jean-Bernard Hayet_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we propose a new diffusion-based method for video frame interpolation (VFI), in the context of traditional hand-made animation. We introduce three main contributions: The first is that we explicitly handle the interpolation time in our model, which we also re-estimate during the training process, to cope with the particularly large variations observed in the animation domain, compared to natural videos; The second is that we adapt and generalize a diffusion scheme called ResShift recently proposed in the super-resolution community to VFI, which allows us to perform a very low number of diffusion steps (in the order of 10) to produce our estimates; The third is that we leverage the stochastic nature of the diffusion process to provide a pixel-wise estimate of the uncertainty on the interpolated frame, which could be useful to anticipate where the model may be wrong. We provide extensive comparisons with respect to state-of-the-art models and show that our model outperforms these models on animation videos.
