- **[Robust Planning for Autonomous Driving via Mixed Adversarial Diffusion Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12327)**  `arXiv:2505.12327`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We describe a robust planning method for autonomous driving that mixes normal and adversarial agent predictions output by a diffusion model trained for motion prediction. We first train a diffusion model to learn an unbiased distribution of normal agent behaviors. We then generate a distribution of adversarial predictions by biasing the diffusion model at test time to generate predictions that are likely to collide with a candidate plan. We score plans using expected cost with respect to a mixture distribution of normal and adversarial predictions, leading to a planner that is robust against adversarial behaviors but not overly conservative when agents behave normally. Unlike current approaches, we do not use risk measures that over-weight adversarial behaviors while placing little to no weight on low-cost normal behaviors or use hard safety constraints that may not be appropriate for all driving scenarios. We show the effectiveness of our method on single-agent and multi-agent jaywalking scenarios as well as a red light violation scenario.

  Training vision-based manipulation policies that are robust across diverse visual environments remains an important and unresolved challenge in robot learning. Current approaches often sidestep the problem by relying on invariant representations such as point clouds and depth, or by brute-forcing generalization through visual domain randomization and/or large, visually diverse datasets. Disentangled representation learning - especially when combined with principles of associative memory - has recently shown promise in enabling vision-based reinforcement learning policies to be robust to visual distribution shifts. However, these techniques have largely been constrained to simpler benchmarks and toy environments. In this work, we scale disentangled representation learning and associative memory to more visually and dynamically complex manipulation tasks and demonstrate zero-shot adaptability to visual perturbations in both simulation and on real hardware. We further extend this approach to imitation learning, specifically Diffusion Policy, and empirically show significant gains in visual generalization compared to state-of-the-art imitation learning methods. Finally, we introduce a novel technique adapted from the model equivariance literature that transforms any trained neural network policy into one invariant to 2D planar rotations, making our policy not only visually robust but also resilient to certain camera perturbations. We believe that this work marks a significant step towards manipulation policies that are not only adaptable out of the box, but also robust to the complexities and dynamical nature of real-world deployment.

  Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.

  Clear, interpretable instructions are invaluable when attempting any complex task. Good instructions help to clarify the task and even anticipate the steps needed to solve it. In this work, we propose a robot learning framework for communicating, planning, and executing a wide range of tasks, dubbed This&That. This&That solves general tasks by leveraging video generative models, which, through training on internet-scale data, contain rich physical and semantic context. In this work, we tackle three fundamental challenges in video-based planning: 1) unambiguous task communication with simple human instructions, 2) controllable video generation that respects user intent, and 3) translating visual plans into robot actions. This&That uses language-gesture conditioning to generate video predictions, as a succinct and unambiguous alternative to existing language-only methods, especially in complex and uncertain environments. These video predictions are then fed into a behavior cloning architecture dubbed Diffusion Video to Action (DiVA), which outperforms prior state-of-the-art behavior cloning and video-based planning methods by substantial margins.

- **[A Practical Guide for Incorporating Symmetry in Diffusion Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13431)**  `arXiv:2505.13431`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, equivariant neural networks for policy learning have shown promising improvements in sample efficiency and generalization, however, their wide adoption faces substantial barriers due to implementation complexity. Equivariant architectures typically require specialized mathematical formulations and custom network design, posing significant challenges when integrating with modern policy frameworks like diffusion-based models. In this paper, we explore a number of straightforward and practical approaches to incorporate symmetry benefits into diffusion policies without the overhead of full equivariant designs. Specifically, we investigate (i) invariant representations via relative trajectory actions and eye-in-hand perception, (ii) integrating equivariant vision encoders, and (iii) symmetric feature extraction with pretrained encoders using Frame Averaging. We first prove that combining eye-in-hand perception with relative or delta action parameterization yields inherent SE(3)-invariance, thus improving policy generalization. We then perform a systematic experimental study on those design choices for integrating symmetry in diffusion policies, and conclude that an invariant representation with equivariant feature extraction significantly improves the policy performance. Our method achieves performance on par with or exceeding fully equivariant architectures while greatly simplifying implementation.

  Robotic foundation models, or generalist robot policies, hold immense potential to enable flexible, general-purpose and dexterous robotic systems. Despite their advancements, our empirical experiments reveal that existing robot policies are prone to learning spurious correlations from pre-training trajectories, adversely affecting their generalization capabilities beyond the training data. To tackle this, we propose a novel Policy Contrastive Decoding (PCD) approach, which redirects the robot policy's focus toward object-relevant visual clues by contrasting action probability distributions derived from original and object-masked visual inputs. As a training-free method, our PCD can be used as a plugin to improve different types of robot policies without needing to finetune or access model weights. We conduct extensive experiments on top of three open-source robot policies, including the autoregressive policy OpenVLA and the diffusion-based policies Octo and $\pi_0$. The obtained results in both simulation and real-world environments prove PCD's flexibility and effectiveness, e.g., PCD enhances the state-of-the-art policy $\pi_0$ by 8% in the simulation environment and by 108% in the real-world environment.

  Legged robots have the potential to leverage obstacles to climb steep sand slopes. However, efficiently repositioning these obstacles to desired locations is challenging. Here we present DiffusiveGRAIN, a learning-based method that enables a multi-legged robot to strategically induce localized sand avalanches during locomotion and indirectly manipulate obstacles. We conducted 375 trials, systematically varying obstacle spacing, robot orientation, and leg actions in 75 of them. Results show that the movement of closely-spaced obstacles exhibits significant interference, requiring joint modeling. In addition, different multi-leg excavation actions could cause distinct robot state changes, necessitating integrated planning of manipulation and locomotion. To address these challenges, DiffusiveGRAIN includes a diffusion-based environment predictor to capture multi-obstacle movements under granular flow interferences and a robot state predictor to estimate changes in robot state from multi-leg action patterns. Deployment experiments (90 trials) demonstrate that by integrating the environment and robot state predictors, the robot can autonomously plan its movements based on loco-manipulation goals, successfully shifting closely located rocks to desired locations in over 65% of trials. Our study showcases the potential for a locomoting robot to strategically manipulate obstacles to achieve improved mobility on challenging terrains.

- **[MTIL: Encoding Full History with Mamba for Temporal Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12410)**  `arXiv:2505.12410`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yulin Zhou, Yuankai Lin, Fanzhe Peng, Jiahui Chen, Zhuang Zhou, Kaiji Huang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Standard imitation learning (IL) methods have achieved considerable success in robotics, yet often rely on the Markov assumption, limiting their applicability to tasks where historical context is crucial for disambiguating current observations. This limitation hinders performance in long-horizon sequential manipulation tasks where the correct action depends on past events not fully captured by the current state. To address this fundamental challenge, we introduce Mamba Temporal Imitation Learning (MTIL), a novel approach that leverages the recurrent state dynamics inherent in State Space Models (SSMs), specifically the Mamba architecture. MTIL encodes the entire trajectory history into a compressed hidden state, conditioning action predictions on this comprehensive temporal context alongside current multi-modal observations. Through extensive experiments on simulated benchmarks (ACT dataset tasks, Robomimic, LIBERO) and real-world sequential manipulation tasks specifically designed to probe temporal dependencies, MTIL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like ACT and Diffusion Policy. Our findings affirm the necessity of full temporal context for robust sequential decision-making and validate MTIL as a powerful approach that transcends the inherent limitations of Markovian imitation learning

- **[PartDexTOG: Generating Dexterous Task-Oriented Grasping via Language-driven Part Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12294)**  `arXiv:2505.12294`  `cs.RO`  
  _Weishang Wu, Yifei Shi, Zhizhong Chen, Zhipong Cai_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Task-oriented grasping is a crucial yet challenging task in robotic manipulation. Despite the recent progress, few existing methods address task-oriented grasping with dexterous hands. Dexterous hands provide better precision and versatility, enabling robots to perform task-oriented grasping more effectively. In this paper, we argue that part analysis can enhance dexterous grasping by providing detailed information about the object's functionality. We propose PartDexTOG, a method that generates dexterous task-oriented grasps via language-driven part analysis. Taking a 3D object and a manipulation task represented by language as input, the method first generates the category-level and part-level grasp descriptions w.r.t the manipulation task by LLMs. Then, a category-part conditional diffusion model is developed to generate a dexterous grasp for each part, respectively, based on the generated descriptions. To select the most plausible combination of grasp and corresponding part from the generated ones, we propose a measure of geometric consistency between grasp and part. We show that our method greatly benefits from the open-world knowledge reasoning on object parts by LLMs, which naturally facilitates the learning of grasp generation on objects with different geometry and for different manipulation tasks. Our method ranks top on the OakInk-shape dataset over all previous methods, improving the Penetration Volume, the Grasp Displace, and the P-FID over the state-of-the-art by $3.58\%$, $2.87\%$, and $41.43\%$, respectively. Notably, it demonstrates good generality in handling novel categories and tasks.

- **[Learning IMU Bias with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11763)**  `arXiv:2505.11763`  `cs.RO`  
  _Shenghao Zhou, Saimouli Katragadda, Guoquan Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Motion sensing and tracking with IMU data is essential for spatial intelligence, which however is challenging due to the presence of time-varying stochastic bias. IMU bias is affected by various factors such as temperature and vibration, making it highly complex and difficult to model analytically. Recent data-driven approaches using deep learning have shown promise in predicting bias from IMU readings. However, these methods often treat the task as a regression problem, overlooking the stochatic nature of bias. In contrast, we model bias, conditioned on IMU readings, as a probabilistic distribution and design a conditional diffusion model to approximate this distribution. Through this approach, we achieve improved performance and make predictions that align more closely with the known behavior of bias.

- **[EWMBench: Evaluating Scene, Motion, and Semantic Quality in Embodied World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09694)**  `arXiv:2505.09694`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in creative AI have enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images and videos conditioned on language instructions. Building on these developments, text-to-video diffusion models have evolved into embodied world models (EWMs) capable of generating physically plausible scenes from language commands, effectively bridging vision and action in embodied AI applications. This work addresses the critical challenge of evaluating EWMs beyond general perceptual metrics to ensure the generation of physically grounded and action-consistent behaviors. We propose the Embodied World Model Benchmark (EWMBench), a dedicated framework designed to evaluate EWMs based on three key aspects: visual scene consistency, motion correctness, and semantic alignment. Our approach leverages a meticulously curated dataset encompassing diverse scenes and motion patterns, alongside a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation toolkit, to assess and compare candidate models. The proposed benchmark not only identifies the limitations of existing video generation models in meeting the unique requirements of embodied tasks but also provides valuable insights to guide future advancements in the field. The dataset and evaluation tools are publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[VISTA: Generative Visual Imagination for Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07868)**  `arXiv:2505.07868`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yanjia Huang, Mingyang Wu, Renjie Li, Zhengzhong Tu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks agents with locating specific objects in unseen environments using natural language instructions and visual cues. Many existing VLN approaches typically follow an 'observe-and-reason' schema, that is, agents observe the environment and decide on the next action to take based on the visual observations of their surroundings. They often face challenges in long-horizon scenarios due to limitations in immediate observation and vision-language modality gaps. To overcome this, we present VISTA, a novel framework that employs an 'imagine-and-align' navigation strategy. Specifically, we leverage the generative prior of pre-trained diffusion models for dynamic visual imagination conditioned on both local observations and high-level language instructions. A Perceptual Alignment Filter module then grounds these goal imaginations against current observations, guiding an interpretable and structured reasoning process for action selection. Experiments show that VISTA sets new state-of-the-art results on Room-to-Room (R2R) and RoboTHOR benchmarks, e.g.,+3.6% increase in Success Rate on R2R. Extensive ablation analysis underscores the value of integrating forward-looking imagination, perceptual alignment, and structured reasoning for robust navigation in long-horizon environments.

- **[Mean Flows for One-step Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13447)**  `arXiv:2505.13447`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Zhengyang Geng, Mingyang Deng, Xingjian Bai, J. Zico Kolter, Kaiming He_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a principled and effective framework for one-step generative modeling. We introduce the notion of average velocity to characterize flow fields, in contrast to instantaneous velocity modeled by Flow Matching methods. A well-defined identity between average and instantaneous velocities is derived and used to guide neural network training. Our method, termed the MeanFlow model, is self-contained and requires no pre-training, distillation, or curriculum learning. MeanFlow demonstrates strong empirical performance: it achieves an FID of 3.43 with a single function evaluation (1-NFE) on ImageNet 256x256 trained from scratch, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art one-step diffusion/flow models. Our study substantially narrows the gap between one-step diffusion/flow models and their multi-step predecessors, and we hope it will motivate future research to revisit the foundations of these powerful models.

- **[What's Inside Your Diffusion Model? A Score-Based Riemannian Metric to Explore the Data Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11128)**  `arXiv:2505.11128`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Simone Azeglio, Arianna Di Bernardo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated their remarkable ability to capture complex image distributions, but the geometric properties of the learned data manifold remain poorly understood. We address this gap by introducing a score-based Riemannian metric that leverages the Stein score function from diffusion models to characterize the intrinsic geometry of the data manifold without requiring explicit parameterization. Our approach defines a metric tensor in the ambient space that stretches distances perpendicular to the manifold while preserving them along tangential directions, effectively creating a geometry where geodesics naturally follow the manifold's contours. We develop efficient algorithms for computing these geodesics and demonstrate their utility for both interpolation between data points and extrapolation beyond the observed data distribution. Through experiments on synthetic data with known geometry, Rotated MNIST, and complex natural images via Stable Diffusion, we show that our score-based geodesics capture meaningful transformations that respect the underlying data distribution. Our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches on perceptual metrics (LPIPS) and distribution-level metrics (FID, KID), producing smoother, more realistic image transitions. These results reveal the implicit geometric structure learned by diffusion models and provide a principled way to navigate the manifold of natural images through the lens of Riemannian geometry.

  _Cheng Lu, Yuhao Zhou, Fan Bao, Jianfei Chen, Chongxuan Li, Jun Zhu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have achieved impressive success in high-resolution image synthesis, especially in recent large-scale text-to-image generation applications. An essential technique for improving the sample quality of DPMs is guided sampling, which usually needs a large guidance scale to obtain the best sample quality. The commonly-used fast sampler for guided sampling is DDIM, a first-order diffusion ODE solver that generally needs 100 to 250 steps for high-quality samples. Although recent works propose dedicated high-order solvers and achieve a further speedup for sampling without guidance, their effectiveness for guided sampling has not been well-tested before. In this work, we demonstrate that previous high-order fast samplers suffer from instability issues, and they even become slower than DDIM when the guidance scale grows large. To further speed up guided sampling, we propose DPM-Solver++, a high-order solver for the guided sampling of DPMs. DPM-Solver++ solves the diffusion ODE with the data prediction model and adopts thresholding methods to keep the solution matches training data distribution. We further propose a multistep variant of DPM-Solver++ to address the instability issue by reducing the effective step size. Experiments show that DPM-Solver++ can generate high-quality samples within only 15 to 20 steps for guided sampling by pixel-space and latent-space DPMs.

  _Sifeng Shang, Jiayi Zhou, Chenyu Lin, Minxian Li, Kaiyang Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As the size of large language models grows exponentially, GPU memory has become a bottleneck for adapting these models to downstream tasks. In this paper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing memory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a unified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states using zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing weights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize memory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from bfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to quantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete weights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization and re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized Zeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a novel approach that perturbs the continuous quantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative clipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based and codebook-based post-training quantization methods. Compared to full-parameter fine-tuning in bfloat16, QZO can reduce the total memory cost by more than 18$\times$ for 4-bit LLMs, and enables fine-tuning Llama-2-13B and Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large within a single 24GB GPU.

- **[Temporal Distance-aware Transition Augmentation for Offline Model-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13144)**  `arXiv:2505.13144`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.RO`  
  _Dongsu Lee, Minhae Kwon_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The goal of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to extract a high-performance policy from the fixed datasets, minimizing performance degradation due to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Offline model-based RL (MBRL) is a promising approach that ameliorates OOD issues by enriching state-action transitions with augmentations synthesized via a learned dynamics model. Unfortunately, seminal offline MBRL methods often struggle in sparse-reward, long-horizon tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel MBRL framework, dubbed Temporal Distance-Aware Transition Augmentation (TempDATA), that generates augmented transitions in a temporally structured latent space rather than in raw state space. To model long-horizon behavior, TempDATA learns a latent abstraction that captures a temporal distance from both trajectory and transition levels of state space. Our experiments confirm that TempDATA outperforms previous offline MBRL methods and achieves matching or surpassing the performance of diffusion-based trajectory augmentation and goal-conditioned RL on the D4RL AntMaze, FrankaKitchen, CALVIN, and pixel-based FrankaKitchen.

- **[Learning to Learn Weight Generation via Local Consistency Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01117)**  `arXiv:2502.01117`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Yunchuan Guan, Yu Liu, Ke Zhou, Zhiqi Shen, Jenq-Neng Hwang, Lei Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based algorithms have emerged as promising techniques for weight generation. However, existing solutions are limited by two challenges: generalizability and local target assignment. The former arises from the inherent lack of cross-task transferability in existing single-level optimization methods, limiting the model's performance on new tasks. The latter lies in existing research modeling only global optimal weights, neglecting the supervision signals in local target weights. Moreover, naively assigning local target weights causes local-global inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose Mc-Di, which integrates the diffusion algorithm with meta-learning for better generalizability. Furthermore, we extend the vanilla diffusion into a local consistency diffusion algorithm. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that it can learn from local targets while maintaining consistency with the global optima. We validate Mc-Di's superior accuracy and inference efficiency in tasks that require frequent weight updates, including transfer learning, few-shot learning, domain generalization, and large language model adaptation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional performance, yet their iterative sampling procedures remain computationally expensive. A prominent strategy to mitigate this cost is distillation, with offline distillation offering particular advantages in terms of efficiency, modularity, and flexibility. In this work, we identify two key observations that motivate a principled distillation framework: (1) while diffusion models have been viewed through the lens of dynamical systems theory, powerful and underexplored tools can be further leveraged; and (2) diffusion models inherently impose structured, semantically coherent trajectories in latent space. Building on these observations, we introduce the Koopman Distillation Model KDM, a novel offline distillation approach grounded in Koopman theory-a classical framework for representing nonlinear dynamics linearly in a transformed space. KDM encodes noisy inputs into an embedded space where a learned linear operator propagates them forward, followed by a decoder that reconstructs clean samples. This enables single-step generation while preserving semantic fidelity. We provide theoretical justification for our approach: (1) under mild assumptions, the learned diffusion dynamics admit a finite-dimensional Koopman representation; and (2) proximity in the Koopman latent space correlates with semantic similarity in the generated outputs, allowing for effective trajectory alignment. Empirically, KDM achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard offline distillation benchmarks, improving FID scores by up to 40% in a single generation step. All implementation details and code for the experimental setups are provided in our GitHub -this https URL, or in our project page -this https URL.

- **[PhyDA: Physics-Guided Diffusion Models for Data Assimilation in Atmospheric Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12882)**  `arXiv:2505.12882`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Hao Wang, Jindong Han, Wei Fan, Weijia Zhang, Hao Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data Assimilation (DA) plays a critical role in atmospheric science by reconstructing spatially continous estimates of the system state, which serves as initial conditions for scientific analysis. While recent advances in diffusion models have shown great potential for DA tasks, most existing approaches remain purely data-driven and often overlook the physical laws that govern complex atmospheric dynamics. As a result, they may yield physically inconsistent reconstructions that impair downstream applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose PhyDA, a physics-guided diffusion framework designed to ensure physical coherence in atmospheric data assimilation. PhyDA introduces two key components: (1) a Physically Regularized Diffusion Objective that integrates physical constraints into the training process by penalizing deviations from known physical laws expressed as partial differential equations, and (2) a Virtual Reconstruction Encoder that bridges observational sparsity for structured latent representations, further enhancing the model's ability to infer complete and physically coherent states. Experiments on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset demonstrate that PhyDA achieves superior accuracy and better physical plausibility compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our results emphasize the importance of combining generative modeling with domain-specific physical knowledge and show that PhyDA offers a promising direction for improving real-world data assimilation systems.

  Image Generation models are a trending topic nowadays, with many people utilizing Artificial Intelligence models in order to generate images. There are many such models which, given a prompt of a text, will generate an image which depicts said prompt. There are many image generation models, such as Latent Diffusion Models, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, Generative Adversarial Networks and many more. When generating images, these models can generate sensitive image data, which can be threatening to privacy or may violate copyright laws of private entities. Machine unlearning aims at removing the influence of specific data subsets from the trained models and in the case of image generation models, remove the influence of a concept such that the model is unable to generate said images of the concept when prompted. Conventional retraining of the model can take upto days, hence fast algorithms are the need of the hour. In this paper we propose an algorithm that aims to remove the influence of concepts in diffusion models through updating the gradients of the final layers of the text encoders. Using a weighted loss function, we utilize backpropagation in order to update the weights of the final layers of the Text Encoder componet of the Stable Diffusion Model, removing influence of the concept from the text-image embedding space, such that when prompted, the result is an image not containing the concept. The weighted loss function makes use of Textual Inversion and Low-Rankthis http URLperform our experiments on Latent Diffusion Models, namely the Stable Diffusion v2 model, with an average concept unlearning runtime of 50 seconds using 4-5 images.

  Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are critical segments of an antibody that facilitate binding to specific antigens. Current computational methods for CDR design utilize reconstruction losses and do not jointly optimize binding energy, a crucial metric for antibody efficacy. Rather, binding energy optimization is done through computationally expensive Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipelines rely heavily on unreliable binding energy estimators. In this paper, we propose AbFlowNet, a novel generative framework that integrates GFlowNet with Diffusion models. By framing each diffusion step as a state in the GFlowNet framework, AbFlowNet jointly optimizes standard diffusion losses and binding energy by directly incorporating energy signals into the training process, thereby unifying diffusion and reward optimization in a single procedure. Experimental results show that AbFlowNet outperforms the base diffusion model by 3.06% in amino acid recovery, 20.40% in geometric reconstruction (RMSD), and 3.60% in binding energy improvement ratio. ABFlowNet also decreases Top-1 total energy and binding energy errors by 24.8% and 38.1% without pseudo-labeling the test dataset or using computationally expensive online RL regimes.

  While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in static data generation, their deployment in streaming or continual learning (CL) scenarios faces a major challenge: catastrophic forgetting (CF), where newly acquired generative capabilities overwrite previously learned ones. To systematically address this, we introduce a formal Continual Diffusion Generation (CDG) paradigm that characterizes and redefines CL in the context of generative diffusion models. Prior efforts often adapt heuristic strategies from continual classification tasks but lack alignment with the underlying diffusion process. In this work, we develop the first theoretical framework for CDG by analyzing cross-task dynamics in diffusion-based generative modeling. Our analysis reveals that the retention and stability of generative knowledge across tasks are governed by three key consistency criteria: inter-task knowledge consistency (IKC), unconditional knowledge consistency (UKC), and label knowledge consistency (LKC). Building on these insights, we propose Continual Consistency Diffusion (CCD), a principled framework that integrates these consistency objectives into training via hierarchical loss terms $\mathcal{L}_{IKC}$, $\mathcal{L}_{UKC}$, and $\mathcal{L}_{LKC}$. This promotes effective knowledge retention while enabling the assimilation of new generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that CCD achieves state-of-the-art performance under continual settings, with substantial gains in Mean Fidelity (MF) and Incremental Mean Fidelity (IMF), particularly in tasks with rich cross-task knowledge overlap.

  Advanced healthcare predictions offer significant improvements in patient outcomes by leveraging predictive analytics. Existing works primarily utilize various views of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, such as diagnoses, lab tests, or clinical notes, for model training. These methods typically assume the availability of complete EHR views and that the designed model could fully leverage the potential of each view. However, in practice, random missing views and view laziness present two significant challenges that hinder further improvements in multi-view utilization. To address these challenges, we introduce Diffmv, an innovative diffusion-based generative framework designed to advance the exploitation of multiple views of EHR data. Specifically, to address random missing views, we integrate various views of EHR data into a unified diffusion-denoising framework, enriched with diverse contextual conditions to facilitate progressive alignment and view transformation. To mitigate view laziness, we propose a novel reweighting strategy that assesses the relative advantages of each view, promoting a balanced utilization of various data views within the model. Our proposed strategy achieves superior performance across multiple health prediction tasks derived from three popular datasets, including multi-view and multi-modality scenarios.

  Due to the dynamics of underlying physics and external influences, the uncertainty of time series often varies over time. However, existing Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) often fail to capture this non-stationary nature, constrained by their constant variance assumption from the additive noise model (ANM). In this paper, we innovatively utilize the Location-Scale Noise Model (LSNM) to relax the fixed uncertainty assumption of ANM. A diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework, termed Non-stationary Diffusion (NsDiff), is designed based on LSNM that is capable of modeling the changing pattern of uncertainty. Specifically, NsDiff combines a denoising diffusion-based conditional generative model with a pre-trained conditional mean and variance estimator, enabling adaptive endpoint distribution modeling. Furthermore, we propose an uncertainty-aware noise schedule, which dynamically adjusts the noise levels to accurately reflect the data uncertainty at each step and integrates the time-varying variances into the diffusion process. Extensive experiments conducted on nine real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of NsDiff compared to existing approaches. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Diffusion language models offer unique benefits over autoregressive models due to their potential for parallelized generation and controllability, yet they lag in likelihood modeling and are limited to fixed-length generation. In this work, we introduce a class of block diffusion language models that interpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models. Block diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting flexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching and parallel token sampling. We propose a recipe for building effective block diffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of gradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance. Block diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models on language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length sequences.

  Probabilistic forecasting is crucial for real-world spatiotemporal systems, such as climate, energy, and urban environments, where quantifying uncertainty is essential for informed, risk-aware decision-making. While diffusion models have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions, their application to spatiotemporal forecasting remains limited due to complex spatiotemporal dynamics and high computational demands. In this work, we propose CoST, a novel framework that collaborates deterministic and diffusion models for spatiotemporal forecasting. CoST formulates a mean-residual decomposition strategy: it leverages a powerful deterministic model to capture the conditional mean and a lightweight diffusion model to learn residual uncertainties. This collaborative formulation simplifies learning objectives, enhances forecasting accuracy, enables uncertainty quantification, and significantly improves computational efficiency. To address spatial heterogeneity, we further design a scale-aware diffusion mechanism to guide the diffusion process. Extensive experiments across ten real-world datasets from climate, energy, communication, and urban systems show that CoST achieves 25% performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly reducing computational cost.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning generative models from corrupted data is a fundamental yet persistently challenging task across scientific disciplines, particularly when access to clean data is limited or expensive. Denoising Score Distillation (DSD) \cite{chen2025denoising} recently introduced a novel and surprisingly effective strategy that leverages score distillation to train high-fidelity generative models directly from noisy observations. Building upon this foundation, we propose \textit{Restoration Score Distillation} (RSD), a principled generalization of DSD that accommodates a broader range of corruption types, such as blurred, incomplete, or low-resolution images. RSD operates by first pretraining a teacher diffusion model solely on corrupted data and subsequently distilling it into a single-step generator that produces high-quality reconstructions. Empirically, RSD consistently surpasses its teacher model across diverse restoration tasks on both natural and scientific datasets. Moreover, beyond standard diffusion objectives, the RSD framework is compatible with several corruption-aware training techniques such as Ambient Tweedie, Ambient Diffusion, and its Fourier-space variant, enabling flexible integration with recent advances in diffusion modeling. Theoretically, we demonstrate that in a linear regime, RSD recovers the eigenspace of the clean data covariance matrix from linear measurements, thereby serving as an implicit regularizer. This interpretation recasts score distillation not only as a sampling acceleration technique but as a principled approach to enhancing generative performance in severely degraded data regimes.

  Neurosymbolic (NeSy) predictors combine neural perception with symbolic reasoning to solve tasks like visual reasoning. However, standard NeSy predictors assume conditional independence between the symbols they extract, thus limiting their ability to model interactions and uncertainty - often leading to overconfident predictions and poor out-of-distribution generalisation. To overcome the limitations of the independence assumption, we introduce neurosymbolic diffusion models (NeSyDMs), a new class of NeSy predictors that use discrete diffusion to model dependencies between symbols. Our approach reuses the independence assumption from NeSy predictors at each step of the diffusion process, enabling scalable learning while capturing symbol dependencies and uncertainty quantification. Across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks - including high-dimensional visual path planning and rule-based autonomous driving - NeSyDMs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy among NeSy predictors and demonstrate strong calibration.

  Alternators have recently been introduced as a framework for modeling time-dependent data. They often outperform other popular frameworks, such as state-space models and diffusion models, on challenging time-series tasks. This paper introduces a new Alternator model, called Alternator++, which enhances the flexibility of traditional Alternators by explicitly modeling the noise terms used to sample the latent and observed trajectories, drawing on the idea of noise models from the diffusion modeling literature. Alternator++ optimizes the sum of the Alternator loss and a noise-matching loss. The latter forces the noise trajectories generated by the two noise models to approximate the noise trajectories that produce the observed and latent trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Alternator++ in tasks such as density estimation, time series imputation, and forecasting, showing that it outperforms several strong baselines, including Mambas, ScoreGrad, and Dyffusion.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at analyzing graph-structured data but struggle on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different classes. While this challenge is commonly addressed with specialized GNN architectures, graph rewiring remains an underexplored strategy in this context. We provide theoretical foundations linking edge homophily, GNN embedding smoothness, and node classification performance, motivating the need to enhance homophily. Building on this insight, we introduce a rewiring framework that increases graph homophily using a reference graph, with theoretical guarantees on the homophily of the rewired graph. To broaden applicability, we propose a label-driven diffusion approach for constructing a homophilic reference graph from node features and training labels. Through extensive simulations, we analyze how the homophily of both the original and reference graphs influences the rewired graph homophily and downstream GNN performance. We evaluate our method on 11 real-world heterophilic datasets and show that it outperforms existing rewiring techniques and specialized GNNs for heterophilic graphs, achieving improved node classification accuracy while remaining efficient and scalable to large graphs.

  Discovering symbolic differential equations from data uncovers fundamental dynamical laws underlying complex systems. However, existing methods often struggle with the vast search space of equations and may produce equations that violate known physical laws. In this work, we address these problems by introducing the concept of \textit{symmetry invariants} in equation discovery. We leverage the fact that differential equations admitting a symmetry group can be expressed in terms of differential invariants of symmetry transformations. Thus, we propose to use these invariants as atomic entities in equation discovery, ensuring the discovered equations satisfy the specified symmetry. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing equation discovery methods such as sparse regression and genetic programming, improving their accuracy and efficiency. We validate the proposed method through applications to various physical systems, such as fluid and reaction-diffusion, demonstrating its ability to recover parsimonious and interpretable equations that respect the laws of physics.

  Parameter estimation in inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) underpins modeling across scientific disciplines, especially when parameters vary in space or time. Physics-informed Machine Learning (PhiML) integrates PDE constraints into deep learning, but prevailing approaches depend on recursive automatic differentiation (autodiff), which produces inaccurate high-order derivatives, inflates memory usage, and underperforms in noisy settings. We propose Mollifier Layers, a lightweight, architecture-agnostic module that replaces autodiff with convolutional operations using analytically defined mollifiers. This reframing of derivative computation as smoothing integration enables efficient, noise-robust estimation of high-order derivatives directly from network outputs. Mollifier Layers attach at the output layer and require no architectural modifications. We compare them with three distinct architectures and benchmark performance across first-, second-, and fourth-order PDEs -- including Langevin dynamics, heat diffusion, and reaction-diffusion systems -- observing significant improvements in memory efficiency, training time and accuracy for parameter recovery across tasks. To demonstrate practical relevance, we apply Mollifier Layers to infer spatially varying epigenetic reaction rates from super-resolution chromatin imaging data -- a real-world inverse problem with biomedical significance. Our results establish Mollifier Layers as an efficient and scalable tool for physics-constrained learning.

  Extensive research has produced robust methods for unsupervised data visualization. Yet supervised visualization$\unicode{x2013}$where expert labels guide representations$\unicode{x2013}$remains underexplored, as most supervised approaches prioritize classification over visualization. Recently, RF-PHATE, a diffusion-based manifold learning method leveraging random forests and information geometry, marked significant progress in supervised visualization. However, its lack of an explicit mapping function limits scalability and its application to unseen data, posing challenges for large datasets and label-scarce scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Random Forest Autoencoders (RF-AE), a neural network-based framework for out-of-sample kernel extension that combines the flexibility of autoencoders with the supervised learning strengths of random forests and the geometry captured by RF-PHATE. RF-AE enables efficient out-of-sample supervised visualization and outperforms existing methods, including RF-PHATE's standard kernel extension, in both accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, RF-AE is robust to the choice of hyperparameters and generalizes to any kernel-based dimensionality reduction method.

  Current frontier video diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable results at generating high-quality videos. However, they can only generate short video clips, normally around 10 seconds or 240 frames, due to computation limitations during training. Existing methods naively achieve autoregressive long video generation by directly placing the ending of the previous clip at the front of the attention window as conditioning, which leads to abrupt scene changes, unnatural motion, and error accumulation. In this work, we introduce a more natural formulation of autoregressive long video generation by revisiting the noise level assumption in video diffusion models. Our key idea is to 1. assign the frames with per-frame, progressively increasing noise levels rather than a single noise level and 2. denoise and shift the frames in small intervals rather than all at once. This allows for smoother attention correspondence among frames with adjacent noise levels, larger overlaps between the attention windows, and better propagation of information from the earlier to the later frames. Video diffusion models equipped with our progressive noise schedule can autoregressively generate long videos with much improved fidelity compared to the baselines and minimal quality degradation over time. We present the first results on text-conditioned 60-second (1440 frames) long video generation at a quality close to frontier models. Code and video results are available atthis https URL.

  We present a method to control a text-to-image generative model to produce training data useful for supervised learning. Unlike previous works that employ an open-loop approach and pre-define prompts to generate new data using either a language model or human expertise, we develop an automated closed-loop system which involves two feedback mechanisms. The first mechanism uses feedback from a given supervised model and finds adversarial prompts that result in image generations that maximize the model loss. While these adversarial prompts result in diverse data informed by the model, they are not informed of the target distribution, which can be inefficient. Therefore, we introduce the second feedback mechanism that guides the generation process towards a certain target distribution. We call the method combining these two mechanisms Guided Adversarial Prompts. We perform our evaluations on different tasks, datasets and architectures, with different types of distribution shifts (spuriously correlated data, unseen domains) and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed feedback mechanisms compared to open-loop approaches.

  We propose RoPECraft, a training-free video motion transfer method for diffusion transformers that operates solely by modifying their rotary positional embeddings (RoPE). We first extract dense optical flow from a reference video, and utilize the resulting motion offsets to warp the complex-exponential tensors of RoPE, effectively encoding motion into the generation process. These embeddings are then further optimized during denoising time steps via trajectory alignment between the predicted and target velocities using a flow-matching objective. To keep the output faithful to the text prompt and prevent duplicate generations, we incorporate a regularization term based on the phase components of the reference video's Fourier transform, projecting the phase angles onto a smooth manifold to suppress high-frequency artifacts. Experiments on benchmarks reveal that RoPECraft outperforms all recently published methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

  Efficient compression of low-bit-rate point clouds is critical for bandwidth-constrained applications. However, existing techniques mainly focus on high-fidelity reconstruction, requiring many bits for compression. This paper proposes a "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model" (DDPM) architecture for point cloud compression (DDPM-PCC) at low bit-rates. A PointNet encoder produces the condition vector for the generation, which is then quantized via a learnable vector quantizer. This configuration allows to achieve a low bitrates while preserving quality. Experiments on ShapeNet and ModelNet40 show improved rate-distortion at low rates compared to standardized and state-of-the-art approaches. We publicly released the code atthis https URL.

  Despite significant advances in video generation, synthesizing physically plausible human actions remains a persistent challenge, particularly in modeling fine-grained semantics and complex temporal dynamics. For instance, generating gymnastics routines such as "switch leap with 0.5 turn" poses substantial difficulties for current methods, often yielding unsatisfactory results. To bridge this gap, we propose FinePhys, a Fine-grained human action generation framework that incorporates Physics to obtain effective skeletal guidance. Specifically, FinePhys first estimates 2D poses in an online manner and then performs 2D-to-3D dimension lifting via in-context learning. To mitigate the instability and limited interpretability of purely data-driven 3D poses, we further introduce a physics-based motion re-estimation module governed by Euler-Lagrange equations, calculating joint accelerations via bidirectional temporal updating. The physically predicted 3D poses are then fused with data-driven ones, offering multi-scale 2D heatmap guidance for the diffusion process. Evaluated on three fine-grained action subsets from FineGym (FX-JUMP, FX-TURN, and FX-SALTO), FinePhys significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Comprehensive qualitative results further demonstrate FinePhys's ability to generate more natural and plausible fine-grained human actions.

  GPT has shown its remarkable success in natural language processing. However, the language sequence is not sufficient to describe spatial-temporal details in the visual world. Alternatively, the video sequence is good at capturing such details. Motivated by this fact, we propose a concise Video-GPT in this paper by treating video as new language for visual world modeling. By analogy to next token prediction in GPT, we introduce a novel next clip diffusion paradigm for pretraining Video-GPT. Different from the previous works, this distinct paradigm allows Video-GPT to tackle both short-term generation and long-term prediction, by autoregressively denoising the noisy clip according to the clean clips in the history. Extensive experiments show our Video-GPT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on video prediction, which is the key factor towards world modeling (Physics-IQ Benchmark: Video-GPT 34.97 vs. Kling 23.64 vs. Wan 20.89). Moreover, it can be well adapted on 6 mainstream video tasks in both video generation and understanding, showing its great generalization capacity in downstream. The project page is atthis https URL.

  Monocular depth estimation is critical for applications such as autonomous driving and scene reconstruction. While existing methods perform well under normal scenarios, their performance declines in adverse weather, due to challenging domain shifts and difficulties in extracting scene information. To address this issue, we present a robust monocular depth estimation method called \textbf{ACDepth} from the perspective of high-quality training data generation and domain adaptation. Specifically, we introduce a one-step diffusion model for generating samples that simulate adverse weather conditions, constructing a multi-tuple degradation dataset during training. To ensure the quality of the generated degradation samples, we employ LoRA adapters to fine-tune the generation weights of diffusion model. Additionally, we integrate circular consistency loss and adversarial training to guarantee the fidelity and naturalness of the scene contents. Furthermore, we elaborate on a multi-granularity knowledge distillation strategy (MKD) that encourages the student network to absorb knowledge from both the teacher model and pretrained Depth Anything V2. This strategy guides the student model in learning degradation-agnostic scene information from various degradation inputs. In particular, we introduce an ordinal guidance distillation mechanism (OGD) that encourages the network to focus on uncertain regions through differential ranking, leading to a more precise depth estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our ACDepth surpasses md4all-DD by 2.50\% for night scene and 2.61\% for rainy scene on the nuScenes dataset in terms of the absRel metric.

Furthermore, a rule-based method of R-Filter is proposed to filter more informative synthetic data for downstream tasks. We evaluate our EarthSynth on scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation in open-world scenarios, offering a practical solution for advancing RSI interpretation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern video generation frameworks based on Latent Diffusion Models suffer from inefficiencies in tokenization due to the Frame-Proportional Information Assumption. Existing tokenizers provide fixed temporal compression rates, causing the computational cost of the diffusion model to scale linearly with the frame rate. The paper proposes the Duration-Proportional Information Assumption: the upper bound on the information capacity of a video is proportional to the duration rather than the number of frames. Based on this insight, the paper introduces VFRTok, a Transformer-based video tokenizer, that enables variable frame rate encoding and decoding through asymmetric frame rate training between the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, the paper proposes Partial Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to decouple position and content modeling, which groups correlated patches into unified tokens. The Partial RoPE effectively improves content-awareness, enhancing the video generation capability. Benefiting from the compact and continuous spatio-temporal representation, VFRTok achieves competitive reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art generation fidelity while using only 1/8 tokens compared to existing tokenizers.

  Training diffusion models requires large datasets. However, acquiring large volumes of high-quality data can be challenging, for example, collecting large numbers of high-resolution images and long videos. On the other hand, there are many complementary data that are usually considered corrupted or partial, such as low-resolution images and short videos. Other examples of corrupted data include videos that contain subtitles, watermarks, and logos. In this study, we investigate the theoretical problem of whether the above partial data can be utilized to train conventional diffusion models. Motivated by our theoretical analysis in this study, we propose a straightforward approach of training diffusion models utilizing partial data views, where we consider each form of complementary data as a view of conventional data. Our proposed approach first trains one separate diffusion model for each individual view, and then trains a model for predicting the residual score function. We prove generalization error bounds, which show that the proposed diffusion model training approach can achieve lower generalization errors if proper regularizations are adopted in the residual score function training. In particular, we prove that the difficulty in training the residual score function scales proportionally with the signal correlations not captured by partial data views. Consequently, the proposed approach achieves near first-order optimal data efficiency.

  Data augmentation for domain-specific image classification tasks often struggles to simultaneously address diversity, faithfulness, and label clarity of generated data, leading to suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. While existing generative diffusion model-based methods aim to enhance augmentation, they fail to cohesively tackle these three critical aspects and often overlook intrinsic challenges of diffusion models, such as sensitivity to model characteristics and stochasticity under strong transformations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that explicitly integrates diversity, faithfulness, and label clarity into the augmentation process. Our approach employs saliency-guided mixing and a fine-tuned diffusion model to preserve foreground semantics, enrich background diversity, and ensure label consistency, while mitigating diffusion model limitations. Extensive experiments across fine-grained, long-tail, few-shot, and background robustness tasks demonstrate our method's superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches.

Instead of predicting discrete tokens, GPDiT autoregressively predicts future latent frames using a diffusion loss, enabling natural modeling of motion dynamics and semantic consistency across frames. This continuous autoregressive framework not only enhances generation quality but also endows the model with representation capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight causal attention variant and a parameter-free rotation-based time-conditioning mechanism, improving both the training and inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPDiT achieves strong performance in video generation quality, video representation ability, and few-shot learning tasks, highlighting its potential as an effective framework for video modeling in continuous space.

  Text-to-Image models, including Stable Diffusion, have significantly improved in generating images that are highly semantically aligned with the given prompts. However, existing models may fail to produce appropriate images for the cultural concepts or objects that are not well known or underrepresented in western cultures, such as `hangari' (Korean utensil). In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Culturally-Aware Text-to-Image Generation with Iterative Prompt Refinement (Culture-TRIP), which refines the prompt in order to improve the alignment of the image with such culture nouns in text-to-image models. Our approach (1) retrieves cultural contexts and visual details related to the culture nouns in the prompt and (2) iteratively refines and evaluates the prompt based on a set of cultural criteria and large language models. The refinement process utilizes the information retrieved from Wikipedia and the Web. Our user survey, conducted with 66 participants from eight different countries demonstrates that our proposed approach enhances the alignment between the images and the prompts. In particular, C-TRIP demonstrates improved alignment between the generated images and underrepresented culture nouns. Resource can be found atthis https URL.

  Consistency models (CMs) have shown promise in the efficient generation of both image and text. This raises the natural question of whether we can learn a unified CM for efficient multimodal generation (e.g., text-to-image) and understanding (e.g., image-to-text). Intuitively, such a model could be acquired by applying the consistency distillation (CD) to existing unified multimodal models. However, the key challenge is establishing a unified denoising perspective for both image and text generation, which is essential for establishing the consistency mapping. To tackle this, at the representation level, we advocate for discrete tokens for both modalities to best preserve language modeling capabilities. Critically, instead of defining the text denoising trajectory via recent discrete diffusion language modeling principles, we specify it using the parallel decoding trace of an autoregressive language model, benefiting from the latter's superior performance in general text generation tasks. The denoising trajectory of image tokens adheres to standard discrete diffusion. We train our unified consistency models (UniCMs) on these combined multimodal trajectories simultaneously with a unified objective. We introduce a trajectory segmentation strategy to further improve the training convergence. Empirically, in text-to-image generation, UniCMs outperform SD3 on GenEval, Image Reward, and CLIP Score metrics, while requiring only approximately ${1}/{8}$ of the sampling time. Meanwhile, in image-to-text generation, UniCMs surpass Show-o on the MMMU benchmark while being $1.5 \times$ faster at long-sequence generating speed. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Scaling video diffusion transformers (DiTs) is limited by their quadratic 3D attention, even though most of the attention mass concentrates on a small subset of positions. We turn this observation into VSA, a trainable, hardware-efficient sparse attention that replaces full attention at \emph{both} training and inference. In VSA, a lightweight coarse stage pools tokens into tiles and identifies high-weight \emph{critical tokens}; a fine stage computes token-level attention only inside those tiles subjecting to block computing layout to ensure hard efficiency. This leads to a single differentiable kernel that trains end-to-end, requires no post-hoc profiling, and sustains 85\% of FlashAttention3 MFU. We perform a large sweep of ablation studies and scaling-law experiments by pretraining DiTs from 60M to 1.4B parameters. VSA reaches a Pareto point that cuts training FLOPS by 2.53$\times$ with no drop in diffusion loss. Retrofitting the open-source Wan-2.1 model speeds up attention time by 6$\times$ and lowers end-to-end generation time from 31s to 18s with comparable quality. These results establish trainable sparse attention as a practical alternative to full attention and a key enabler for further scaling of video diffusion models.

  Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve remarkable performance within the domain of image generation through the incorporation of the transformer architecture. Conventionally, DiTs are constructed by stacking serial isotropic global information modeling transformers, which face significant computational cost when processing high-resolution images. We empirically analyze that latent space image generation does not exhibit a strong dependence on global information as traditionally assumed. Most of the layers in the model demonstrate redundancy in global computation. In addition, conventional attention mechanisms exhibit low-frequency inertia issues. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{P}seudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{W}indow \textbf{A}ttention (PSWA), which fundamentally mitigates global model redundancy. PSWA achieves intermediate global-local information interaction through window attention, while employing a high-frequency bridging branch to simulate shifted window operations, supplementing appropriate global and high-frequency information. Furthermore, we propose the Progressive Coverage Channel Allocation(PCCA) strategy that captures high-order attention similarity without additional computational cost. Building upon all of them, we propose a series of Pseudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{Win}dow DiTs (\textbf{Swin DiT}), accompanied by extensive experiments demonstrating their superior performance. For example, our proposed Swin-DiT-L achieves a 54%$\uparrow$ FID improvement over DiT-XL/2 while requiring less computational.this https URL

  Many density estimation techniques for 3D human motion prediction require a significant amount of inference time, often exceeding the duration of the predicted time horizon. To address the need for faster density estimation for 3D human motion prediction, we introduce a novel flow-based method for human motion prediction called CacheFlow. Unlike previous conditional generative models that suffer from time efficiency, CacheFlow takes advantage of an unconditional flow-based generative model that transforms a Gaussian mixture into the density of future motions. The results of the computation of the flow-based generative model can be precomputed and cached. Then, for conditional prediction, we seek a mapping from historical trajectories to samples in the Gaussian mixture. This mapping can be done by a much more lightweight model, thus saving significant computation overhead compared to a typical conditional flow model. In such a two-stage fashion and by caching results from the slow flow model computation, we build our CacheFlow without loss of prediction accuracy and model expressiveness. This inference process is completed in approximately one millisecond, making it 4 times faster than previous VAE methods and 30 times faster than previous diffusion-based methods on standard benchmarks such as Human3.6M and AMASS datasets. Furthermore, our method demonstrates improved density estimation accuracy and comparable prediction accuracy to a SOTA method on Human3.6M. Our code and models will be publicly available.

  Diffusion models have made breakthroughs in 3D generation tasks. Current 3D diffusion models focus on reconstructing target shape from images or a set of partial observations. While excelling in global context understanding, they struggle to capture the local details of complex shapes and limited to the occlusion and lighting conditions. To overcome these limitations, we utilize tactile images to capture the local 3D information and propose a Touch2Shape model, which leverages a touch-conditioned diffusion model to explore and reconstruct the target shape from touch. For shape reconstruction, we have developed a touch embedding module to condition the diffusion model in creating a compact representation and a touch shape fusion module to refine the reconstructed shape. For shape exploration, we combine the diffusion model with reinforcement learning to train a policy. This involves using the generated latent vector from the diffusion model to guide the touch exploration policy training through a novel reward design. Experiments validate the reconstruction quality thorough both qualitatively and quantitative analysis, and our touch exploration policy further boosts reconstruction performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There is a growing interest in the use of latent diffusion models (LDMs) for image restoration (IR) tasks due to their ability to model effectively the distribution of natural images. While significant progress has been made, there are still key challenges that need to be addressed. First, many approaches depend on a predefined degradation operator, making them ill-suited for complex or unknown degradations that deviate from standard analytical models. Second, many methods struggle to provide a stable guidance in the latent space and finally most methods convert latent representations back to the pixel domain for guidance at every sampling iteration, which significantly increases computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a wavelet-inspired invertible neural network (INN) that simulates degradations through a forward transform and reconstructs lost details via the inverse transform. We further integrate this design into a latent diffusion pipeline through two proposed approaches: LatentINDIGO-PixelINN, which operates in the pixel domain, and LatentINDIGO-LatentINN, which stays fully in the latent space to reduce complexity. Both approaches alternate between updating intermediate latent variables under the guidance of our INN and refining the INN forward model to handle unknown degradations. In addition, a regularization step preserves the proximity of latent variables to the natural image manifold. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world low-quality images, and can be readily adapted to arbitrary output sizes.

  As Text-to-Image models continue to evolve, so does the risk of generating unsafe, copyrighted, or privacy-violating content. Existing safety interventions - ranging from training data curation and model fine-tuning to inference-time filtering and guidance - often suffer from incomplete concept removal, susceptibility to jail-breaking, computational inefficiency, or collateral damage to unrelated capabilities. In this paper, we introduce CURE, a training-free concept unlearning framework that operates directly in the weight space of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling fast, interpretable, and highly specific suppression of undesired concepts. At the core of our method is the Spectral Eraser, a closed-form, orthogonal projection module that identifies discriminative subspaces using Singular Value Decomposition over token embeddings associated with the concepts to forget and retain. Intuitively, the Spectral Eraser identifies and isolates features unique to the undesired concept while preserving safe attributes. This operator is then applied in a single step update to yield an edited model in which the target concept is effectively unlearned - without retraining, supervision, or iterative optimization. To balance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and preserving unrelated concepts, we further introduce an Expansion Mechanism for spectral regularization which selectively modulates singular vectors based on their relative significance to control the strength of forgetting. All the processes above are in closed-form, guaranteeing extremely efficient erasure in only $2$ seconds. Benchmarking against prior approaches, CURE achieves a more efficient and thorough removal for targeted artistic styles, objects, identities, or explicit content, with minor damage to original generation ability and demonstrates enhanced robustness against red-teaming.

  Recently, significant advances have been made in 3D object generation. Building upon the generated geometry, current pipelines typically employ image diffusion models to generate multi-view RGB images, followed by UV texture reconstruction through texture baking. While 3D geometry generation has improved significantly, supported by multiple open-source frameworks, 3D texture generation remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate 3D texture generation through the lens of three core dimensions: reference-texture alignment, geometry-texture consistency, and local texture quality. To tackle these issues, we propose MVPainter, which employs data filtering and augmentation strategies to enhance texture fidelity and detail, and introduces ControlNet-based geometric conditioning to improve texture-geometry alignment. Furthermore, we extract physically-based rendering (PBR) attributes from the generated views to produce PBR meshes suitable for real-world rendering applications. MVPainter achieves state-of-the-art results across all three dimensions, as demonstrated by human-aligned evaluations. To facilitate further research and reproducibility, we also release our full pipeline as an open-source system, including data construction, model architecture, and evaluation tools.

  Multi-modal object tracking integrates auxiliary modalities such as depth, thermal infrared, event flow, and language to provide additional information beyond RGB images, showing great potential in improving tracking stabilization in complex scenarios. Existing methods typically start from an RGB-based tracker and learn to understand auxiliary modalities only from training data. Constrained by the limited multi-modal training data, the performance of these methods is unsatisfactory. To alleviate this limitation, this work proposes a unified multi-modal tracker Diff-MM by exploiting the multi-modal understanding capability of the pre-trained text-to-image generation model. Diff-MM leverages the UNet of pre-trained Stable Diffusion as a tracking feature extractor through the proposed parallel feature extraction pipeline, which enables pairwise image inputs for object tracking. We further introduce a multi-modal sub-module tuning method that learns to gain complementary information between different modalities. By harnessing the extensive prior knowledge in the generation model, we achieve a unified tracker with uniform parameters for RGB-N/D/T/E tracking. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of our method compared with recently proposed trackers, e.g., its AUC outperforms OneTracker by 8.3% on TNL2K.

  Text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable capabilities in synthesizing images, but often struggle to provide fine-grained control over the output. Existing guidance approaches, such as segmentation maps and depth maps, introduce spatial rigidity that restricts the inherent diversity of diffusion models. In this work, we introduce Deep Geometric Moments (DGM) as a novel form of guidance that encapsulates the subject's visual features and nuances through a learned geometric prior. DGMs focus specifically on the subject itself compared to DINO or CLIP features, which suffer from overemphasis on global image features or semantics. Unlike ResNets, which are sensitive to pixel-wise perturbations, DGMs rely on robust geometric moments. Our experiments demonstrate that DGM effectively balance control and diversity in diffusion-based image generation, allowing a flexible control mechanism for steering the diffusion process.

  Drag-based editing within pretrained diffusion model provides a precise and flexible way to manipulate foreground objects. Traditional methods optimize the input feature obtained from DDIM inversion directly, adjusting them iteratively to guide handle points towards target locations. However, these approaches often suffer from limited accuracy due to the low representation ability of the feature in motion supervision, as well as inefficiencies caused by the large search space required for point tracking. To address these limitations, we present DragLoRA, a novel framework that integrates LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters into the drag-based editing pipeline. To enhance the training of LoRA adapters, we introduce an additional denoising score distillation loss which regularizes the online model by aligning its output with that of the original model. Additionally, we improve the consistency of motion supervision by adapting the input features using the updated LoRA, giving a more stable and accurate input feature for subsequent operations. Building on this, we design an adaptive optimization scheme that dynamically toggles between two modes, prioritizing efficiency without compromising precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DragLoRA significantly enhances the control precision and computational efficiency for drag-based image editing.

  Autoregressive transformers have recently shown impressive image generation quality and efficiency on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models. Unlike diffusion architectures, autoregressive models can naturally incorporate arbitrary modalities into a single, unified token sequence--offering a concise solution for multi-conditional image generation tasks. In this work, we propose $\textbf{ContextAR}$, a flexible and effective framework for multi-conditional image generation. ContextAR embeds diverse conditions (e.g., canny edges, depth maps, poses) directly into the token sequence, preserving modality-specific semantics. To maintain spatial alignment while enhancing discrimination among different condition types, we introduce hybrid positional encodings that fuse Rotary Position Embedding with Learnable Positional Embedding. We design Conditional Context-aware Attention to reduces computational complexity while preserving effective intra-condition perception. Without any fine-tuning, ContextAR supports arbitrary combinations of conditions during inference time. Experimental results demonstrate the powerful controllability and versatility of our approach, and show that the competitive perpormance than diffusion-based multi-conditional control approaches the existing autoregressive baseline across diverse multi-condition driven scenarios.

  The diffusion model has provided a strong tool for implementing text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation. Recently, topology and texture control are popular explorations, e.g., ControlNet, IP-Adapter, Ctrl-X, and DSG. These methods explicitly consider high-fidelity controllable editing based on external signals or diffusion feature manipulations. As for diversity, they directly choose different noise latents. However, the diffused noise is capable of implicitly representing the topological and textural manifold of the corresponding image. Moreover, it's an effective workbench to conduct the trade-off between content preservation and controllable variations. Previous T2I and I2I diffusion works do not explore the information within the compressed contextual latent. In this paper, we first propose a plug-and-play noise finetune NOFT module employed by Stable Diffusion to generate highly correlated and diverse images. We fine-tune seed noise or inverse noise through an optimal-transported (OT) information bottleneck (IB) with around only 14K trainable parameters and 10 minutes of training. Our test-time NOFT is good at producing high-fidelity image variations considering topology and texture alignments. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NOFT is a powerful general reimagine approach to efficiently fine-tune the 2D/3D AIGC assets with text or image guidance.

  Diffusion models have gained attention for their success in modeling complex distributions, achieving impressive perceptual quality in SR tasks. However, existing diffusion-based SR methods often suffer from high computational costs, requiring numerous iterative steps for training and inference. Existing acceleration techniques, such as distillation and solver optimization, are generally task-agnostic and do not fully leverage the specific characteristics of low-level tasks like super-resolution (SR). In this study, we analyze the frequency- and spatial-domain properties of diffusion-based SR methods, revealing key insights into the temporal and spatial dependencies of high-frequency signal recovery. Specifically, high-frequency details benefit from concentrated optimization during early and late diffusion iterations, while spatially textured regions demand adaptive denoising strategies. Building on these observations, we propose the Time-Spatial-aware Sampling strategy (TSS) for the acceleration of Diffusion SR without any extra training cost. TSS combines Time Dynamic Sampling (TDS), which allocates more iterations to refining textures, and Spatial Dynamic Sampling (SDS), which dynamically adjusts strategies based on image content. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TSS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer iterations, improving MUSIQ scores by 0.2 - 3.0 and outperforming the current acceleration methods with only half the number of steps.

  Novel view synthesis (NVS) boosts immersive experiences in computer vision and graphics. Existing techniques, though progressed, rely on dense multi-view observations, restricting their application. This work takes on the challenge of reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes from sparse or single-view inputs. We introduce SpatialCrafter, a framework that leverages the rich knowledge in video diffusion models to generate plausible additional observations, thereby alleviating reconstruction ambiguity. Through a trainable camera encoder and an epipolar attention mechanism for explicit geometric constraints, we achieve precise camera control and 3D consistency, further reinforced by a unified scale estimation strategy to handle scale discrepancies across datasets. Furthermore, by integrating monocular depth priors with semantic features in the video latent space, our framework directly regresses 3D Gaussian primitives and efficiently processes long-sequence features using a hybrid network structure. Extensive experiments show our method enhances sparse view reconstruction and restores the realistic appearance of 3D scenes.

  Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various visual generation tasks, including image, video, and 3D content generation. Preference optimization (PO) is a prominent and growing area of research that aims to align these models with human preferences. While existing PO methods primarily concentrate on producing favorable outputs, they often overlook the significance of classifier-free guidance (CFG) in mitigating undesirable results. Diffusion-NPO addresses this gap by introducing negative preference optimization (NPO), training models to generate outputs opposite to human preferences and thereby steering them away from unfavorable outcomes. However, prior NPO approaches, including Diffusion-NPO, rely on costly and fragile procedures for obtaining explicit preference annotations (e.g., manual pairwise labeling or reward model training), limiting their practicality in domains where such data are scarce or difficult to acquire. In this work, we introduce Self-NPO, a Negative Preference Optimization approach that learns exclusively from the model itself, thereby eliminating the need for manual data labeling or reward model training. Moreover, our method is highly efficient and does not require exhaustive data sampling. We demonstrate that Self-NPO integrates seamlessly into widely used diffusion models, including SD1.5, SDXL, and CogVideoX, as well as models already optimized for human preferences, consistently enhancing both their generation quality and alignment with human preferences.

  Text-guided diffusion models have significantly advanced image editing, enabling highly realistic and local modifications based on textual prompts. While these developments expand creative possibilities, their malicious use poses substantial challenges for detection of such subtle deepfake edits. To this end, we introduce Explain Edit (X-Edit), a novel method for localizing diffusion-based edits in images. To localize the edits for an image, we invert the image using a pretrained diffusion model, then use these inverted features as input to a segmentation network that explicitly predicts the edited masked regions via channel and spatial attention. Further, we finetune the model using a combined segmentation and relevance loss. The segmentation loss ensures accurate mask prediction by balancing pixel-wise errors and perceptual similarity, while the relevance loss guides the model to focus on low-frequency regions and mitigate high-frequency artifacts, enhancing the localization of subtle edits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address and model the problem of localizing diffusion-based modified regions in images. We additionally contribute a new dataset of paired original and edited images addressing the current lack of resources for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that X-Edit accurately localizes edits in images altered by text-guided diffusion models, outperforming baselines in PSNR and SSIM metrics. This highlights X-Edit's potential as a robust forensic tool for detecting and pinpointing manipulations introduced by advanced image editing techniques.

  Diffusion transformers have shown exceptional performance in visual generation but incur high computational costs. Token reduction techniques that compress models by sharing the denoising process among similar tokens have been introduced. However, existing approaches neglect the denoising priors of the diffusion models, leading to suboptimal acceleration and diminished image quality. This study proposes a novel concept: attend to prune feature redundancies in areas not attended by the diffusion process. We analyze the location and degree of feature redundancies based on the structure-then-detail denoising priors. Subsequently, we introduce SDTM, a structure-then-detail token merging approach that dynamically compresses feature redundancies. Specifically, we design dynamic visual token merging, compression ratio adjusting, and prompt reweighting for different stages. Served in a post-training way, the proposed method can be integrated seamlessly into any DiT architecture. Extensive experiments across various backbones, schedulers, and datasets showcase the superiority of our method, for example, it achieves 1.55 times acceleration with negligible impact on image quality.

  We completely discard the conventional spatial prior in image representation and introduce a novel discrete visual tokenizer: Self-consistency Tokenizer (Selftok). At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior -- mirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the reverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok fundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key ways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion and AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok tokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture -- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training objectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman equation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports reinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable to that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA tokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality reconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for both visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any text-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual tokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all the existing models by a large margin. Therefore, we believe that Selftok effectively addresses the long-standing challenge that visual tokens cannot support effective RL. When combined with the well-established strengths of RL in LLMs, this brings us one step closer to realizing a truly multimodal LLM. Project Page:this https URL.

  Creating animatable 3D avatars from a single image remains challenging due to style limitations (realistic, cartoon, anime) and difficulties in handling accessories or hairstyles. While 3D diffusion models advance single-view reconstruction for general objects, outputs often lack animation controls or suffer from artifacts because of the domain gap. We propose SOAP, a style-omniscient framework to generate rigged, topology-consistent avatars from any portrait. Our method leverages a multiview diffusion model trained on 24K 3D heads with multiple styles and an adaptive optimization pipeline to deform the FLAME mesh while maintaining topology and rigging via differentiable rendering. The resulting textured avatars support FACS-based animation, integrate with eyeballs and teeth, and preserve details like braided hair or accessories.

  Recent studies have demonstrated that learning a meaningful internal representation can both accelerate generative training and enhance the generation quality of diffusion transformers. However, existing approaches necessitate to either introduce an external and complex representation training framework or rely on a large-scale, pre-trained representation foundation model to provide representation guidance during the original generative training process. In this study, we posit that the unique discriminative process inherent to diffusion transformers enables them to offer such guidance without requiring external representation components. We therefore propose Self-Representation Alignment (SRA), a simple yet straightforward method that obtains representation guidance through a self-distillation manner. Specifically, SRA aligns the output latent representation of the diffusion transformer in the earlier layer with higher noise to that in the later layer with lower noise to progressively enhance the overall representation learning during only the generative training process. Experimental results indicate that applying SRA to DiTs and SiTs yields consistent performance improvements. Moreover, SRA not only significantly outperforms approaches relying on auxiliary, complex representation training frameworks but also achieves performance comparable to methods that are heavily dependent on powerful external representation priors.

  Recent studies have revealed that text-to-image diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers implant stealthy textual triggers to manipulate model outputs. Previous backdoor detection methods primarily focus on the static features of backdoor samples. However, a vital property of diffusion models is their inherent dynamism. This study introduces a novel backdoor detection perspective named Dynamic Attention Analysis (DAA), showing that these dynamic characteristics serve as better indicators for backdoor detection. Specifically, by examining the dynamic evolution of cross-attention maps, we observe that backdoor samples exhibit distinct feature evolution patterns at the $<$EOS$>$ token compared to benign samples. To quantify these dynamic anomalies, we first introduce DAA-I, which treats the tokens' attention maps as spatially independent and measures dynamic feature using the Frobenius norm. Furthermore, to better capture the interactions between attention maps and refine the feature, we propose a dynamical system-based approach, referred to as DAA-S. This model formulates the spatial correlations among attention maps using a graph-based state equation and we theoretically analyze the global asymptotic stability of this method. Extensive experiments across five representative backdoor attack scenarios demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses existing detection methods, achieving an average F1 Score of 79.49% and an AUC of 87.67%.

  Many existing video inpainting algorithms utilize optical flows to construct the corresponding maps and then propagate pixels from adjacent frames to missing areas by mapping. Despite the effectiveness of the propagation mechanism, they might encounter blurry and inconsistencies when dealing with inaccurate optical flows or large masks. Recently, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as a revolutionary technique for video generation tasks. However, pretrained DiT models for video generation all contain a large amount of parameters, which makes it very time consuming to apply to video inpainting tasks. In this paper, we present DiTPainter, an end-to-end video inpainting model based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT). DiTPainter uses an efficient transformer network designed for video inpainting, which is trained from scratch instead of initializing from any large pretrained models. DiTPainter can address videos with arbitrary lengths and can be applied to video decaptioning and video completion tasks with an acceptable time cost. Experiments show that DiTPainter outperforms existing video inpainting algorithms with higher quality and better spatial-temporal consistency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With diffusion transformer (DiT) excelling in video generation, its use in specific tasks has drawn increasing attention. However, adapting DiT for pose-guided human image animation faces two core challenges: (a) existing U-Net-based pose control methods may be suboptimal for the DiT backbone; and (b) removing text guidance, as in previous approaches, often leads to semantic loss and model degradation. To address these issues, we propose DynamiCtrl, a novel framework for human animation in video DiT architecture. Specifically, we use a shared VAE encoder for human images and driving poses, unifying them into a common latent space, maintaining pose fidelity, and eliminating the need for an expert pose encoder during video denoising. To integrate pose control into the DiT backbone effectively, we propose a novel Pose-adaptive Layer Norm model. It injects normalized pose features into the denoising process via conditioning on visual tokens, enabling seamless and scalable pose control across DiT blocks. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of text removal, we introduce the "Joint-text" paradigm, which preserves the role of text embeddings to provide global semantic context. Through full-attention blocks, image and pose features are aligned with text features, enhancing semantic consistency, leveraging pretrained knowledge, and enabling multi-level control. Experiments verify the superiority of DynamiCtrl on benchmark and self-collected data (e.g., achieving the best LPIPS of 0.166), demonstrating strong character control and high-quality synthesis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-context video modeling is essential for enabling generative models to function as world simulators, as they must maintain temporal coherence over extended time spans. However, most existing models are trained on short clips, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies, even with test-time extrapolation. While training directly on long videos is a natural solution, the rapid growth of vision tokens makes it computationally prohibitive. To support exploring efficient long-context video modeling, we first establish a strong autoregressive baseline called Frame AutoRegressive (FAR). FAR models temporal dependencies between continuous frames, converges faster than video diffusion transformers, and outperforms token-level autoregressive models. Based on this baseline, we observe context redundancy in video autoregression. Nearby frames are critical for maintaining temporal consistency, whereas distant frames primarily serve as context memory. To eliminate this redundancy, we propose the long short-term context modeling using asymmetric patchify kernels, which apply large kernels to distant frames to reduce redundant tokens, and standard kernels to local frames to preserve fine-grained detail. This significantly reduces the training cost of long videos. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on both short and long video generation, providing an effective baseline for long-context autoregressive video modeling.

  Restoring low-resolution text images presents a significant challenge, as it requires maintaining both the fidelity and stylistic realism of the text in restored images. Existing text image restoration methods often fall short in hard situations, as the traditional super-resolution models cannot guarantee clarity, while diffusion-based methods fail to maintain fidelity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at improving the generalization ability of diffusion models for text image super-resolution (SR), especially promoting fidelity. First, we propose a progressive data sampling strategy that incorporates diverse image types at different stages of training, stabilizing the convergence and improving the generalization. For the network architecture, we leverage a pre-trained SR prior to provide robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enhancing the model's ability to preserve textual information. Additionally, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to better integrate textual priors. To further reduce errors in textual priors, we utilize confidence scores to dynamically adjust the importance of textual features during training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only produces text images with more realistic visual appearances but also improves the accuracy of text structure.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents SANA-1.5, a linear Diffusion Transformer for efficient scaling in text-to-image generation. Building upon SANA-1.0, we introduce three key innovations: (1) Efficient Training Scaling: A depth-growth paradigm that enables scaling from 1.6B to 4.8B parameters with significantly reduced computational resources, combined with a memory-efficient 8-bit optimizer. (2) Model Depth Pruning: A block importance analysis technique for efficient model compression to arbitrary sizes with minimal quality loss. (3) Inference-time Scaling: A repeated sampling strategy that trades computation for model capacity, enabling smaller models to match larger model quality at inference time. Through these strategies, SANA-1.5 achieves a text-image alignment score of 0.81 on GenEval, which can be further improved to 0.96 through inference scaling with VILA-Judge, establishing a new SoTA on GenEval benchmark. These innovations enable efficient model scaling across different compute budgets while maintaining high quality, making high-quality image generation more accessible. Our code and pre-trained models are released.

  Text-guided image-to-image diffusion models excel in translating images based on textual prompts, allowing for precise and creative visual modifications. However, such a powerful technique can be misused for spreading misinformation, infringing on copyrights, and evading content tracing. This motivates us to introduce the task of origin IDentification for text-guided Image-to-image Diffusion models (ID$^2$), aiming to retrieve the original image of a given translated query. A straightforward solution to ID$^2$ involves training a specialized deep embedding model to extract and compare features from both query and reference images. However, due to visual discrepancy across generations produced by different diffusion models, this similarity-based approach fails when training on images from one model and testing on those from another, limiting its effectiveness in real-world applications. To solve this challenge of the proposed ID$^2$ task, we contribute the first dataset and a theoretically guaranteed method, both emphasizing generalizability. The curated dataset, OriPID, contains abundant Origins and guided Prompts, which can be used to train and test potential IDentification models across various diffusion models. In the method section, we first prove the existence of a linear transformation that minimizes the distance between the pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) embeddings of generated samples and their origins. Subsequently, it is demonstrated that such a simple linear transformation can be generalized across different diffusion models. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves satisfying generalization performance, significantly surpassing similarity-based methods ($+31.6\%$ mAP), even those with generalization designs.

  Diffusion models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in capturing complex data distributions and have achieved compelling results in many generative tasks. While they have recently been extended to dense prediction tasks such as depth estimation and surface normal prediction, their full potential in this area remains under-explored. In dense prediction settings, target signal maps and input images are pixel-wise aligned. This makes conventional noise-to-data generation paradigm inefficient, as input images can serve as more informative prior compared to pure noise. Diffusion bridge models, which support data-to-data generation between two general data distributions, offer a promising alternative, but they typically fail to exploit the rich visual priors embedded in large pretrained foundation models. To address these limitations, we integrate diffusion bridge formulation with structured visual priors and introduce DPBridge, the first latent diffusion bridge framework for dense prediction tasks. Our method presents three key contributions: (1) a tractable reverse transition kernel for diffusion bridge process, enabling maximum likelihood training scheme for better compatibility with pretrained backbones; (2) a distribution-aligned normalization technique to mitigate the discrepancies between the bridge and standard diffusion processes; and (3) an auxiliary image consistency loss to preserve fine-grained details. Experiments across extensive benchmarks validate that our method consistently achieves superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization capability under different scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models under limited budgets has gained great success. In particular, the recent advances that directly fine-tune the quantized weights using Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) further reduces training costs. Despite these progress, we point out that existing adaptation recipes are not inference-efficient. Specifically, additional post-training quantization (PTQ) on tuned weights is needed during deployment, which results in noticeable performance drop when the bit-width is low. Based on this observation, we introduce IntLoRA, which adapts quantized diffusion models with integer-type low-rank parameters, to include inference efficiency during tuning. Specifically, IntLoRA enables pre-trained weights to remain quantized during training, facilitating fine-tuning on consumer-level GPUs. During inference, IntLoRA weights can be seamlessly merged into pre-trained weights to directly obtain quantized downstream weights without PTQ. Extensive experiments show our IntLoRA achieves significant speedup on both training and inference without losing performance.

  In Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL), we aim to recognize both seen and unseen categories using a model trained only on seen categories. In computer vision, this translates into a classification problem, where knowledge from seen categories is transferred to unseen categories by exploiting the relationships between visual features and available semantic information, such as text corpora or manual annotations. However, learning this joint distribution is costly and requires one-to-one training with corresponding semantic information. We present a reversed conditional Diffusion-based model (RevCD) that mitigates this issue by generating semantic features synthesized from visual inputs by leveraging Diffusion models' conditional mechanisms. Our RevCD model consists of a cross Hadamard-Addition embedding of a sinusoidal time schedule and a multi-headed visual transformer for attention-guided embeddings. The proposed approach introduces three key innovations. First, we reverse the process of generating semantic space based on visual data, introducing a novel loss function that facilitates more efficient knowledge transfer. Second, we apply Diffusion models to zero-shot learning - a novel approach that exploits their strengths in capturing data complexity. Third, we demonstrate our model's performance through a comprehensive cross-dataset evaluation. The complete code will be available on GitHub.

  This paper introduces EasyInv, an easy yet novel approach that significantly advances the field of DDIM Inversion by addressing the inherent inefficiencies and performance limitations of traditional iterative optimization methods. At the core of our EasyInv is a refined strategy for approximating inversion noise, which is pivotal for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the inversion process. By prioritizing the initial latent state, which encapsulates rich information about the original images, EasyInv steers clear of the iterative refinement of noise items. Instead, we introduce a methodical aggregation of the latent state from the preceding time step with the current state, effectively increasing the influence of the initial latent state and mitigating the impact of noise. We illustrate that EasyInv is capable of delivering results that are either on par with or exceed those of the conventional DDIM Inversion approach, especially under conditions where the model's precision is limited or computational resources are scarce. Concurrently, our EasyInv offers an approximate threefold enhancement regarding inference efficiency over off-the-shelf iterative optimization techniques. It can be easily combined with most existing inversion methods by only four lines of code. See code atthis https URL.

  Visual anomaly detection (AD) presents significant challenges due to the scarcity of anomalous data samples. While numerous works have been proposed to synthesize anomalous samples, these synthetic anomalies often lack authenticity or require extensive training data, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose Anomaly Anything (AnomalyAny), a novel framework that leverages Stable Diffusion (SD)'s image generation capabilities to generate diverse and realistic unseen anomalies. By conditioning on a single normal sample during test time, AnomalyAny is able to generate unseen anomalies for arbitrary object types with text descriptions. Within AnomalyAny, we propose attention-guided anomaly optimization to direct SD attention on generating hard anomaly concepts. Additionally, we introduce prompt-guided anomaly refinement, incorporating detailed descriptions to further improve the generation quality. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate AnomalyAny's ability in generating high-quality unseen anomalies and its effectiveness in enhancing downstream AD performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in image inpainting increasingly use generative models to handle large irregular masks. However, these models can create unrealistic inpainted images due to two main issues: (1) Unwanted object insertion: Even with unmasked areas as context, generative models may still generate arbitrary objects in the masked region that don't align with the rest of the image. (2) Color inconsistency: Inpainted regions often have color shifts that causes a smeared appearance, reducing image quality. Retraining the generative model could help solve these issues, but it's costly since state-of-the-art latent-based diffusion and rectified flow models require a three-stage training process: training a VAE, training a generative U-Net or transformer, and fine-tuning for inpainting. Instead, this paper proposes a post-processing approach, dubbed as ASUKA (Aligned Stable inpainting with UnKnown Areas prior), to improve inpainting models. To address unwanted object insertion, we leverage a Masked Auto-Encoder (MAE) for reconstruction-based priors. This mitigates object hallucination while maintaining the model's generation capabilities. To address color inconsistency, we propose a specialized VAE decoder that treats latent-to-image decoding as a local harmonization task, significantly reducing color shifts for color-consistent inpainting. We validate ASUKA on SD 1.5 and FLUX inpainting variants with Places2 and MISATO, our proposed diverse collection of datasets. Results show that ASUKA mitigates object hallucination and improves color consistency over standard diffusion and rectified flow models and other inpainting methods.

  Anomaly detection has garnered extensive applications in real industrial manufacturing due to its remarkable effectiveness and efficiency. However, previous generative-based models have been limited by suboptimal reconstruction quality, hampering their overall performance. We introduce DiffusionAD, a novel anomaly detection pipeline comprising a reconstruction sub-network and a segmentation sub-network. A fundamental enhancement lies in our reformulation of the reconstruction process using a diffusion model into a noise-to-norm paradigm. Here, the anomalous region loses its distinctive features after being disturbed by Gaussian noise and is subsequently reconstructed into an anomaly-free one. Afterward, the segmentation sub-network predicts pixel-level anomaly scores based on the similarities and discrepancies between the input image and its anomaly-free reconstruction. Additionally, given the substantial decrease in inference speed due to the iterative denoising nature of diffusion models, we revisit the denoising process and introduce a rapid one-step denoising paradigm. This paradigm achieves hundreds of times acceleration while preserving comparable reconstruction quality. Furthermore, considering the diversity in the manifestation of anomalies, we propose a norm-guided paradigm to integrate the benefits of multiple noise scales, enhancing the fidelity of reconstructions. Comprehensive evaluations on four standard and challenging benchmarks reveal that DiffusionAD outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches and achieves comparable inference speed, demonstrating the effectiveness and broad applicability of the proposed pipeline.

  Pretrained language models have significantly advanced performance across various natural language processing tasks. However, adversarial attacks continue to pose a critical challenge to systems built using these models, as they can be exploited with carefully crafted adversarial texts. Inspired by the ability of diffusion models to predict and reduce noise in computer vision, we propose a novel and flexible adversarial defense method for language classification tasks, DiffuseDef, which incorporates a diffusion layer as a denoiser between the encoder and the classifier. The diffusion layer is trained on top of the existing classifier, ensuring seamless integration with any model in a plug-and-play manner. During inference, the adversarial hidden state is first combined with sampled noise, then denoised iteratively and finally ensembled to produce a robust text representation. By integrating adversarial training, denoising, and ensembling techniques, we show that DiffuseDef improves over existing adversarial defense methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance against common black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.

  Estimating uncertainty in text-to-image diffusion models is challenging because of their large parameter counts (often exceeding 100 million) and operation in complex, high-dimensional spaces with virtually infinite input possibilities. In this paper, we propose Epistemic Mixture of Experts (EMoE), a novel framework for efficiently estimating epistemic uncertainty in diffusion models. EMoE leverages pre-trained networks without requiring additional training, enabling direct uncertainty estimation from a prompt. We leverage a latent space within the diffusion process that captures epistemic uncertainty better than existing methods. Experimental results on the COCO dataset demonstrate EMoE's effectiveness, showing a strong correlation between uncertainty and image quality. Additionally, EMoE identifies under-sampled languages and regions with higher uncertainty, revealing hidden biases in the training set. This capability demonstrates the relevance of EMoE as a tool for addressing fairness and accountability in AI-generated content.
