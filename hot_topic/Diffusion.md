- **[Unified Video Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00200)**  `arXiv:2503.00200`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`  
  _Shuang Li, Yihuai Gao, Dorsa Sadigh, Shuran Song_

  A unified video and action model holds significant promise for robotics, where videos provide rich scene information for action prediction, and actions provide dynamics information for video prediction. However, effectively combining video generation and action prediction remains challenging, and current video generation-based methods struggle to match the performance of direct policy learning in action accuracy and inference speed. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Unified Video Action model (UVA), which jointly optimizes video and action predictions to achieve both high accuracy and efficient action inference. The key lies in learning a joint video-action latent representation and decoupling video-action decoding. The joint latent representation bridges the visual and action domains, effectively modeling the relationship between video and action sequences. Meanwhile, the decoupled decoding, powered by two lightweight diffusion heads, enables high-speed action inference by bypassing video generation during inference. Such a unified framework further enables versatile functionality through masked input training. By selectively masking actions or videos, a single model can tackle diverse tasks beyond policy learning, such as forward and inverse dynamics modeling and video generation. Via an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that UVA can serve as a general-purpose solution for a wide range of robotics tasks, such as policy learning, forward/inverse dynamics and video observation prediction, without compromising performance compared to methods tailored for specific applications.

- **[Can We Detect Failures Without Failure Data? Uncertainty-Aware Runtime Failure Detection for Imitation Learning Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08558)**  `arXiv:2503.08558`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent years have witnessed impressive robotic manipulation systems driven by advances in imitation learning and generative modeling, such as diffusion- and flow-based approaches. As robot policy performance increases, so does the complexity and time horizon of achievable tasks, inducing unexpected and diverse failure modes that are difficult to predict a priori. To enable trustworthy policy deployment in safety-critical human environments, reliable runtime failure detection becomes important during policy inference. However, most existing failure detection approaches rely on prior knowledge of failure modes and require failure data during training, which imposes a significant challenge in practicality and scalability. In response to these limitations, we present FAIL-Detect, a modular two-stage approach for failure detection in imitation learning-based robotic manipulation. To accurately identify failures from successful training data alone, we frame the problem as sequential out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We first distill policy inputs and outputs into scalar signals that correlate with policy failures and capture epistemic uncertainty. FAIL-Detect then employs conformal prediction (CP) as a versatile framework for uncertainty quantification with statistical guarantees. Empirically, we thoroughly investigate both learned and post-hoc scalar signal candidates on diverse robotic manipulation tasks. Our experiments show learned signals to be mostly consistently effective, particularly when using our novel flow-based density estimator. Furthermore, our method detects failures more accurately and faster than state-of-the-art (SOTA) failure detection baselines. These results highlight the potential of FAIL-Detect to enhance the safety and reliability of imitation learning-based robotic systems as they progress toward real-world deployment.

  _Vitalis Vosylius, Edward Johns_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Following the impressive capabilities of in-context learning with large transformers, In-Context Imitation Learning (ICIL) is a promising opportunity for robotics. We introduce Instant Policy, which learns new tasks instantly (without further training) from just one or two demonstrations, achieving ICIL through two key components. First, we introduce inductive biases through a graph representation and model ICIL as a graph generation problem with a learned diffusion process, enabling structured reasoning over demonstrations, observations, and actions. Second, we show that such a model can be trained using pseudo-demonstrations - arbitrary trajectories generated in simulation - as a virtually infinite pool of training data. Simulated and real experiments show that Instant Policy enables rapid learning of various everyday robot tasks. We also show how it can serve as a foundation for cross-embodiment and zero-shot transfer to language-defined tasks. Code and videos are available atthis https URL.

- **[Neural operators struggle to learn complex PDEs in pedestrian mobility: Hughes model case study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18267)**  `arXiv:2504.18267`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Prajwal Chauhan, Salah Eddine Choutri, Mohamed Ghattassi, Nader Masmoudi, Saif Eddin Jabari_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates the limitations of neural operators in learning solutions for a Hughes model, a first-order hyperbolic conservation law system for crowd dynamics. The model couples a Fokker-Planck equation representing pedestrian density with a Hamilton-Jacobi-type (eikonal) equation. This Hughes model belongs to the class of nonlinear hyperbolic systems that often exhibit complex solution structures, including shocks and discontinuities. In this study, we assess the performance of three state-of-the-art neural operators (Fourier Neural Operator, Wavelet Neural Operator, and Multiwavelet Neural Operator) in various challenging scenarios. Specifically, we consider (1) discontinuous and Gaussian initial conditions and (2) diverse boundary conditions, while also examining the impact of different numerical schemes.Our results show that these neural operators perform well in easy scenarios with fewer discontinuities in the initial condition, yet they struggle in complex scenarios with multiple initial discontinuities and dynamic boundary conditions, even when trained specifically on such complex samples. The predicted solutions often appear smoother, resulting in a reduction in total variation and a loss of important physical features. This smoothing behavior is similar to issues discussed by Daganzo (1995), where models that introduce artificial diffusion were shown to miss essential features such as shock waves in hyperbolic systems. These results suggest that current neural operator architectures may introduce unintended regularization effects that limit their ability to capture transport dynamics governed by discontinuities. They also raise concerns about generalizing these methods to traffic applications where shock preservation is essential.

- **[Fast Autoregressive Models for Continuous Latent Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18391)**  `arXiv:2504.18391`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Tiankai Hang, Jianmin Bao, Fangyun Wei, Dong Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive models have demonstrated remarkable success in sequential data generation, particularly in NLP, but their extension to continuous-domain image generation presents significant challenges. Recent work, the masked autoregressive model (MAR), bypasses quantization by modeling per-token distributions in continuous spaces using a diffusion head but suffers from slow inference due to the high computational cost of the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose the Fast AutoRegressive model (FAR), a novel framework that replaces MAR's diffusion head with a lightweight shortcut head, enabling efficient few-step sampling while preserving autoregressive principles. Additionally, FAR seamlessly integrates with causal Transformers, extending them from discrete to continuous token generation without requiring architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that FAR achieves $2.3\times$ faster inference than MAR while maintaining competitive FID and IS scores. This work establishes the first efficient autoregressive paradigm for high-fidelity continuous-space image generation, bridging the critical gap between quality and scalability in visual autoregressive modeling.

- **[Dual Prompting Image Restoration with Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17825)**  `arXiv:2504.17825`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Dehong Kong, Fan Li, Zhixin Wang, Jiaqi Xu, Renjing Pei, Wenbo Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent state-of-the-art image restoration methods mostly adopt latent diffusion models with U-Net backbones, yet still facing challenges in achieving high-quality restoration due to their limited capabilities. Diffusion transformers (DiTs), like SD3, are emerging as a promising alternative because of their better quality with scalability. In this paper, we introduce DPIR (Dual Prompting Image Restoration), a novel image restoration method that effectivly extracts conditional information of low-quality images from multiple perspectives. Specifically, DPIR consits of two branches: a low-quality image conditioning branch and a dual prompting control branch. The first branch utilizes a lightweight module to incorporate image priors into the DiT with high efficiency. More importantly, we believe that in image restoration, textual description alone cannot fully capture its rich visual characteristics. Therefore, a dual prompting module is designed to provide DiT with additional visual cues, capturing both global context and local appearance. The extracted global-local visual prompts as extra conditional control, alongside textual prompts to form dual prompts, greatly enhance the quality of the restoration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DPIR delivers superior image restoration performance.

- **[DreamID: High-Fidelity and Fast diffusion-based Face Swapping via Triplet ID Group Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14509)**  `arXiv:2504.14509`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Fulong Ye, Miao Hua, Pengze Zhang, Xinghui Li, Qichao Sun, Songtao Zhao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce DreamID, a diffusion-based face swapping model that achieves high levels of ID similarity, attribute preservation, image fidelity, and fast inference speed. Unlike the typical face swapping training process, which often relies on implicit supervision and struggles to achieve satisfactory results. DreamID establishes explicit supervision for face swapping by constructing Triplet ID Group data, significantly enhancing identity similarity and attribute preservation. The iterative nature of diffusion models poses challenges for utilizing efficient image-space loss functions, as performing time-consuming multi-step sampling to obtain the generated image during training is impractical. To address this issue, we leverage the accelerated diffusion model SD Turbo, reducing the inference steps to a single iteration, enabling efficient pixel-level end-to-end training with explicit Triplet ID Group supervision. Additionally, we propose an improved diffusion-based model architecture comprising SwapNet, FaceNet, and ID Adapter. This robust architecture fully unlocks the power of the Triplet ID Group explicit supervision. Finally, to further extend our method, we explicitly modify the Triplet ID Group data during training to fine-tune and preserve specific attributes, such as glasses and face shape. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of identity similarity, pose and expression preservation, and image fidelity. Overall, DreamID achieves high-quality face swapping results at 512*512 resolution in just 0.6 seconds and performs exceptionally well in challenging scenarios such as complex lighting, large angles, and occlusions.

- **[STP4D: Spatio-Temporal-Prompt Consistent Modeling for Text-to-4D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18318)**  `arXiv:2504.18318`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yunze Deng, Haijun Xiong, Bin Feng, Xinggang Wang, Wenyu Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-4D generation is rapidly developing and widely applied in various scenarios. However, existing methods often fail to incorporate adequate spatio-temporal modeling and prompt alignment within a unified framework, resulting in temporal inconsistencies, geometric distortions, or low-quality 4D content that deviates from the provided texts. Therefore, we propose STP4D, a novel approach that aims to integrate comprehensive spatio-temporal-prompt consistency modeling for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Specifically, STP4D employs three carefully designed modules: Time-varying Prompt Embedding, Geometric Information Enhancement, and Temporal Extension Deformation, which collaborate to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, STP4D is among the first methods to exploit the Diffusion model to generate 4D Gaussians, combining the fine-grained modeling capabilities and the real-time rendering process of 4DGS with the rapid inference speed of the Diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STP4D excels in generating high-fidelity 4D content with exceptional efficiency (approximately 4.6s per asset), surpassing existing methods in both quality and speed.

- **[Optimizing Multi-Round Enhanced Training in Diffusion Models for Improved Preference Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18204)**  `arXiv:2504.18204`  `cs.CV`  
  _Kun Li, Jianhui Wang, Yangfan He, Xinyuan Song, Ruoyu Wang, Hongyang He, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative AI has significantly changed industries by enabling text-driven image generation, yet challenges remain in achieving high-resolution outputs that align with fine-grained user preferences. Consequently, multi-round interactions are necessary to ensure the generated images meet expectations. Previous methods enhanced prompts via reward feedback but did not optimize over a multi-round dialogue dataset. In this work, we present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework incorporating human-in-the-loop feedback, leveraging a well-trained reward model aligned with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, our framework applies multiple reward functions, such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback, while fine-tuning the diffusion model through LoRA, thus optimizing image generation based on user input. We also construct multi-round dialogue datasets of prompts and image pairs aligned with user intent. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly improving image consistency and alignment with user intent. Our approach consistently surpasses competing models in user satisfaction, especially in multi-turn dialogue scenarios.

- **[Disentangle Identity, Cooperate Emotion: Correlation-Aware Emotional Talking Portrait Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18087)**  `arXiv:2504.18087`  `cs.CV`  
  _Weipeng Tan, Chuming Lin, Chengming Xu, FeiFan Xu, Xiaobin Hu, Xiaozhong Ji, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Talking Head Generation (THG) have achieved impressive lip synchronization and visual quality through diffusion models; yet existing methods struggle to generate emotionally expressive portraits while preserving speaker identity. We identify three critical limitations in current emotional talking head generation: insufficient utilization of audio's inherent emotional cues, identity leakage in emotion representations, and isolated learning of emotion correlations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework dubbed as DICE-Talk, following the idea of disentangling identity with emotion, and then cooperating emotions with similar characteristics. First, we develop a disentangled emotion embedder that jointly models audio-visual emotional cues through cross-modal attention, representing emotions as identity-agnostic Gaussian distributions. Second, we introduce a correlation-enhanced emotion conditioning module with learnable Emotion Banks that explicitly capture inter-emotion relationships through vector quantization and attention-based feature aggregation. Third, we design an emotion discrimination objective that enforces affective consistency during the diffusion process through latent-space classification. Extensive experiments on MEAD and HDTF datasets demonstrate our method's superiority, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in emotion accuracy while maintaining competitive lip-sync performance. Qualitative results and user studies further confirm our method's ability to generate identity-preserving portraits with rich, correlated emotional expressions that naturally adapt to unseen identities.

- **[Enhancing Privacy-Utility Trade-offs to Mitigate Memorization in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18032)**  `arXiv:2504.18032`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chen Chen, Daochang Liu, Mubarak Shah, Chang Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in creating images highly aligned with user prompts, yet their proclivity for memorizing training set images has sparked concerns about the originality of the generated images and privacy issues, potentially leading to legal complications for both model owners and users, particularly when the memorized images contain proprietary content. Although methods to mitigate these issues have been suggested, enhancing privacy often results in a significant decrease in the utility of the outputs, as indicated by text-alignment scores. To bridge the research gap, we introduce a novel method, PRSS, which refines the classifier-free guidance approach in diffusion models by integrating prompt re-anchoring (PR) to improve privacy and incorporating semantic prompt search (SS) to enhance utility. Extensive experiments across various privacy levels demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the privacy-utility trade-off, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

  _Aniruddha Bala, Rohit Chowdhury, Rohan Jaiswal, Siddharth Roheda_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advancements in diffusion models have enabled effortless image editing via text prompts, raising concerns about image security. Attackers with access to user images can exploit these tools for malicious edits. Recent defenses attempt to protect images by adding a limited noise in the pixel space to disrupt the functioning of diffusion-based editing models. However, the adversarial noise added by previous methods is easily noticeable to the human eye. Moreover, most of these methods are not robust to purification techniques like JPEG compression under a feasible pixel budget. We propose a novel optimization approach that introduces adversarial perturbations directly in the frequency domain by modifying the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients of the input image. By leveraging the JPEG pipeline, our method generates adversarial images that effectively prevent malicious image editing. Extensive experiments across a variety of tasks and datasets demonstrate that our approach introduces fewer visual artifacts while maintaining similar levels of edit protection and robustness to noise purification techniques.

  _Mingxuan Cui, Qing Guo, Yuyi Wang, Hongkai Yu, Di Lin, Qin Zou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful and efficient 3D representation for novel view synthesis. This paper extends 3DGS capabilities to inpainting, where masked objects in a scene are replaced with new contents that blend seamlessly with the surroundings. Unlike 2D image inpainting, 3D Gaussian inpainting (3DGI) is challenging in effectively leveraging complementary visual and semantic cues from multiple input views, as occluded areas in one view may be visible in others. To address this, we propose a method that measures the visibility uncertainties of 3D points across different input views and uses them to guide 3DGI in utilizing complementary visual cues. We also employ uncertainties to learn a semantic concept of scene without the masked object and use a diffusion model to fill masked objects in input images based on the learned concept. Finally, we build a novel 3DGI framework, VISTA, by integrating VISibility-uncerTainty-guided 3DGI with scene conceptuAl learning. VISTA generates high-quality 3DGS models capable of synthesizing artifact-free and naturally inpainted novel views. Furthermore, our approach extends to handling dynamic distractors arising from temporal object changes, enhancing its versatility in diverse scene reconstruction scenarios. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art techniques using two challenging datasets: the SPIn-NeRF dataset, featuring 10 diverse static 3D inpainting scenes, and an underwater 3D inpainting dataset derived from UTB180, including fast-moving fish as inpainting targets.

- **[Spectral Dictionary Learning for Generative Image Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17804)**  `arXiv:2504.17804`  `cs.CV`  
  _Andrew Kiruluta_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel spectral generative model for image synthesis that departs radically from the common variational, adversarial, and diffusion paradigms. In our approach, images, after being flattened into one-dimensional signals, are reconstructed as linear combinations of a set of learned spectral basis functions, where each basis is explicitly parameterized in terms of frequency, phase, and amplitude. The model jointly learns a global spectral dictionary with time-varying modulations and per-image mixing coefficients that quantify the contributions of each spectral component. Subsequently, a simple probabilistic model is fitted to these mixing coefficients, enabling the deterministic generation of new images by sampling from the latent space. This framework leverages deterministic dictionary learning, offering a highly interpretable and physically meaningful representation compared to methods relying on stochastic inference or adversarial training. Moreover, the incorporation of frequency-domain loss functions, computed via the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), ensures that the synthesized images capture both global structure and fine-grained spectral details, such as texture and edge information. Experimental evaluations on the CIFAR-10 benchmark demonstrate that our approach not only achieves competitive performance in terms of reconstruction quality and perceptual fidelity but also offers improved training stability and computational efficiency. This new type of generative model opens up promising avenues for controlled synthesis, as the learned spectral dictionary affords a direct handle on the intrinsic frequency content of the images, thus providing enhanced interpretability and potential for novel applications in image manipulation and analysis.

  _Haoyu Wu, Jingyi Xu, Hieu Le, Dimitris Samaras_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Token merging can effectively accelerate various vision systems by processing groups of similar tokens only once and sharing the results across them. However, existing token grouping methods are often ad hoc and random, disregarding the actual content of the samples. We show that preserving high-information tokens during merging - those essential for semantic fidelity and structural details - significantly improves sample quality, producing finer details and more coherent, realistic generations. Despite being simple and intuitive, this approach remains underexplored.To do so, we propose an importance-based token merging method that prioritizes the most critical tokens in computational resource allocation, leveraging readily available importance scores, such as those from classifier-free guidance in diffusion models. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple applications, including text-to-image synthesis, multi-view image generation, and video generation with various model architectures such as Stable Diffusion, Zero123++, AnimateDiff, or PixArt-$\alpha$.

  Diffusion models, widely used for image and video generation, face a significant limitation: the risk of memorizing and reproducing training data during inference, potentially generating unauthorized copyrighted content. While prior research has focused on image diffusion models (IDMs), video diffusion models (VDMs) remain underexplored. To address this gap, we first formally define the two types of memorization in VDMs (content memorization and motion memorization) in a practical way that focuses on privacy preservation and applies to all generation types. We then introduce new metrics specifically designed to separately assess content and motion memorization in VDMs. Additionally, we curate a dataset of text prompts that are most prone to triggering memorization when used as conditioning in VDMs. By leveraging these prompts, we generate diverse videos from various open-source VDMs, successfully extracting numerous training videos from each tested model. Through the application of our proposed metrics, we systematically analyze memorization across various pretrained VDMs, including text-conditional and unconditional models, on a variety of datasets. Our comprehensive study reveals that memorization is widespread across all tested VDMs, indicating that VDMs can also memorize image training data in addition to video datasets. Finally, we propose efficient and effective detection strategies for both content and motion memorization, offering a foundational approach for improving privacy in VDMs.

- **[Exploring Local Memorization in Diffusion Models via Bright Ending Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21665)**  `arXiv:2410.21665`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chen Chen, Daochang Liu, Mubarak Shah, Chang Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved unprecedented proficiency in generating realistic images. However, their inherent tendency to memorize and replicate training data during inference raises significant concerns, including potential copyright infringement. In response, various methods have been proposed to evaluate, detect, and mitigate memorization. Our analysis reveals that existing approaches significantly underperform in handling local memorization, where only specific image regions are memorized, compared to global memorization, where the entire image is replicated. Also, they cannot locate the local memorization regions, making it hard to investigate locally. To address these, we identify a novel "bright ending" (BE) anomaly in diffusion models prone to memorizing training images. BE refers to a distinct cross-attention pattern observed in text-to-image diffusion models, where memorized image patches exhibit significantly greater attention to the final text token during the last inference step than non-memorized patches. This pattern highlights regions where the generated image replicates training data and enables efficient localization of memorized regions. Equipped with this, we propose a simple yet effective method to integrate BE into existing frameworks, significantly improving their performance by narrowing the performance gap caused by local memorization. Our results not only validate the successful execution of the new localization task but also establish new state-of-the-art performance across all existing tasks, underscoring the significance of the BE phenomenon.

- **[Improving Consistency in Diffusion Models for Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13807)**  `arXiv:2410.13807`  `cs.CV`  
  _Junhao Gu, Peng-Tao Jiang, Hao Zhang, Mi Zhou, Jinwei Chen, Wenming Yang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent methods exploit the powerful text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models for real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) and achieve impressive results compared to previous models. However, we observe two kinds of inconsistencies in diffusion-based methods which hinder existing models from fully exploiting diffusion priors. The first is the semantic inconsistency arising from diffusion guidance. T2I generation focuses on semantic-level consistency with text prompts, while Real-ISR emphasizes pixel-level reconstruction from low-quality (LQ) images, necessitating more detailed semantic guidance from LQ inputs. The second is the training-inference inconsistency stemming from the DDPM, which improperly assumes high-quality (HQ) latent corrupted by Gaussian noise as denoising inputs for each timestep. To address these issues, we introduce ConsisSR to handle both semantic and training-inference consistencies. On the one hand, to address the semantic inconsistency, we proposed a Hybrid Prompt Adapter (HPA). Instead of text prompts with coarse-grained classification information, we leverage the more powerful CLIP image embeddings to explore additional color and texture guidance. On the other hand, we introduce Time-Aware Latent Augmentation (TALA) to bridge the training-inference inconsistency. Based on the probability function p(t), we accordingly enhance the SDSR training strategy. With LQ latent with Gaussian noise as inputs, our TALA not only focuses on diffusion noise but also refine the LQ latent towards the HQ counterpart. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance among existing diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

  Generating speech-driven 3D talking heads presents numerous challenges; among those is dealing with varying mesh topologies where no point-wise correspondence exists across all meshes the model can animate. While simplifying the problem, it limits applicability as unseen meshes must adhere to the training topology. This work presents a framework capable of animating 3D faces in arbitrary topologies, including real scanned data. Our approach relies on a model leveraging heat diffusion to predict features robust to the mesh topology. We explore two training settings: a registered one, in which meshes in a training sequences share a fixed topology but any mesh can be animated at test time, and an fully unregistered one, which allows effective training with varying mesh structures. Additionally, we highlight the limitations of current evaluation metrics and propose new metrics for better lip-syncing evaluation between speech and facial movements. Our extensive evaluation shows our approach performs favorably compared to fixed topology techniques, setting a new benchmark by offering a versatile and high-fidelity solution for 3D talking head generation where the topology constraint is dropped.

- **[Towards Synchronous Memorizability and Generalizability with Site-Modulated Diffusion Replay for Cross-Site Continual Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18037)**  `arXiv:2406.18037`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to learn sequentially from different data sites is crucial for a deep network in solving practical medical image diagnosis problems due to privacy restrictions and storage limitations. However, adapting on incoming site leads to catastrophic forgetting on past sites and decreases generalizablity on unseen sites. Existing Continual Learning (CL) and Domain Generalization (DG) methods have been proposed to solve these two challenges respectively, but none of them can address both simultaneously. Recognizing this limitation, this paper proposes a novel training paradigm, learning towards Synchronous Memorizability and Generalizability (SMG-Learning). To achieve this, we create the orientational gradient alignment to ensure memorizability on previous sites, and arbitrary gradient alignment to enhance generalizability on unseen sites. This approach is named as Parallel Gradient Alignment (PGA). Furthermore, we approximate the PGA as dual meta-objectives using the first-order Taylor expansion to reduce computational cost of aligning gradients. Considering that performing gradient alignments, especially for previous sites, is not feasible due to the privacy constraints, we design a Site-Modulated Diffusion (SMD) model to generate images with site-specific learnable prompts, replaying images have similar data distributions as previous sites. We evaluate our method on two medical image segmentation tasks, where data from different sites arrive sequentially. Experimental results show that our method efficiently enhances both memorizability and generalizablity better than other state-of-the-art methods, delivering satisfactory performance across all sites.

  Deriving co-speech 3D gestures has seen tremendous progress in virtual avatar animation. Yet, the existing methods often produce stiff and unreasonable gestures with unseen human speech inputs due to the limited 3D speech-gesture data. In this paper, we propose CoCoGesture, a novel framework enabling vivid and diverse gesture synthesis from unseen human speech prompts. Our key insight is built upon the custom-designed pretrain-fintune training paradigm. At the pretraining stage, we aim to formulate a large generalizable gesture diffusion model by learning the abundant postures manifold. Therefore, to alleviate the scarcity of 3D data, we first construct a large-scale co-speech 3D gesture dataset containing more than 40M meshed posture instances across 4.3K speakers, dubbed GES-X. Then, we scale up the large unconditional diffusion model to 1B parameters and pre-train it to be our gesture experts. At the finetune stage, we present the audio ControlNet that incorporates the human voice as condition prompts to guide the gesture generation. Here, we construct the audio ControlNet through a trainable copy of our pre-trained diffusion model. Moreover, we design a novel Mixture-of-Gesture-Experts (MoGE) block to adaptively fuse the audio embedding from the human speech and the gesture features from the pre-trained gesture experts with a routing mechanism. Such an effective manner ensures audio embedding is temporal coordinated with motion features while preserving the vivid and diverse gesture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CoCoGesture outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the zero-shot speech-to-gesture generation.

  Recent generative models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating realistic and visually pleasing images grounded on textual prompts. Nevertheless, a significant challenge remains in applying these models for the more intricate task of story visualization. Since it requires resolving pronouns (he, she, they) in the frame descriptions, i.e., anaphora resolution, and ensuring consistent characters and background synthesis across frames. Yet, the emerging Large Language Model (LLM) showcases robust reasoning abilities to navigate through ambiguous references and process extensive sequences. Therefore, we introduce \emph{StoryGPT-V}, which leverages the merits of the latent diffusion (LDM) and LLM to produce images with consistent and high-quality characters grounded on given story descriptions. First, we train a character-aware LDM, which takes character-augmented semantic embedding as input and includes the supervision of the cross-attention map using character segmentation masks, aiming to enhance character generation accuracy and faithfulness. In the second stage, we enable an alignment between the output of LLM and the character-augmented embedding residing in the input space of the first-stage model. This harnesses the reasoning ability of LLM to address ambiguous references and the comprehension capability to memorize the context. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two visual story visualization benchmarks. Our model reports superior quantitative results and consistently generates accurate characters of remarkable quality with low memory consumption.
