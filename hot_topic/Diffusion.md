- **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528)**  `arXiv:2505.11528`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.

- **[DISCO: Language-Guided Manipulation with Diffusion Policies and Constrained Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09767)**  `arXiv:2406.09767`  `cs.RO`  
  _Ce Hao, Kelvin Lin, Zhiwei Xue, Siyuan Luo, Harold Soh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion policies have demonstrated strong performance in generative modeling, making them promising for robotic manipulation guided by natural language instructions. However, generalizing language-conditioned diffusion policies to open-vocabulary instructions in everyday scenarios remains challenging due to the scarcity and cost of robot demonstration datasets. To address this, we propose DISCO, a framework that leverages off-the-shelf vision-language models (VLMs) to bridge natural language understanding with high-performance diffusion policies. DISCO translates linguistic task descriptions into actionable 3D keyframes using VLMs, which then guide the diffusion process through constrained inpainting. However, enforcing strict adherence to these keyframes can degrade performance when the VLM-generated keyframes are inaccurate. To mitigate this, we introduce an inpainting optimization strategy that balances keyframe adherence with learned motion priors from training data. Experimental results in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that DISCO outperforms conventional fine-tuned language-conditioned policies, achieving superior generalization in zero-shot, open-vocabulary manipulation tasks.

- **[EventTSF: Event-Aware Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13434)**  `arXiv:2508.13434`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yunfeng Ge, Ming Jin, Yiji Zhao, Hongyan Li, Bo Du, Chang Xu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality, resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF), an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions. Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.

- **[Understanding and Mitigating Memorization in Generative Models via Sharpness of Probability Landscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04140)**  `arXiv:2412.04140`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Dongjae Jeon, Dueun Kim, Albert No_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce a geometric framework to analyze memorization in diffusion models through the sharpness of the log probability density. We mathematically justify a previously proposed score-difference-based memorization metric by demonstrating its effectiveness in quantifying sharpness. Additionally, we propose a novel memorization metric that captures sharpness at the initial stage of image generation in latent diffusion models, offering early insights into potential memorization. Leveraging this metric, we develop a mitigation strategy that optimizes the initial noise of the generation process using a sharpness-aware regularization term.

- **[SSD-TS: Exploring the Potential of Linear State Space Models for Diffusion Models in Time Series Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13338)**  `arXiv:2410.13338`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Hongfan Gao, Wangmeng Shen, Xiangfei Qiu, Ronghui Xu, Jilin Hu, Bin Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Probabilistic time series imputation has been widely applied in real-world scenarios due to its ability for uncertainty estimation and denoising diffusion probabilistic models~(DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)\textit{The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the dependencies in the time series data effectively.} To address the first challenge, we explore the potential of state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denoising module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for time series data modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple real-world datasets.

- **[Revisiting Diffusion Q-Learning: From Iterative Denoising to One-Step Action Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13904)**  `arXiv:2508.13904`  `cs.LG`  
  _Thanh Nguyen, Chang D. Yoo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning (RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time compared to DQL.

- **[Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning with Sheaf Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13642)**  `arXiv:2508.13642`  `cs.LG`  
  _Wenfei Liang, Yanan Zhao, Rui She, Yiming Li, Wee Peng Tay_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph-structured data is prevalent in many applications. In subgraph federated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a local subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for each client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance variation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local subgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework built on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors with efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by leveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the collaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN generates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it exhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  How far are we really from automatically generating neural networks? While neural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle with generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To address this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates task-specific weights conditioned on natural language descriptions. T2W hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates text embeddings from CLIP via a prior attention mechanism, and employs adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to enhance generalization. Experiments on Cifar100, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet demonstrate T2W's ability to produce high-quality weights for unseen tasks, outperforming optimization-based initialization and enabling novel applications such as weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion. Our work bridges textual semantics with weight-space dynamics, supported by an open-source dataset of text-weight pairs, advancing the practicality of generative models in neural network parameter synthesis. Our code is available on Github.

- **[Fully Automated Segmentation of Fiber Bundles in Anatomic Tracing Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12942)**  `arXiv:2508.12942`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Kyriaki-Margarita Bintsi, Ya√´l Balbastre, Jingjing Wu, Julia F. Lehman, Suzanne N. Haber, Anastasia Yendiki_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anatomic tracer studies are critical for validating and improving diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography. However, large-scale analysis of data from such studies is hampered by the labor-intensive process of annotating fiber bundles manually on histological slides. Existing automated methods often miss sparse bundles or require complex post-processing across consecutive sections, limiting their flexibility and generalizability. We present a streamlined, fully automated framework for fiber bundle segmentation in macaque tracer data, based on a U-Net architecture with large patch sizes, foreground aware sampling, and semisupervised pre-training. Our approach eliminates common errors such as mislabeling terminals as bundles, improves detection of sparse bundles by over 20% and reduces the False Discovery Rate (FDR) by 40% compared to the state-of-the-art, all while enabling analysis of standalone slices. This new framework will facilitate the automated analysis of anatomic tracing data at a large scale, generating more ground-truth data that can be used to validate and optimize dMRI tractography methods.

- **[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Using Diffusion Trend Analysis for Display Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09578)**  `arXiv:2407.09578`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Eunwoo Kim, Un Yang, Cheol Lae Roh, Stefano Ermon_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstruction-based anomaly detection via denoising diffusion model has limitations in determining appropriate noise parameters that can degrade anomalies while preserving normal characteristics. Also, normal regions can fluctuate considerably during reconstruction, resulting in false detection. In this paper, we propose a method to detect anomalies by analysis of reconstruction trend depending on the degree of degradation, effectively solving the both problems that impede practical application in display inspection.

- **[Dataset Condensation with Color Compensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01139)**  `arXiv:2508.01139`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Huyu Wu, Duo Su, Junjie Hou, Guang Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other degradation issues. Code and generated data are available atthis https URL.

- **[GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300)**  `arXiv:2508.13300`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Sirshapan Mitra, Yogesh S. Rawat_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain. Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch, exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions. Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects. Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

  _Paul Grimal, Micha√´l Soumm, Herv√© Le Borgne, Olivier Ferret, Akihiro Sugimoto_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities -- such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The code is available atthis https URL.

- **[DiffIER: Optimizing Diffusion Models with Iterative Error Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13628)**  `arXiv:2508.13628`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ao Chen, Lihe Ding, Tianfan Xue_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap. Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks. Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation. The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain, snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based, and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62 percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

- **[Temporal-Conditional Referring Video Object Segmentation with Noise-Free Text-to-Video Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13584)**  `arXiv:2508.13584`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ruixin Zhang, Jiaqing Fan, Yifan Liao, Qian Qiao, Fanzhang Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore, our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement (TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  _Chenjian Gao, Lihe Ding, Xin Cai, Zhanpeng Huang, Zibin Wang, Tianfan Xue_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits. First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video (I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our key innovation is using a spatiotemporal mask to strategically guide the LoRA fine-tuning process. This teaches the model two distinct skills: first, to interpret the mask as a command to either preserve content from the source video or generate new content in designated regions. Second, for these generated regions, LoRA learns to synthesize either temporally consistent motion inherited from the video or novel appearances guided by user-provided reference frames. This dual-capability LoRA grants users control over the edit's entire temporal evolution, allowing complex transformations like an object rotating or a flower blooming. Experimental results show our method achieves superior video editing performance compared to baseline methods. Project Page:this https URL

- **[Geo4D: Leveraging Video Generators for Geometric 4D Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07961)**  `arXiv:2504.07961`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zeren Jiang, Chuanxia Zheng, Iro Laina, Diane Larlus, Andrea Vedaldi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Geo4D, a method to repurpose video diffusion models for monocular 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes. By leveraging the strong dynamic priors captured by large-scale pre-trained video models, Geo4D can be trained using only synthetic data while generalizing well to real data in a zero-shot manner. Geo4D predicts several complementary geometric modalities, namely point, disparity, and ray maps. We propose a new multi-modal alignment algorithm to align and fuse these modalities, as well as a sliding window approach at inference time, thus enabling robust and accurate 4D reconstruction of long videos. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Geo4D significantly surpasses state-of-the-art video depth estimation methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has achieved remarkable progress using only image-level labels. However, most existing WSSS methods focus on designing new network structures and loss functions to generate more accurate dense labels, overlooking the limitations imposed by fixed datasets, which can constrain performance improvements. We argue that more diverse trainable images provides WSSS richer information and help model understand more comprehensive semantic pattern. Therefore in this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Image Augmentation Agent (IAA) which shows that it is possible to enhance WSSS from data generation perspective. IAA mainly design an augmentation agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models to automatically generate additional images for WSSS. In practice, to address the instability in prompt generation by LLMs, we develop a prompt self-refinement mechanism. It allow LLMs to re-evaluate the rationality of generated prompts to produce more coherent prompts. Additionally, we insert an online filter into diffusion generation process to dynamically ensure the quality and balance of generated images. Experimental results show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art WSSS approaches on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.

  _Hieu T. Nguyen, Yiwen Chen, Vikram Voleti, Varun Jampani, Huaizu Jiang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce HouseCrafter, a novel approach that can lift a floorplan into a complete large 3D indoor scene (e.g., a house). Our key insight is to adapt a 2D diffusion model, which is trained on web-scale images, to generate consistent multi-view color (RGB) and depth (D) images across different locations of the scene. Specifically, the RGB-D images are generated autoregressively in a batch-wise manner along sampled locations based on the floorplan, where previously generated images are used as condition to the diffusion model to produce images at nearby locations. The global floorplan and attention design in the diffusion model ensures the consistency of the generated images, from which a 3D scene can be reconstructed. Through extensive evaluation on the 3D-Front dataset, we demonstrate that HouseCraft can generate high-quality house-scale 3D scenes. Ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of different design choices. We will release our code and model weights. Project page:this https URL

  _Yichi Zhang, Xiaogang Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative models now produce images with such stunning realism that they can easily deceive the human eye. While this progress unlocks vast creative potential, it also presents significant risks, such as the spread of misinformation. Consequently, detecting generated images has become a critical research challenge. However, current detection methods are often plagued by low accuracy and poor generalization. In this paper, to address these limitations and enhance the detection of generated images, we propose a novel representation, Diffusion Noise Feature (DNF). Derived from the inverse process of diffusion models, DNF effectively amplifies the subtle, high-frequency artifacts that act as fingerprints of artificial generation. Our key insight is that real and generated images exhibit distinct DNF signatures, providing a robust basis for differentiation. By training a simple classifier such as ResNet-50 on DNF, our approach achieves remarkable accuracy, robustness, and generalization in detecting generated images, including those from unseen generators or with novel content. Extensive experiments across four training datasets and five test sets confirm that DNF establishes a new state-of-the-art in generated image detection. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in masked diffusion models (MDMs) have established them as powerful non-autoregressive alternatives for sequence generation. Nevertheless, our preliminary experiments reveal that the generation quality of MDMs is still highly sensitive to the choice of decoding strategy. In particular, widely adopted uncertainty-based samplers suffer from two key limitations: a lack of global trajectory control and a pronounced bias toward trivial tokens in the early stages of decoding. These shortcomings restrict the full potential of MDMs. In this work, we introduce Position-Aware Confidence-Calibrated Sampling (PC-Sampler), a novel decoding strategy that unifies global trajectory planning with content-aware informativeness maximization. PC-Sampler incorporates a position-aware weighting mechanism to regulate the decoding path and a calibrated confidence score to suppress the premature selection of trivial tokens. Extensive experiments on three advanced MDMs across seven challenging benchmarks-including logical reasoning and planning tasks-demonstrate that PC-Sampler consistently outperforms existing MDM decoding strategies by more than 10% on average, significantly narrowing the performance gap with state-of-the-art autoregressive models.

- **[Towards Urban Planing AI Agent in the Age of Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14730)**  `arXiv:2507.14730`  `cs.AI`  
  _Yanjie Fu, Dongjie Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative AI, large language models, and agentic AI have emerged separately of urban planning. However, the convergence between AI and urban planning presents an interesting opportunity towards AI urban planners. Existing studies conceptualizes urban planning as a generative AI task, where AI synthesizes land-use configurations under geospatial, social, and human-centric constraints and reshape automated urban design. We further identify critical gaps of existing generative urban planning studies: 1) the generative structure has to be predefined with strong assumption: all of adversarial generator-discriminator, forward and inverse diffusion structures, hierarchical zone-POI generative structure are predefined by humans; 2) ignore the power of domain expert developed tools: domain urban planners have developed various tools in the urban planning process guided by urban theory, while existing pure neural networks based generation ignore the power of the tools developed by urban planner practitioners. To address these limitations, we outline a future research direction agentic urban AI planner, calling for a new synthesis of agentic AI and participatory urbanism.
