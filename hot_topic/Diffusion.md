- **[Balanced Image Stylization with Style Matching Score](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07601)**  `arXiv:2503.07601`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Yuxin Jiang, Liming Jiang, Shuai Yang, Jia-Wei Liu, Ivor Tsang, Mike Zheng Shou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Style Matching Score (SMS), a novel optimization method for image stylization with diffusion models. Balancing effective style transfer with content preservation is a long-standing challenge. Unlike existing efforts, our method reframes image stylization as a style distribution matching problem. The target style distribution is estimated from off-the-shelf style-dependent LoRAs via carefully designed score functions. To preserve content information adaptively, we propose Progressive Spectrum Regularization, which operates in the frequency domain to guide stylization progressively from low-frequency layouts to high-frequency details. In addition, we devise a Semantic-Aware Gradient Refinement technique that leverages relevance maps derived from diffusion semantic priors to selectively stylize semantically important regions. The proposed optimization formulation extends stylization from pixel space to parameter space, readily applicable to lightweight feedforward generators for efficient one-step stylization. SMS effectively balances style alignment and content preservation, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches, verified by extensive experiments.

- **[FlowEdit: Inversion-Free Text-Based Editing Using Pre-Trained Flow Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08629)**  `arXiv:2412.08629`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Editing real images using a pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion/flow model often involves inverting the image into its corresponding noise map. However, inversion by itself is typically insufficient for obtaining satisfactory results, and therefore many methods additionally intervene in the sampling process. Such methods achieve improved results but are not seamlessly transferable between model architectures. Here, we introduce FlowEdit, a text-based editing method for pre-trained T2I flow models, which is inversion-free, optimization-free and model agnostic. Our method constructs an ODE that directly maps between the source and target distributions (corresponding to the source and target text prompts) and achieves a lower transport cost than the inversion approach. This leads to state-of-the-art results, as we illustrate with Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX. Code and examples are available on the project's webpage.

- **[EarthCrafter: Scalable 3D Earth Generation via Dual-Sparse Latent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16535)**  `arXiv:2507.16535`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Shang Liu, Chenjie Cao, Chaohui Yu, Wen Qian, Jing Wang, Fan Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the remarkable developments achieved by recent 3D generation works, scaling these methods to geographic extents, such as modeling thousands of square kilometers of Earth's surface, remains an open challenge. We address this through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture. First, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date, consisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across the U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1) Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely large-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications, from semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain synthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data priors from Aerial-Earth3D.

- **[LSSGen: Leveraging Latent Space Scaling in Flow and Diffusion for Efficient Text to Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16154)**  `arXiv:2507.16154`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Jyun-Ze Tang, Chih-Fan Hsu, Jeng-Lin Li, Ming-Ching Chang, Wei-Chao Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flow matching and diffusion models have shown impressive results in text-to-image generation, producing photorealistic images through an iterative denoising process. A common strategy to speed up synthesis is to perform early denoising at lower resolutions. However, traditional methods that downscale and upscale in pixel space often introduce artifacts and distortions. These issues arise when the upscaled images are re-encoded into the latent space, leading to degraded final image quality. To address this, we propose {\bf Latent Space Scaling Generation (LSSGen)}, a framework that performs resolution scaling directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler. Without altering the Transformer or U-Net architecture, LSSGen improves both efficiency and visual quality while supporting flexible multi-resolution generation. Our comprehensive evaluation covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality shows that LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches. When generating $1024^2$ images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246\% TOPIQ score improvement.

- **[PRISM: High-Resolution & Precise Counterfactual Medical Image Generation using Language-guided Stable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00196)**  `arXiv:2503.00196`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Amar Kumar, Anita Kriz, Mohammad Havaei, Tal Arbel_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Developing reliable and generalizable deep learning systems for medical imaging faces significant obstacles due to spurious correlations, data imbalances, and limited text annotations in datasets. Addressing these challenges requires architectures that are robust to the unique complexities posed by medical imaging data. Rapid advancements in vision-language foundation models within the natural image domain prompt the question of how they can be adapted for medical imaging tasks. In this work, we present PRISM, a framework that leverages foundation models to generate high-resolution, language-guided medical image counterfactuals using Stable Diffusion. Our approach demonstrates unprecedented precision in selectively modifying spurious correlations (the medical devices) and disease features, enabling the removal and addition of specific attributes while preserving other image characteristics. Through extensive evaluation, we show how PRISM advances counterfactual generation and enables the development of more robust downstream classifiers for clinically deployable solutions. To facilitate broader adoption and research, we make our code publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[VitaGlyph: Vitalizing Artistic Typography with Flexible Dual-branch Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01738)**  `arXiv:2410.01738`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Kailai Feng, Yabo Zhang, Haodong Yu, Zhilong Ji, Jinfeng Bai, Hongzhi Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Artistic typography is a technique to visualize the meaning of input character in an imaginable and readable manner. With powerful text-to-image diffusion models, existing methods directly design the overall geometry and texture of input character, making it challenging to ensure both creativity and legibility. In this paper, we introduce a dual-branch, training-free method called VitaGlyph, enabling flexible artistic typography with controllable geometry changes while maintaining the readability. The key insight of VitaGlyph is to treat input character as a scene composed of a Subject and its Surrounding, which are rendered with varying degrees of geometric transformation. To enhance the visual appeal and creativity of the generated artistic typography, the subject flexibly expresses the essential concept of the input character, while the surrounding enriches relevant background without altering the shape, thus maintaining overall readability. Specifically, we implement VitaGlyph through a three-phase framework: (i) Knowledge Acquisition leverages large language models to design text descriptions for the subject and surrounding. (ii) Regional Interpretation detects the part that most closely matches the subject description and refines the structure via Semantic Typography. (iii) Attentional Compositional Generation separately renders the textures of the Subject and Surrounding regions and blends them in an attention-based manner. Experimental results demonstrate that VitaGlyph not only achieves better artistry and readability but also manages to depict multiple customized concepts, facilitating more creative and pleasing artistic typography generation. Our code will be made publicly available.

- **[FBSDiff: Plug-and-Play Frequency Band Substitution of Diffusion Features for Highly Controllable Text-Driven Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00998)**  `arXiv:2408.00998`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Xiang Gao, Jiaying Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have been a revolutionary milestone in the evolution of generative AI and multimodal technology, allowing wonderful image generation with natural-language text prompt. However, the issue of lacking controllability of such models restricts their practical applicability for real-life content creation. Thus, attention has been focused on leveraging a reference image to control text-to-image synthesis, which is also regarded as manipulating (or editing) a reference image as per a text prompt, namely, text-driven image-to-image translation. This paper contributes a novel, concise, and efficient approach that adapts pre-trained large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to the image-to-image (I2I) paradigm in a plug-and-play manner, realizing high-quality and versatile text-driven I2I translation without any model training, model fine-tuning, or online optimization process. To guide T2I generation with a reference image, we propose to decompose diverse guiding factors with different frequency bands of diffusion features in the DCT spectral space, and accordingly devise a novel frequency band substitution layer which realizes dynamic control of the reference image to the T2I generation result in a plug-and-play manner. We demonstrate that our method allows flexible control over both guiding factor and guiding intensity of the reference image simply by tuning the type and bandwidth of the substituted frequency band, respectively. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of our approach over related methods in I2I translation visual quality, versatility, and controllability.

- **[HarmonPaint: Harmonized Training-Free Diffusion Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16732)**  `arXiv:2507.16732`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ying Li, Xinzhe Li, Yong Du, Yangyang Xu, Junyu Dong, Shengfeng He_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing inpainting methods often require extensive retraining or fine-tuning to integrate new content seamlessly, yet they struggle to maintain coherence in both structure and style between inpainted regions and the surrounding background. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce HarmonPaint, a training-free inpainting framework that seamlessly integrates with the attention mechanisms of diffusion models to achieve high-quality, harmonized image inpainting without any form of training. By leveraging masking strategies within self-attention, HarmonPaint ensures structural fidelity without model retraining or fine-tuning. Additionally, we exploit intrinsic diffusion model properties to transfer style information from unmasked to masked regions, achieving a harmonious integration of styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HarmonPaint across diverse scenes and styles, validating its versatility and performance.

- **[Robust Noisy Pseudo-label Learning for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation Using Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16429)**  `arXiv:2507.16429`  `cs.CV`  
  _Lin Xi, Yingliang Ma, Cheng Wang, Sandra Howell, Aldo Rinaldi, Kawal S. Rhode_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Obtaining pixel-level annotations in the medical domain is both expensive and time-consuming, often requiring close collaboration between clinical experts and developers. Semi-supervised medical image segmentation aims to leverage limited annotated data alongside abundant unlabeled data to achieve accurate segmentation. However, existing semi-supervised methods often struggle to structure semantic distributions in the latent space due to noise introduced by pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our method introduces a constraint into the latent structure of semantic labels during the denoising diffusion process by enforcing prototype-based contrastive consistency. Rather than explicitly delineating semantic boundaries, the model leverages class prototypes centralized semantic representations in the latent space as anchors. This strategy improves the robustness of dense predictions, particularly in the presence of noisy pseudo-labels. We also introduce a new publicly available benchmark: Multi-Object Segmentation in X-ray Angiography Videos (MOSXAV), which provides detailed, manually annotated segmentation ground truth for multiple anatomical structures in X-ray angiography videos. Extensive experiments on the EndoScapes2023 and MOSXAV datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches under the semi-supervised learning setting. This work presents a robust and data-efficient diffusion model that offers enhanced flexibility and strong potential for a wide range of clinical applications.

- **[Sparse-View 3D Reconstruction: Recent Advances and Open Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16406)**  `arXiv:2507.16406`  `cs.CV`  
  _Tanveer Younis, Zhanglin Cheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is essential for applications in which dense image acquisition is impractical, such as robotics, augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), and autonomous systems. In these settings, minimal image overlap prevents reliable correspondence matching, causing traditional methods, such as structure-from-motion (SfM) and multiview stereo (MVS), to fail. This survey reviews the latest advances in neural implicit models (e.g., NeRF and its regularized versions), explicit point-cloud-based approaches (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting), and hybrid frameworks that leverage priors from diffusion and vision foundation models (VFMs).We analyze how geometric regularization, explicit shape modeling, and generative inference are used to mitigate artifacts such as floaters and pose ambiguities in sparse-view settings. Comparative results on standard benchmarks reveal key trade-offs between the reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Unlike previous reviews, our survey provides a unified perspective on geometry-based, neural implicit, and generative (diffusion-based) methods. We highlight the persistent challenges in domain generalization and pose-free reconstruction and outline future directions for developing 3D-native generative priors and achieving real-time, unconstrained sparse-view reconstruction.

- **[Navigating Large-Pose Challenge for High-Fidelity Face Reenactment with Video Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16341)**  `arXiv:2507.16341`  `cs.CV`  
  _Mingtao Guo, Guanyu Xing, Yanci Zhang, Yanli Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Face reenactment aims to generate realistic talking head videos by transferring motion from a driving video to a static source image while preserving the source identity. Although existing methods based on either implicit or explicit keypoints have shown promise, they struggle with large pose variations due to warping artifacts or the limitations of coarse facial landmarks. In this paper, we present the Face Reenactment Video Diffusion model (FRVD), a novel framework for high-fidelity face reenactment under large pose changes. Our method first employs a motion extractor to extract implicit facial keypoints from the source and driving images to represent fine-grained motion and to perform motion alignment through a warping module. To address the degradation introduced by warping, we introduce a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM) that maps the warped source image into the motion-aware latent space of a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model. This latent space encodes rich priors of facial dynamics learned from large-scale video data, enabling effective warping correction and enhancing temporal coherence. Extensive experiments show that FRVD achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of pose accuracy, identity preservation, and visual quality, especially in challenging scenarios with extreme pose variations.

- **[PUSA V1.0: Surpassing Wan-I2V with $500 Training Cost by Vectorized Timestep Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16116)**  `arXiv:2507.16116`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yaofang Liu, Yumeng Ren, Aitor Artola, Yuxuan Hu, Xiaodong Cun, Xiaotong Zhao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of video diffusion models has been hindered by fundamental limitations in temporal modeling, particularly the rigid synchronization of frame evolution imposed by conventional scalar timestep variables. While task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models have sought to address these challenges, they remain constrained by computational inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability. In this work, we present Pusa, a groundbreaking paradigm that leverages vectorized timestep adaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video diffusion framework. Besides, VTA is a non-destructive adaptation, which means it fully preserves the capabilities of the base model. By finetuning the SOTA Wan2.1-T2V-14B model with VTA, we achieve unprecedented efficiency -- surpassing the performance of Wan-I2V-14B with $\leq$ 1/200 of the training cost (\$500 vs. $\geq$ \$100,000) and $\leq$ 1/2500 of the dataset size (4K vs. $\geq$ 10M samples). Pusa not only sets a new standard for image-to-video (I2V) generation, achieving a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32\% (vs. 86.86\% of Wan-I2V-14B), but also unlocks many zero-shot multi-task capabilities such as start-end frames and video extension -- all without task-specific training. Meanwhile, Pusa can still perform text-to-video generation. Mechanistic analyses reveal that our approach preserves the foundation model's generative priors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding the combinatorial explosion inherent to vectorized timesteps. This work establishes a scalable, efficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis, democratizing high-fidelity video generation for research and industry alike.

- **[Improving Personalized Image Generation through Social Context Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16095)**  `arXiv:2507.16095`  `cs.CV`  
  _Parul Gupta, Abhinav Dhall, Thanh-Toan Do_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personalized image generation, where reference images of one or more subjects are used to generate their image according to a scene description, has gathered significant interest in the community. However, such generated images suffer from three major limitations -- complex activities, such as $<$man, pushing, motorcycle$>$ are not generated properly with incorrect human poses, reference human identities are not preserved, and generated human gaze patterns are unnatural/inconsistent with the scene description. In this work, we propose to overcome these shortcomings through feedback-based fine-tuning of existing personalized generation methods, wherein, state-of-art detectors of pose, human-object-interaction, human facial recognition and human gaze-point estimation are used to refine the diffusion model. We also propose timestep-based inculcation of different feedback modules, depending upon whether the signal is low-level (such as human pose), or high-level (such as gaze point). The images generated in this manner show an improvement in the generated interactions, facial identities and image quality over three benchmark datasets.

- **[PAT++: a cautionary tale about generative visual augmentation for Object Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15888)**  `arXiv:2507.15888`  `cs.CV`  
  _Leonardo Santiago Benitez Pereira, Arathy Jeevan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative data augmentation has demonstrated gains in several vision tasks, but its impact on object re-identification - where preserving fine-grained visual details is essential - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we assess the effectiveness of identity-preserving image generation for object re-identification. Our novel pipeline, named PAT++, incorporates Diffusion Self-Distillation into the well-established Part-Aware Transformer. Using the Urban Elements ReID Challenge dataset, we conduct extensive experiments with generated images used for both model training and query expansion. Our results show consistent performance degradation, driven by domain shifts and failure to retain identity-defining features. These findings challenge assumptions about the transferability of generative models to fine-grained recognition tasks and expose key limitations in current approaches to visual augmentation for identity-preserving applications.

- **[FiVE: A Fine-grained Video Editing Benchmark for Evaluating Emerging Diffusion and Rectified Flow Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13684)**  `arXiv:2503.13684`  `cs.CV`  
  _Minghan Li, Chenxi Xie, Yichen Wu, Lei Zhang, Mengyu Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Numerous text-to-video (T2V) editing methods have emerged recently, but the lack of a standardized benchmark for fair evaluation has led to inconsistent claims and an inability to assess model sensitivity to hyperparameters. Fine-grained video editing is crucial for enabling precise, object-level modifications while maintaining context and temporal consistency. To address this, we introduce FiVE, a Fine-grained Video Editing Benchmark for evaluating emerging diffusion and rectified flow models. Our benchmark includes 74 real-world videos and 26 generated videos, featuring 6 fine-grained editing types, 420 object-level editing prompt pairs, and their corresponding masks. Additionally, we adapt the latest rectified flow (RF) T2V generation models, Pyramid-Flow and Wan2.1, by introducing FlowEdit, resulting in training-free and inversion-free video editing models Pyramid-Edit and Wan-Edit. We evaluate five diffusion-based and two RF-based editing methods on our FiVE benchmark using 15 metrics, covering background preservation, text-video similarity, temporal consistency, video quality, and runtime. To further enhance object-level evaluation, we introduce FiVE-Acc, a novel metric leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to assess the success of fine-grained video editing. Experimental results demonstrate that RF-based editing significantly outperforms diffusion-based methods, with Wan-Edit achieving the best overall performance and exhibiting the least sensitivity to hyperparameters.

- **[USP: Unified Self-Supervised Pretraining for Image Generation and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06132)**  `arXiv:2503.06132`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xiangxiang Chu, Renda Li, Yong Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies have highlighted the interplay between diffusion models and representation learning. Intermediate representations from diffusion models can be leveraged for downstream visual tasks, while self-supervised vision models can enhance the convergence and generation quality of diffusion models. However, transferring pretrained weights from vision models to diffusion models is challenging due to input mismatches and the use of latent spaces. To address these challenges, we propose Unified Self-supervised Pretraining (USP), a framework that initializes diffusion models via masked latent modeling in a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) latent space. USP achieves comparable performance in understanding tasks while significantly improving the convergence speed and generation quality of diffusion models. Our code will be publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[One-for-More: Continual Diffusion Model for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19848)**  `arXiv:2502.19848`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xiaofan Li, Xin Tan, Zhuo Chen, Zhizhong Zhang, Ruixin Zhang, Rizen Guo, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rise of generative models, there is a growing interest in unifying all tasks within a generative framework. Anomaly detection methods also fall into this scope and utilize diffusion models to generate or reconstruct normal samples when given arbitrary anomaly images. However, our study found that the diffusion model suffers from severe ``faithfulness hallucination'' and ``catastrophic forgetting'', which can't meet the unpredictable pattern increments. To mitigate the above problems, we propose a continual diffusion model that uses gradient projection to achieve stable continual learning. Gradient projection deploys a regularization on the model updating by modifying the gradient towards the direction protecting the learned knowledge. But as a double-edged sword, it also requires huge memory costs brought by the Markov process. Hence, we propose an iterative singular value decomposition method based on the transitive property of linear representation, which consumes tiny memory and incurs almost no performance loss. Finally, considering the risk of ``over-fitting'' to normal images of the diffusion model, we propose an anomaly-masked network to enhance the condition mechanism of the diffusion model. For continual anomaly detection, ours achieves first place in 17/18 settings on MVTec and VisA. Code is available atthis https URL

- **[GraspDiffusion: Synthesizing Realistic Whole-body Hand-Object Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13911)**  `arXiv:2410.13911`  `cs.CV`  
  _Patrick Kwon, Chen Chen, Hanbyul Joo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent generative models can synthesize high-quality images but often fail to generate humans interacting with objects using their hands. This arises mostly from the model's misunderstanding of such interactions, and the hardships of synthesizing intricate regions of the body. In this paper, we propose GraspDiffusion, a novel generative method that creates realistic scenes of human-object interaction. Given a 3D object mesh, GraspDiffusion first constructs life-like whole-body poses with control over the object's location relative to the human body. This is achieved by separately leveraging the generative priors for 3D body and hand poses, optimizing them into a joint grasping pose. The resulting pose guides the image synthesis to correctly reflect the intended interaction, allowing the creation of realistic and diverse human-object interaction scenes. We demonstrate that GraspDiffusion can successfully tackle the relatively uninvestigated problem of generating full-bodied human-object interactions while outperforming previous methods.

  _Qing Lin, Jingfeng Zhang, Yew-Soon Ong, Mengmi Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the rapid progress in image generation, emotional image editing remains under-explored. The semantics, context, and structure of an image can evoke emotional responses, making emotional image editing techniques valuable for various real-world applications, including treatment of psychological disorders, commercialization of products, and artistic design. First, we present a novel challenge of emotion-evoked image generation, aiming to synthesize images that evoke target emotions while retaining the semantics and structures of the original scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a diffusion model capable of effectively understanding and editing source images to convey desired emotions and sentiments. Moreover, due to the lack of emotion editing datasets, we provide a unique dataset consisting of 340,000 pairs of images and their emotion annotations. Furthermore, we conduct human psychophysics experiments and introduce a new evaluation metric to systematically benchmark all the methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses all competitive baselines. Our diffusion model is capable of identifying emotional cues from original images, editing images that elicit desired emotions, and meanwhile, preserving the semantic structure of the original images. All code, model, and dataset are available at GitHub.

- **[Multimodal Forecasting of Sparse Intraoperative Hypotension Events Powered by Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22116)**  `arXiv:2505.22116`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Jintao Zhang, Zirui Liu, Mingyue Cheng, Shilong Zhang, Tingyue Pan, Yitong zhou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) frequently occurs under general anesthesia and is strongly linked to adverse outcomes such as myocardial injury and increased mortality. Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability in clinical decision support scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep research agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are rapidly advancing; yet, their performance often plateaus when generating complex, long-form research reports using generic test-time scaling algorithms. Drawing inspiration from the iterative nature of human research, which involves cycles of searching, reasoning, and revision, we propose the Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher (TTD-DR). This novel framework conceptualizes research report generation as a diffusion process. TTD-DR initiates this process with a preliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation to guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through a "denoising" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism that incorporates external information at each step. The core process is further enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of the agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the diffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process more timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative search process. We demonstrate that our TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide array of benchmarks that require intensive search and multi-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents.
