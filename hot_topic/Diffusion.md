- **[Adapting by Analogy: OOD Generalization of Visuomotor Policies via Functional Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12678)**  `arXiv:2506.12678`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  End-to-end visuomotor policies trained using behavior cloning have shown a remarkable ability to generate complex, multi-modal low-level robot behaviors. However, at deployment time, these policies still struggle to act reliably when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) visuals induced by objects, backgrounds, or environment changes. Prior works in interactive imitation learning solicit corrective expert demonstrations under the OOD conditions -- but this can be costly and inefficient. We observe that task success under OOD conditions does not always warrant novel robot behaviors. In-distribution (ID) behaviors can directly be transferred to OOD conditions that share functional similarities with ID conditions. For example, behaviors trained to interact with in-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with a visually-OOD pencil. The key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally correspond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an expert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of collecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our method: (1) detects the need for feedback by first checking if current observations are OOD and then identifying whether the most similar training observations show divergent behaviors, (2) solicits functional correspondence feedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD observations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform deployment-time generalization. We validate our method across diverse real-world robotic manipulation tasks with a Franka Panda robotic manipulator. Our results show that test-time functional correspondences can improve the generalization of a vision-based diffusion policy to OOD objects and environment conditions with low feedback.

  Solving Inverse Kinematics (IK) problems is fundamental to robotics, but has primarily been successful with single serial manipulators. For multi-arm robotic systems, IK remains challenging due to complex self-collisions, coupled joints, and high-dimensional redundancy. These complexities make traditional IK solvers slow, prone to failure, and lacking in solution diversity. In this paper, we present IKDiffuser, a diffusion-based model designed for fast and diverse IK solution generation for multi-arm robotic systems. IKDiffuser learns the joint distribution over the configuration space, capturing complex dependencies and enabling seamless generalization to multi-arm robotic systems of different structures. In addition, IKDiffuser can incorporate additional objectives during inference without retraining, offering versatility and adaptability for task-specific requirements. In experiments on 6 different multi-arm systems, the proposed IKDiffuser achieves superior solution accuracy, precision, diversity, and computational efficiency compared to existing solvers. The proposed IKDiffuser framework offers a scalable, unified approach to solving multi-arm IK problems, facilitating the potential of multi-arm robotic systems in real-time manipulation tasks.

  Robotic odour source localization (OSL) is a critical capability for autonomous systems operating in complex environments. However, current OSL methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines with vision-language models (VLMs) This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and the training data of VLMs, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors which emulate human olfactory recognition through electronic sensor arrays. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to the challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.

  Human videos offer a scalable way to train robot manipulation policies, but lack the action labels needed by standard imitation learning algorithms. Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes.

- **[VLM-SFD: VLM-Assisted Siamese Flow Diffusion Framework for Dual-Arm Cooperative Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13428)**  `arXiv:2506.13428`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dual-arm cooperative manipulation holds great promise for tackling complex real-world tasks that demand seamless coordination and adaptive dynamics. Despite substantial progress in learning-based motion planning, most approaches struggle to generalize across diverse manipulation tasks and adapt to dynamic, unstructured environments, particularly in scenarios involving interactions between two objects such as assembly, tool use, and bimanual grasping. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel VLM-Assisted Siamese Flow Diffusion (VLM-SFD) framework for efficient imitation learning in dual-arm cooperative manipulation. The proposed VLM-SFD framework exhibits outstanding adaptability, significantly enhancing the ability to rapidly adapt and generalize to diverse real-world tasks from only a minimal number of human demonstrations. Specifically, we propose a Siamese Flow Diffusion Network (SFDNet) employs a dual-encoder-decoder Siamese architecture to embed two target objects into a shared latent space, while a diffusion-based conditioning process-conditioned by task instructions-generates two-stream object-centric motion flows that guide dual-arm coordination. We further design a dynamic task assignment strategy that seamlessly maps the predicted 2D motion flows into 3D space and incorporates a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to adaptively assign the optimal motion to each robotic arm over time. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its ability to generalize to diverse manipulation tasks while maintaining high efficiency and adaptability. The code and demo videos are publicly available on our project websitethis https URL.

  The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled modern AI systems to comprehend and produce highly sophisticated content, even achieving human-level performance in specific domains. However, these models remain fundamentally constrained by catastrophic forgetting - a persistent challenge where adapting to new tasks typically leads to significant degradation in performance on previously learned tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative models in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative models, including large language models, multimodal large language models, vision language action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, offering deeper insights into the field.

  The comparison between discriminative and generative classifiers has intrigued researchers since Efron's seminal analysis of logistic regression versus discriminant analysis. While early theoretical work established that generative classifiers exhibit lower sample complexity but higher asymptotic error in simple linear settings, these trade-offs remain unexplored in the transformer era. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of modern generative and discriminative architectures - Auto-regressive modeling, Masked Language Modeling, Discrete Diffusion, and Encoders for text classification. Our study reveals that the classical 'two regimes' phenomenon manifests distinctly across different architectures and training paradigms. Beyond accuracy, we analyze sample efficiency, calibration, noise robustness, and ordinality across diverse scenarios. Our findings offer practical guidance for selecting the most suitable modeling approach based on real-world constraints such as latency and data limitations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a unified framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using video-inpainting diffusion transformer models. Unlike existing methods that devise specialized strategies for either forward or inverse problems under full or partial observation, our approach unifies these tasks under a single, flexible generative framework. Specifically, we recast PDE-solving as a generalized inpainting problem, e.g., treating forward prediction as inferring missing spatiotemporal information of future states from initial conditions. To this end, we design a transformer-based architecture that conditions on arbitrary patterns of known data to infer missing values across time and space. Our method proposes pixel-space video diffusion models for fine-grained, high-fidelity inpainting and conditioning, while enhancing computational efficiency through hierarchical modeling. Extensive experiments show that our video inpainting-based diffusion model offers an accurate and versatile solution across a wide range of PDEs and problem setups, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

- **[Flexible-length Text Infilling for Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13579)**  `arXiv:2506.13579`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discrete diffusion models are a new class of text generators that offer advantages such as bidirectional context use, parallelizable generation, and flexible prompting compared to autoregressive models. However, a critical limitation of discrete diffusion models is their inability to perform flexible-length or flexible-position text infilling without access to ground-truth positional data. We introduce \textbf{DDOT} (\textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport Position Coupling), the first discrete diffusion model to overcome this challenge. DDOT jointly denoises token values and token positions, employing a novel sample-level Optimal Transport (OT) coupling. This coupling preserves relative token ordering while dynamically adjusting the positions and length of infilled segments, a capability previously missing in text diffusion. Our method is orthogonal to existing discrete text diffusion methods and is compatible with various pretrained text denoisers. Extensive experiments on text infilling benchmarks such as One-Billion-Word and Yelp demonstrate that DDOT outperforms naive diffusion baselines. Furthermore, DDOT achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models and enables significant improvements in training efficiency and flexibility.

  _Runpeng Yu, Qi Li, Xinchao Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs). Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x acceleration in inference speed.The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and dMLLMs research in early 2025.In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment.Paper collection:this https URL

- **[Seismic Acoustic Impedance Inversion Framework Based on Conditional Latent Generative Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13529)**  `arXiv:2506.13529`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Seismic acoustic impedance plays a crucial role in lithological identification and subsurface structure interpretation. However, due to the inherently ill-posed nature of the inversion problem, directly estimating impedance from post-stack seismic data remains highly challenging. Recently, diffusion models have shown great potential in addressing such inverse problems due to their strong prior learning and generative capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing methods operate in the pixel domain and require multiple iterations, limiting their applicability to field data. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel seismic acoustic impedance inversion framework based on a conditional latent generative diffusion model, where the inversion process is made in latent space. To avoid introducing additional training overhead when embedding conditional inputs, we design a lightweight wavelet-based module into the framework to project seismic data and reuse an encoder trained on impedance to embed low-frequency impedance into the latent space. Furthermore, we propose a model-driven sampling strategy during the inversion process of this framework to enhance accuracy and reduce the number of required diffusion steps. Numerical experiments on a synthetic model demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high inversion accuracy and strong generalization capability within only a few diffusion steps. Moreover, application to field data reveals enhanced geological detail and higher consistency with well-log measurements, validating the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach.

- **[Overcoming Overfitting in Reinforcement Learning via Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13111)**  `arXiv:2506.13111`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Amornyos Horprasert, Esa Apriaskar, Xingyu Liu, Lanlan Su, Lyudmila S. Mihaylova_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  One of the key challenges that Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces is its limited capability to adapt to a change of data distribution caused by uncertainties. This challenge arises especially in RL systems using deep neural networks as decision makers or policies, which are prone to overfitting after prolonged training on fixed environments. To address this challenge, this paper proposes Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy (GPDP), a new algorithm that integrates diffusion models and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to represent the policy. GPR guides diffusion models to generate actions that maximize learned Q-function, resembling the policy improvement in RL. Furthermore, the kernel-based nature of GPR enhances the policy's exploration efficiency under distribution shifts at test time, increasing the chance of discovering new behaviors and mitigating overfitting. Simulation results on the Walker2d benchmark show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms under distribution shift condition by achieving around 67.74% to 123.18% improvement in the RL's objective function while maintaining comparable performance under normal conditions.

- **[A Minimalist Method for Fine-tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12036)**  `arXiv:2506.12036`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image diffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However, existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present. These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion models.

- **[Entropic Time Schedulers for Generative Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13612)**  `arXiv:2504.13612`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Dejan Stancevic, Florian Handke, Luca Ambrogioni_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater improvements in the few NFEs regime.

  Diffusion-based Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has demonstrated effectiveness in solving NP-complete (NPC) problems by learning discrete diffusion models for solution generation, eliminating hand-crafted domain knowledge. Despite their success, existing NCO methods face significant challenges in both cross-scale and cross-problem generalization, and high training costs compared to traditional solvers. While recent studies on diffusion models have introduced training-free guidance approaches that leverage pre-defined guidance functions for conditional generation, such methodologies have not been extensively explored in combinatorial optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free inference time adaptation framework (DIFU-Ada) that enables both the zero-shot cross-problem transfer and cross-scale generalization capabilities of diffusion-based NCO solvers without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical analysis that helps understanding the cross-problem transfer capability. Our experimental results demonstrate that a diffusion solver, trained exclusively on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), can achieve competitive zero-shot transfer performance across different problem scales on TSP variants, such as Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP) and the Orienteering Problem (OP), through inference time adaptation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in molecular generative models have demonstrated great promise for accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often struggle to generate high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to improve molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions with provable theoretical guarantees. We decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared with single-stage generation, the easy-to-generate representation in the first stage guides the second stage generation toward a high-quality molecule in a goal-oriented way. Leveraging EDM and SemlaFlow as base generators, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation on the widely used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 50\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations. Furthermore, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while largely preserving the generation quality achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly reducing the generation iterations needed.

- **[Wireless Channel Identification via Conditional Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12419)**  `arXiv:2506.12419`  `cs.LG`  
  _Yuan Li, Zhong Zheng, Chang Liu, Zesong Fei_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The identification of channel scenarios in wireless systems plays a crucial role in channel modeling, radio fingerprint positioning, and transceiver design. Traditional methods to classify channel scenarios are based on typical statistical characteristics of channels, such as K-factor, path loss, delay spread, etc. However, statistic-based channel identification methods cannot accurately differentiate implicit features induced by dynamic scatterers, thus performing very poorly in identifying similar channel scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel channel scenario identification method, formulating the identification task as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Furthermore, the MAP estimation is reformulated by a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which is then approximated and solved by the conditional generative diffusion model. Specifically, we leverage a transformer network to capture hidden channel features in multiple latent noise spaces within the reverse process of the conditional generative diffusion model. These detailed features, which directly affect likelihood functions in MLE, enable highly accurate scenario identification. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs), and random forest-based classifiers, improving the identification accuracy by more than 10%.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine learning systems struggle with robustness, under subpopulation shifts. This problem becomes especially pronounced in scenarios where only a subset of attribute combinations is observed during training -a severe form of subpopulation shift, referred as compositional shift. To address this problem, we ask the following question: Can we improve the robustness by training on synthetic data, spanning all possible attribute combinations? We first show that training of conditional diffusion models on limited data lead to incorrect underlying distribution. Therefore, synthetic data sampled from such models will result in unfaithful samples and does not lead to improve performance of downstream machine learning systems. To address this problem, we propose CoInD to reflect the compositional nature of the world by enforcing conditional independence through minimizing Fisher's divergence between joint and marginal distributions. We demonstrate that synthetic data generated by CoInD is faithful and this translates to state-of-the-art worst-group accuracy on compositional shift tasks on CelebA.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  World models represent a promising approach for training reinforcement learning agents with significantly improved sample efficiency. While most world model methods primarily rely on sequences of discrete latent variables to model environment dynamics, this compression often neglects critical visual details essential for reinforcement learning. Recent diffusion-based world models condition generation on a fixed context length of frames to predict the next observation, using separate recurrent neural networks to model rewards and termination signals. Although this architecture effectively enhances visual fidelity, the fixed context length approach inherently limits memory capacity. In this paper, we introduce EDELINE, a unified world model architecture that integrates state space models with diffusion models. Our approach outperforms existing baselines across visually challenging Atari 100k tasks, memory-demanding Crafter benchmark, and 3D first-person ViZDoom environments, demonstrating superior performance in all these diverse challenges.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph generative models are essential across diverse scientific domains by capturing complex distributions over relational data. Among them, graph diffusion models achieve superior performance but face inefficient sampling and limited flexibility due to the tight coupling between training and sampling stages. We introduce DeFoG, a novel graph generative framework that disentangles sampling from training, enabling a broader design space for more effective and efficient model optimization. DeFoG employs a discrete flow-matching formulation that respects the inherent symmetries of graphs. We theoretically ground this disentangled formulation by explicitly relating the training loss to the sampling algorithm and showing that DeFoG faithfully replicates the ground truth graph distribution. Building on these foundations, we thoroughly investigate DeFoG's design space and propose novel sampling methods that significantly enhance performance and reduce the required number of refinement steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across synthetic, molecular, and digital pathology datasets, covering both unconditional and conditional generation settings. It also outperforms most diffusion-based models with just 5-10% of their sampling steps.

- **[Performance Plateaus in Inference-Time Scaling for Text-to-Image Diffusion Without External Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12633)**  `arXiv:2506.12633`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Changhyun Choi, Sungha Kim, H. Jin Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, it has been shown that investing computing resources in searching for good initial noise for a text-to-image diffusion model helps improve performance. However, previous studies required external models to evaluate the resulting images, which is impossible on GPUs with small VRAM. For these reasons, we apply Best-of-N inference-time scaling to algorithms that optimize the initial noise of a diffusion model without external models across multiple datasets and backbones. We demonstrate that inference-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models in this setting quickly reaches a performance plateau, and a relatively small number of optimization steps suffices to achieve the maximum achievable performance with each algorithm.

  Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress on image-to-video (I2V) generation, while their noise-to-data generation process is inherently mismatched with this task, which may lead to suboptimal synthesis quality. In this work, we present FrameBridge. By modeling the frame-to-frames generation process with a bridge model based data-to-data generative process, we are able to fully exploit the information contained in the given image and improve the consistency between the generation process and I2V task. Moreover, we propose two novel techniques toward the two popular settings of training I2V models, respectively. Firstly, we propose SNR-Aligned Fine-tuning (SAF), making the first attempt to fine-tune a diffusion model to a bridge model and, therefore, allowing us to utilize the pre-trained diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) models. Secondly, we propose neural prior, further improving the synthesis quality of FrameBridge when training from scratch. Experiments conducted on WebVid-2M and UCF-101 demonstrate the superior quality of FrameBridge in comparison with the diffusion counterpart (zero-shot FVD 95 vs. 192 on MSR-VTT and non-zero-shot FVD 122 vs. 171 on UCF-101), and the advantages of our proposed SAF and neural prior for bridge-based I2V models.

  This work investigates the adaptation of large pre-trained latent diffusion models to a radically new imaging domain: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). While these generative models, originally trained on natural images, demonstrate impressive capabilities in text-to-image synthesis, they are not natively adapted to represent SAR data, which involves different physics, statistical distributions, and visual characteristics. Using a sizeable SAR dataset (on the order of 100,000 to 1 million images), we address the fundamental question of fine-tuning such models for this unseen modality. We explore and compare multiple fine-tuning strategies, including full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient approaches like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), focusing separately on the UNet diffusion backbone and the text encoder components. To evaluate generative quality, we combine several metrics: statistical distance from real SAR distributions, textural similarity via GLCM descriptors, and semantic alignment assessed with a CLIP model fine-tuned on SAR data. Our results show that a hybrid tuning strategy yields the best performance: full fine-tuning of the UNet is better at capturing low-level SAR-specific patterns, while LoRA-based partial tuning of the text encoder, combined with embedding learning of the <SAR> token, suffices to preserve prompt alignment. This work provides a methodical strategy for adapting foundation models to unconventional imaging modalities beyond natural image domains.

  Recent advancements in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled the generation of high-quality and photorealistic images from text descriptions. However, they often exhibit societal biases related to gender, race, and socioeconomic status, thereby reinforcing harmful stereotypes and shaping public perception in unintended ways. While existing bias mitigation methods demonstrate effectiveness, they often encounter attribute entanglement, where adjustments to attributes relevant to the bias (i.e., target attributes) unintentionally alter attributes unassociated with the bias (i.e., non-target attributes), causing undesirable distribution shifts. To address this challenge, we introduce Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA), a method that accurately incorporates target attributes (e.g., White, Black, Asian, and Indian) while preserving non-target attributes (e.g., background details) during bias mitigation. At inference time, EFA randomly samples a target attribute with equal probability and adjusts the cross-attention in selected layers to incorporate the sampled attribute, achieving a fair distribution of target attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFA outperforms existing methods in mitigating bias while preserving non-target attributes, thereby maintaining the output distribution and generation capability of the original model.

  Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have achieved impressive success in visual generation. While, they suffer from slow inference speed due to iterative sampling. Employing fewer sampling steps is an intuitive solution, but this will also introduces discretization error. Existing fast samplers make inspiring efforts to reduce discretization error through the adoption of high-order solvers, potentially reaching a plateau in terms of optimization. This raises the question: can the sampling process be accelerated further? In this paper, we re-examine the nature of sampling errors, discerning that they comprise two distinct elements: the widely recognized discretization error and the less explored approximation error. Our research elucidates the dynamics between these errors and the step by implementing a dual-error disentanglement strategy. Building on these foundations, we introduce an unified and training-free acceleration framework, DualFast, designed to enhance the speed of DPM sampling by concurrently accounting for both error types, thereby minimizing the total sampling error. DualFast is seamlessly compatible with existing samplers and significantly boost their sampling quality and speed, particularly in extremely few sampling steps. We substantiate the effectiveness of our framework through comprehensive experiments, spanning both unconditional and conditional sampling domains, across both pixel-space and latent-space DPMs.

  Existing segmentation models trained on a single medical imaging dataset often lack robustness when encountering unseen organs or tumors. Developing a robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features. It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts, enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Surgeons exhibit distinct operating styles shaped by training, experience, and motor behavior-yet most surgical AI systems overlook this personalization signal. We propose a novel agentic modeling approach for surgeon-specific behavior prediction in robotic surgery, combining a discrete diffusion framework with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Gesture prediction is framed as a structured sequence denoising task, conditioned on multimodal inputs including surgical video, intent language, and personalized embeddings of surgeon identity and skill. These embeddings are encoded through natural language prompts using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon. To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage. These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical modeling.

  Diffusion models suffer severe object repetition and local distortion when the inference resolution differs from its pre-trained resolution. We propose AccDiffusion v2, an accurate method for patch-wise higher-resolution diffusion extrapolation without training. Our in-depth analysis in this paper shows that using an identical text prompt for different patches leads to repetitive generation, while the absence of a prompt undermines image details. In response, our AccDiffusion v2 novelly decouples the vanilla image-content-aware prompt into a set of patch-content-aware prompts, each of which serves as a more precise description of a patch. Further analysis reveals that local distortion arises from inaccurate descriptions in prompts about the local structure of higher-resolution images. To address this issue, AccDiffusion v2, for the first time, introduces an auxiliary local structural information through ControlNet during higher-resolution diffusion extrapolation aiming to mitigate the local distortions. Finally, our analysis indicates that global semantic information is conducive to suppressing both repetitive generation and local distortion. Hence, our AccDiffusion v2 further proposes dilated sampling with window interaction for better global semantic information during higher-resolution diffusion extrapolation. We conduct extensive experiments, including both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, to demonstrate the efficacy of our AccDiffusion v2. The quantitative comparison shows that AccDiffusion v2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in image generation extrapolation without training. The qualitative comparison intuitively illustrates that AccDiffusion v2 effectively suppresses the issues of repetitive generation and local distortion in image generation extrapolation.

  Blind image quality assessment (IQA) in the wild, which assesses the quality of images with complex authentic distortions and no reference images, presents significant challenges. Given the difficulty in collecting large-scale training data, leveraging limited data to develop a model with strong generalization remains an open problem. Motivated by the robust image perception capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, we propose a novel IQA method, diffusion priors-based IQA (DP-IQA), to utilize the T2I model's prior for improved performance and generalization ability. Specifically, we utilize pre-trained Stable Diffusion as the backbone, extracting multi-level features from the denoising U-Net guided by prompt embeddings through a tunable text adapter. Simultaneously, an image adapter compensates for information loss introduced by the lossy pre-trained encoder. Unlike T2I models that require full image distribution modeling, our approach targets image quality assessment, which inherently requires fewer parameters. To improve applicability, we distill the knowledge into a lightweight CNN-based student model, significantly reducing parameters while maintaining or even enhancing generalization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that DP-IQA achieves state-of-the-art performance on various in-the-wild datasets, highlighting the superior generalization capability of T2I priors in blind IQA tasks. To our knowledge, DP-IQA is the first method to apply pre-trained diffusion priors in blind IQA. Codes and checkpoints are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Distilling pre-trained 2D diffusion models into 3D assets has driven remarkable advances in text-to-3D synthesis. However, existing methods typically rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss, which involves asymmetric KL divergence--a formulation that inherently favors mode-seeking behavior and limits generation diversity. In this paper, we introduce Dive3D, a novel text-to-3D generation framework that replaces KL-based objectives with Score Implicit Matching (SIM) loss, a score-based objective that effectively mitigates mode collapse. Furthermore, Dive3D integrates both diffusion distillation and reward-guided optimization under a unified divergence perspective. Such reformulation, together with SIM loss, yields significantly more diverse 3D outputs while improving text alignment, human preference, and overall visual fidelity. We validate Dive3D across various 2D-to-3D prompts and find that it consistently outperforms prior methods in qualitative assessments, including diversity, photorealism, and aesthetic appeal. We further evaluate its performance on the GPTEval3D benchmark, comparing against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Dive3D also achieves strong results on quantitative metrics, including text-asset alignment, 3D plausibility, text-geometry consistency, texture quality, and geometric detail.

  Diffusion models are advancing autonomous driving by enabling realistic data synthesis, predictive end-to-end planning, and closed-loop simulation, with a primary focus on temporally consistent generation. However, the generation of large-scale 3D scenes that require spatial coherence remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose X-Scene, a novel framework for large-scale driving scene generation that achieves both geometric intricacy and appearance fidelity, while offering flexible controllability. Specifically, X-Scene supports multi-granular control, including low-level conditions such as user-provided or text-driven layout for detailed scene composition and high-level semantic guidance such as user-intent and LLM-enriched text prompts for efficient customization. To enhance geometrical and visual fidelity, we introduce a unified pipeline that sequentially generates 3D semantic occupancy and the corresponding multiview images, while ensuring alignment between modalities. Additionally, we extend the generated local region into a large-scale scene through consistency-aware scene outpainting, which extrapolates new occupancy and images conditioned on the previously generated area, enhancing spatial continuity and preserving visual coherence. The resulting scenes are lifted into high-quality 3DGS representations, supporting diverse applications such as scene exploration. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that X-Scene significantly advances controllability and fidelity for large-scale driving scene generation, empowering data generation and simulation for autonomous driving.

  Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in clinical radiotherapy for image-guided treatment, improving setup accuracy, adaptive planning, and motion management. However, slow gantry rotation limits performance by introducing motion artifacts, blurring, and increased dose. This work aims to develop a clinically feasible method for reconstructing high-quality CBCT volumes from consecutive limited-angle acquisitions, addressing imaging challenges in time- or dose-constrained settings. We propose a limited-angle (LA) geometry-integrated cycle-domain (LA-GICD) framework for CBCT reconstruction, comprising two denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) connected via analytic cone-beam forward and back projectors. A Projection-DDPM completes missing projections, followed by back-projection, and an Image-DDPM refines the volume. This dual-domain design leverages complementary priors from projection and image spaces to achieve high-quality reconstructions from limited-angle (<= 90 degrees) scans. Performance was evaluated against full-angle reconstruction. Four board-certified medical physicists conducted assessments. A total of 78 planning CTs in common CBCT geometries were used for training and evaluation. The method achieved a mean absolute error of 35.5 HU, SSIM of 0.84, and PSNR of 29.8 dB, with visibly reduced artifacts and improved soft-tissue clarity. LA-GICD's geometry-aware dual-domain learning, embedded in analytic forward/backward operators, enabled artifact-free, high-contrast reconstructions from a single 90-degree scan, reducing acquisition time and dose four-fold. LA-GICD improves limited-angle CBCT reconstruction with strong data fidelity and anatomical realism. It offers a practical solution for short-arc acquisitions, enhancing CBCT use in radiotherapy by providing clinically applicable images with reduced scan time and dose for more accurate, personalized treatments.

  Plane Geometry Diagram Synthesis has been a crucial task in computer graphics, with applications ranging from educational tools to AI-driven mathematical reasoning. Traditionally, we rely on computer tools (e.g., Matplotlib and GeoGebra) to manually generate precise diagrams, but it usually requires huge, complicated calculations cost. Recently, researchers start to work on learning-based methods (e.g., Stable Diffusion and GPT4) to automatically generate diagrams, saving operational cost but usually suffering from limited realism and insufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel framework GeoSDF to automatically generate diagrams efficiently and accurately with Signed Distance Field (SDF). Specifically, we first represent geometric elements in the SDF, then construct a series of constraint functions to represent geometric relationships, next we optimize such constraint functions to get an optimized field of both elements and constraints, finally by rendering the optimized field, we can obtain the synthesized diagram. In our GeoSDF, we define a symbolic language to easily represent geometric elements and those constraints, and our synthesized geometry diagrams can be self-verified in the SDF, ensuring both mathematical accuracy and visual plausibility. In experiments, our GeoSDF synthesized both normal high-school level and IMO-level geometry diagrams. Through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, we can see that synthesized diagrams are realistic and accurate, and our synthesizing process is simple and efficient. Furthermore, we obtain a very high accuracy of solving geometry problems (over 95\% while the current SOTA accuracy is around 75%) by leveraging our self-verification property. All of these demonstrate the advantage of GeoSDF, paving the way for more sophisticated, accurate, and flexible generation of geometric diagrams for a wide array of applications.

  Traditional point-based image editing methods rely on iterative latent optimization or geometric transformations, which are either inefficient in their processing or fail to capture the semantic relationships within the image. These methods often overlook the powerful yet underutilized image editing capabilities inherent in pre-trained diffusion models. In this work, we propose a novel one-step point-based image editing method, named AttentionDrag, which leverages the inherent latent knowledge and feature correlations within pre-trained diffusion models for image editing tasks. This framework enables semantic consistency and high-quality manipulation without the need for extensive re-optimization or retraining. Specifically, we reutilize the latent correlations knowledge learned by the self-attention mechanism in the U-Net module during the DDIM inversion process to automatically identify and adjust relevant image regions, ensuring semantic validity and consistency. Additionally, AttentionDrag adaptively generates masks to guide the editing process, enabling precise and context-aware modifications with friendly interaction. Our results demonstrate a performance that surpasses most state-of-the-art methods with significantly faster speeds, showing a more efficient and semantically coherent solution for point-based image editing tasks.

  Sign language transition generation seeks to convert discrete sign language segments into continuous sign videos by synthesizing smooth transitions. However,most existing methods merely concatenate isolated signs, resulting in poor visual coherence and semantic accuracy in the generated videos. Unlike textual languages,sign language is inherently rich in spatial-temporal cues, making it more complex to model. To address this,we propose StgcDiff, a graph-based conditional diffusion framework that generates smooth transitions between discrete signs by capturing the unique spatial-temporal dependencies of sign language. Specifically, we first train an encoder-decoder architecture to learn a structure-aware representation of spatial-temporal skeleton sequences. Next, we optimize a diffusion denoiser conditioned on the representations learned by the pre-trained encoder, which is tasked with predicting transition frames from noise. Additionally, we design the Sign-GCN module as the key component in our framework, which effectively models the spatial-temporal features. Extensive experiments conducted on the PHOENIX14T, USTC-CSL100,and USTC-SLR500 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

  Despite recent advances in sparse novel view synthesis (NVS) applied to object-centric scenes, scene-level NVS remains a challenge. A central issue is the lack of available clean multi-view training data, beyond manually curated datasets with limited diversity, camera variation, or licensing issues. On the other hand, an abundance of diverse and permissively-licensed data exists in the wild, consisting of scenes with varying appearances (illuminations, transient occlusions, etc.) from sources such as tourist photos. To this end, we present WildCAT3D, a framework for generating novel views of scenes learned from diverse 2D scene image data captured in the wild. We unlock training on these data sources by explicitly modeling global appearance conditions in images, extending the state-of-the-art multi-view diffusion paradigm to learn from scene views of varying appearances. Our trained model generalizes to new scenes at inference time, enabling the generation of multiple consistent novel views. WildCAT3D provides state-of-the-art results on single-view NVS in object- and scene-level settings, while training on strictly less data sources than prior methods. Additionally, it enables novel applications by providing global appearance control during generation.

  Video object removal and inpainting are critical tasks in the fields of computer vision and multimedia processing, aimed at restoring missing or corrupted regions in video sequences. Traditional methods predominantly rely on flow-based propagation and spatio-temporal Transformers, but these approaches face limitations in effectively leveraging long-term temporal features and ensuring temporal consistency in the completion results, particularly when dealing with large masks. Consequently, performance on extensive masked areas remains suboptimal. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel video inpainting approach leveraging the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). DiT synergistically combines the advantages of diffusion models and transformer architectures to maintain long-term temporal consistency while ensuring high-quality inpainting results. We propose a Circular Position-Shift strategy to further enhance long-term temporal consistency during the inference stage. Additionally, the proposed method automatically detects objects within videos, interactively removes specified objects, and generates corresponding prompts. In terms of processing speed, it takes only 180 seconds (testing on one NVIDIA A100 GPU) to complete a video with a resolution of $1080 \times 1920$ with 121 frames without any acceleration method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method demonstrates superior performance in content fidelity, texture restoration, and temporal consistency. Project page:this https URL.

  Reconstructing a 3D point cloud from a given conditional sketch is challenging. Existing methods often work directly in 3D space, but domain variability and difficulty in reconstructing accurate 3D structures from 2D sketches remain significant obstacles. Moreover, ideal models should also accept prompts for control, in addition with the sparse sketch, posing challenges in multi-modal fusion. We propose DiffS-NOCS (Diffusion-based Sketch-to-NOCS Map), which leverages ControlNet with a modified multi-view decoder to generate NOCS maps with embedded 3D structure and position information in 2D space from sketches. The 3D point cloud is reconstructed by combining multiple NOCS maps from different views. To enhance sketch understanding, we integrate a viewpoint encoder for extracting viewpoint features. Additionally, we design a feature-level multi-view aggregation network as the denoising module, facilitating cross-view information exchange and improving 3D consistency in NOCS map generation. Experiments on ShapeNet demonstrate that DiffS-NOCS achieves controllable and fine-grained point cloud reconstruction aligned with sketches.

  Single-view textured human reconstruction aims to reconstruct a clothed 3D digital human by inputting a monocular 2D image. Existing approaches include feed-forward methods, limited by scarce 3D human data, and diffusion-based methods, prone to erroneous 2D hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose a novel SMPL normal map Equipped 3D Human Reconstruction (SEHR) framework, integrating a pretrained large 3D reconstruction model with human geometry prior. SEHR performs single-view human reconstruction without using a preset diffusion model in one forward propagation. Concretely, SEHR consists of two key components: SMPL Normal Map Guidance (SNMG) and SMPL Normal Map Constraint (SNMC). SNMG incorporates SMPL normal maps into an auxiliary network to provide improved body shape guidance. SNMC enhances invisible body parts by constraining the model to predict an extra SMPL normal Gaussians. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEHR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

  We tackle the challenge of generating dynamic 4D scenes from monocular, multi-object videos with heavy occlusions, and introduce GenMOJO, a novel approach that integrates rendering-based deformable 3D Gaussian optimization with generative priors for view synthesis. While existing models perform well on novel view synthesis for isolated objects, they struggle to generalize to complex, cluttered scenes. To address this, GenMOJO decomposes the scene into individual objects, optimizing a differentiable set of deformable Gaussians per object. This object-wise decomposition allows leveraging object-centric diffusion models to infer unobserved regions in novel viewpoints. It performs joint Gaussian splatting to render the full scene, capturing cross-object occlusions, and enabling occlusion-aware supervision. To bridge the gap between object-centric priors and the global frame-centric coordinate system of videos, GenMOJO uses differentiable transformations that align generative and rendering constraints within a unified framework. The resulting model generates 4D object reconstructions over space and time, and produces accurate 2D and 3D point tracks from monocular input. Quantitative evaluations and perceptual human studies confirm that GenMOJO generates more realistic novel views of scenes and produces more accurate point tracks compared to existing approaches.

  The malformed hands in the AI-generated images seriously affect the authenticity of the images. To refine malformed hands, existing depth-based approaches use a hand depth estimator to guide the refinement of malformed hands. Due to the performance limitations of the hand depth estimator, many hand details cannot be represented, resulting in errors in the generated hands, such as confusing the palm and the back of the hand. To solve this problem, we propose a 3D mesh-guided refinement framework using a diffusion pipeline. We use a state-of-the-art 3D hand mesh estimator, which provides more details of the hands. For training, we collect and reannotate a dataset consisting of RGB images and 3D hand mesh. Then we design a diffusion inpainting model to generate refined outputs guided by 3D hand meshes. For inference, we propose a double check algorithm to facilitate the 3D hand mesh estimator to obtain robust hand mesh guidance to obtain our refined results. Beyond malformed hand refinement, we propose a novel hand pose transformation method. It increases the flexibility and diversity of the malformed hand refinement task. We made the restored images mimic the hand poses of the reference images. The pose transformation requires no additional training. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.

  Image inpainting is the task of reconstructing missing or damaged parts of an image in a way that seamlessly blends with the surrounding content. With the advent of advanced generative models, especially diffusion models and generative adversarial networks, inpainting has achieved remarkable improvements in visual quality and coherence. However, achieving seamless continuity remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose two novel methods to address discrepancy issues in diffusion-based inpainting models. First, we introduce a modified Variational Autoencoder that corrects color imbalances, ensuring that the final inpainted results are free of color mismatches. Second, we propose a two-step training strategy that improves the blending of generated and existing image content during the diffusion process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our methods effectively reduce discontinuity and produce high-quality inpainting results that are coherent and visually appealing.

  Paucity of medical data severely limits the generalizability of diagnostic ML models, as the full spectrum of disease variability can not be represented by a small clinical dataset. To address this, diffusion models (DMs) have been considered as a promising avenue for synthetic image generation and augmentation. However, they frequently produce medically inaccurate images, deteriorating the model performance. Expert domain knowledge is critical for synthesizing images that correctly encode clinical information, especially when data is scarce and quality outweighs quantity. Existing approaches for incorporating human feedback, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on robust reward functions or demand labor-intensive expert evaluations. Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reveals their strong visual reasoning capabilities, making them adept candidates as evaluators. In this work, we propose a novel framework, coined MAGIC (Medically Accurate Generation of Images through AI-Expert Collaboration), that synthesizes clinically accurate skin disease images for data augmentation. Our method creatively translates expert-defined criteria into actionable feedback for image synthesis of DMs, significantly improving clinical accuracy while reducing the direct human workload. Experiments demonstrate that our method greatly improves the clinical quality of synthesized skin disease images, with outputs aligning with dermatologist assessments. Additionally, augmenting training data with these synthesized images improves diagnostic accuracy by +9.02% on a challenging 20-condition skin disease classification task, and by +13.89% in the few-shot setting.

  Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, yet generating coherent image sequences for visual storytelling remains challenging. A key challenge is effectively leveraging all previous text-image pairs, referred to as history text-image pairs, which provide contextual information for maintaining consistency across frames. Existing auto-regressive methods condition on all past image-text pairs but require extensive training, while training-free subject-specific approaches ensure consistency but lack adaptability to narrative prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-modal history adapter for text-to-image diffusion models, \textbf{ViSTA}. It consists of (1) a multi-modal history fusion module to extract relevant history features and (2) a history adapter to condition the generation on the extracted relevant features. We also introduce a salient history selection strategy during inference, where the most salient history text-image pair is selected, improving the quality of the conditioning. Furthermore, we propose to employ a Visual Question Answering-based metric TIFA to assess text-image alignment in visual storytelling, providing a more targeted and interpretable assessment of generated images. Evaluated on the StorySalon and FlintStonesSV dataset, our proposed ViSTA model is not only consistent across different frames, but also well-aligned with the narrative text descriptions.

  We introduce TransDiff, the first image generation model that marries Autoregressive (AR) Transformer with diffusion models. In this joint modeling framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore, building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open up a new frontier in the field of image generation.

  We present Genesis, a unified framework for joint generation of multi-view driving videos and LiDAR sequences with spatio-temporal and cross-modal consistency. Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics (FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611), and benefits downstream tasks including segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical utility of the generated data.

  Recent advances in generative modeling have enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic data that is applicable in a variety of domains, including face recognition. Here, state-of-the-art generative models typically rely on conditioning and fine-tuning of powerful pretrained diffusion models to facilitate the synthesis of realistic images of a desired identity. Yet, these models often do not consider the identity of subjects during training, leading to poor consistency between generated and intended identities. In contrast, methods that employ identity-based training objectives tend to overfit on various aspects of the identity, and in turn, lower the diversity of images that can be generated. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel generative diffusion-based framework, called ID-Booth. ID-Booth consists of a denoising network responsible for data generation, a variational auto-encoder for mapping images to and from a lower-dimensional latent space and a text encoder that allows for prompt-based control over the generation procedure. The framework utilizes a novel triplet identity training objective and enables identity-consistent image generation while retaining the synthesis capabilities of pretrained diffusion models. Experiments with a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model and diverse prompts reveal that our method facilitates better intra-identity consistency and inter-identity separability than competing methods, while achieving higher image diversity. In turn, the produced data allows for effective augmentation of small-scale datasets and training of better-performing recognition models in a privacy-preserving manner. The source code for the ID-Booth framework is publicly available atthis https URL.

  We introduce R2LDM, an innovative approach for generating dense and accurate 4D radar point clouds, guided by corresponding LiDAR point clouds. Instead of utilizing range images or bird's eye view (BEV) images, we represent both LiDAR and 4D radar point clouds using voxel features, which more effectively capture 3D shape information. Subsequently, we propose the Latent Voxel Diffusion Model (LVDM), which performs the diffusion process in the latent space. Additionally, a novel Latent Point Cloud Reconstruction (LPCR) module is utilized to reconstruct point clouds from high-dimensional latent voxel features. As a result, R2LDM effectively generates LiDAR-like point clouds from paired raw radar data. We evaluate our approach on two different datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves 6- to 10-fold densification of radar point clouds, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in 4D radar point cloud super-resolution. Furthermore, the enhanced radar point clouds generated by our method significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving up to 31.7% improvement in point cloud registration recall rate and 24.9% improvement in object detection accuracy.

  Restoring low-resolution text images presents a significant challenge, as it requires maintaining both the fidelity and stylistic realism of the text in restored images. Existing text image restoration methods often fall short in hard situations, as the traditional super-resolution models cannot guarantee clarity, while diffusion-based methods fail to maintain fidelity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at improving the generalization ability of diffusion models for text image super-resolution (SR), especially promoting fidelity. First, we propose a progressive data sampling strategy that incorporates diverse image types at different stages of training, stabilizing the convergence and improving the generalization. For the network architecture, we leverage a pre-trained SR prior to provide robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enhancing the model's ability to preserve textual information. Additionally, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to better integrate textual priors. To further reduce errors in textual priors, we utilize confidence scores to dynamically adjust the importance of textual features during training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only produces text images with more realistic visual appearances but also improves the accuracy of text structure.

  Recent advancements in video generation have enabled models to synthesize high-quality, minute-long videos. However, generating even longer videos with temporal coherence remains a major challenge and existing length extrapolation methods lead to temporal repetition or motion deceleration. In this work, we systematically analyze the role of frequency components in positional embeddings and identify an intrinsic frequency that primarily governs extrapolation behavior. Based on this insight, we propose RIFLEx, a minimal yet effective approach that reduces the intrinsic frequency to suppress repetition while preserving motion consistency, without requiring any additional modifications. RIFLEx offers a true free lunch--achieving high-quality 2x extrapolation on state-of-the-art video diffusion transformers in a completely training-free manner. Moreover, it enhances quality and enables 3x extrapolation by minimal fine-tuning without long videos. Project page and codes:this https URL.

  Latent diffusion models have recently demonstrated superior capabilities in many downstream image synthesis tasks. However, customization of latent diffusion models using unauthorized data can severely compromise the privacy and intellectual property rights of data owners. Adversarial examples as protective perturbations have been developed to defend against unauthorized data usage by introducing imperceptible noise to customization samples, preventing diffusion models from effectively learning them. In this paper, we first reveal that the primary reason adversarial examples are effective as protective perturbations in latent diffusion models is the distortion of their latent representations, as demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative experiments. We then propose the Contrastive Adversarial Training (CAT) utilizing lightweight adapters as an adaptive attack against these protection methods, highlighting their lack of robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CAT method significantly reduces the effectiveness of protective perturbations in customization, urging the community to reconsider and improve the robustness of existing protective perturbations.

  State-of-the-art Diffusion Models (DMs) produce highly realistic images. While prior work has successfully mitigated Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content in the visual domain, we identify a novel threat: the generation of NSFW text embedded within images. This includes offensive language, such as insults, racial slurs, and sexually explicit terms, posing significant risks to users. We show that all state-of-the-art DMs (e.g., SD3, SDXL, Flux, DeepFloyd IF) are vulnerable to this issue. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that existing mitigation techniques, effective for visual content, fail to prevent harmful text generation while substantially degrading benign text generation. As an initial step toward addressing this threat, we introduce a novel fine-tuning strategy that targets only the text-generation layers in DMs. Therefore, we construct a safety fine-tuning dataset by pairing each NSFW prompt with two images: one with the NSFW term, and another where that term is replaced with a carefully crafted benign alternative while leaving the image unchanged otherwise. By training on this dataset, the model learns to avoid generating harmful text while preserving benign content and overall image quality. Finally, to advance research in the area, we release ToxicBench, an open-source benchmark for evaluating NSFW text generation in images. It includes our curated fine-tuning dataset, a set of harmful prompts, new evaluation metrics, and a pipeline that assesses both NSFW-ness and text and image quality. Our benchmark aims to guide future efforts in mitigating NSFW text generation in text-to-image models, thereby contributing to their safe deployment. The benchmark is available online for download.

  Transparent and reflective objects, which are common in our everyday lives, present a significant challenge to 3D imaging techniques due to their unique visual and optical properties. Faced with these types of objects, RGB-D cameras fail to capture the real depth value with their accurate spatial information. To address this issue, we propose DITR, a diffusion-based Depth Inpainting framework specifically designed for Transparent and Reflective objects. This network consists of two stages, including a Region Proposal stage and a Depth Inpainting stage. DITR dynamically analyzes the optical and geometric depth loss and inpaints them automatically. Furthermore, comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that DITR is highly effective in depth inpainting tasks of transparent and reflective objects with robust adaptability.

  Directly learning to model 4D content, including shape, color, and motion, is challenging. Existing methods rely on pose priors for motion control, resulting in limited motion diversity and continuity in details. To address this, we propose a framework that generates volumetric 4D sequences, where 3D shapes are animated under given conditions (text-image guidance) with dynamic evolution in shape and color across spatial and temporal dimensions, allowing for free navigation and rendering from any direction. We first use a coherent 3D shape and color modeling to encode the shape and color of each detailed 3D geometry frame into a latent space. Then we propose a matrixized 4D sequence representation allowing efficient diffusion model operation. Finally, we introduce spatio-temporal diffusion for 4D volumetric generation under given images and text prompts. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNet, 3DBiCar, DeformingThings4D and Objaverse datasets for several tasks demonstrate that our method effectively learns to generate high quality 3D shapes with consistent color and coherent mesh animations, improving over the current methods. Our code will be publicly available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Policy has demonstrated strong visuomotor modeling capabilities, but its high computational cost renders it impractical for real-time robotic control. Despite huge redundancy across repetitive denoising steps, existing diffusion acceleration techniques fail to generalize to Diffusion Policy due to fundamental architectural and data divergences. In this paper, we propose Block-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by caching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation acceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block level, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly across timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose the Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps by maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped features. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant error surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly within Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop the Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the upstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a training-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based Diffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference speedup for free.

  Many real-world machine learning tasks require outputs that satisfy hard constraints, such as physical conservation laws, structured dependencies in graphs, or column-level relationships in tabular data. Existing approaches rely either on domain-specific architectures and losses or on strong assumptions on the constraint space, restricting their applicability to linear or convex constraints. We propose a general-purpose framework for constraint-aware refinement that leverages denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs). Starting from a coarse prediction, our method iteratively refines it through a deterministic diffusion trajectory guided by a learned prior and augmented by constraint gradient corrections. The approach accommodates a wide class of non-convex and nonlinear equality constraints and can be applied post hoc to any base model. We demonstrate the method in two representative domains: constrained adversarial attack generation on tabular data with column-level dependencies and in AC power flow prediction under Kirchhoff's laws. Across both settings, our diffusion-guided refinement improves both constraint satisfaction and performance while remaining lightweight and model-agnostic.
