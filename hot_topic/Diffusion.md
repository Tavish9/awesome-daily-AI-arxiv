- **[Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03072)**  `arXiv:2410.03072`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.MA`

  Diffusion models have recently been successfully applied to a wide range of robotics applications for learning complex multi-modal behaviors from data. However, prior works have mostly been confined to single-robot and small-scale environments due to the high sample complexity of learning multi-robot diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a method for generating collision-free multi-robot trajectories that conform to underlying data distributions while using only single-robot data. Our algorithm, Multi-robot Multi-model planning Diffusion (MMD), does so by combining learned diffusion models with classical search-based techniques -- generating data-driven motions under collision constraints. Scaling further, we show how to compose multiple diffusion models to plan in large environments where a single diffusion model fails to generalize well. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning for dozens of robots in a variety of simulated scenarios motivated by logistics environments.

- **[Non-stationary Diffusion For Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04278)**  `arXiv:2505.04278`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  Due to the dynamics of underlying physics and external influences, the uncertainty of time series often varies over time. However, existing Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) often fail to capture this non-stationary nature, constrained by their constant variance assumption from the additive noise model (ANM). In this paper, we innovatively utilize the Location-Scale Noise Model (LSNM) to relax the fixed uncertainty assumption of ANM. A diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework, termed Non-stationary Diffusion (NsDiff), is designed based on LSNM that is capable of modeling the changing pattern of uncertainty. Specifically, NsDiff combines a denoising diffusion-based conditional generative model with a pre-trained conditional mean and variance estimator, enabling adaptive endpoint distribution modeling. Furthermore, we propose an uncertainty-aware noise schedule, which dynamically adjusts the noise levels to accurately reflect the data uncertainty at each step and integrates the time-varying variances into the diffusion process. Extensive experiments conducted on nine real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of NsDiff compared to existing approaches. Code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Diffusion Models are Secretly Exchangeable: Parallelizing DDPMs via Autospeculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03983)**  `arXiv:2505.03983`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Hengyuan Hu, Aniket Das, Dorsa Sadigh, Nima Anari_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generative modeling. However, their sequential computation requirements lead to significant inference-time bottlenecks. In this work, we utilize the connection between DDPMs and Stochastic Localization to prove that, under an appropriate reparametrization, the increments of DDPM satisfy an exchangeability property. This general insight enables near-black-box adaptation of various performance optimization techniques from autoregressive models to the diffusion setting. To demonstrate this, we introduce \emph{Autospeculative Decoding} (ASD), an extension of the widely used speculative decoding algorithm to DDPMs that does not require any auxiliary draft models. Our theoretical analysis shows that ASD achieves a $\tilde{O} (K^{\frac{1}{3}})$ parallel runtime speedup over the $K$ step sequential DDPM. We also demonstrate that a practical implementation of autospeculative decoding accelerates DDPM inference significantly in various domains.

- **[A Time-Series Data Augmentation Model through Diffusion and Transformer Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03790)**  `arXiv:2505.03790`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yuren Zhang, Zhongnan Pu, Lei Jing_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the development of Artificial Intelligence, numerous real-world tasks have been accomplished using technology integrated with deep learning. To achieve optimal performance, deep neural networks typically require large volumes of data for training. Although advances in data augmentation have facilitated the acquisition of vast datasets, most of this data is concentrated in domains like images and speech. However, there has been relatively less focus on augmenting time-series data. To address this gap and generate a substantial amount of time-series data, we propose a simple and effective method that combines the Diffusion and Transformer models. By utilizing an adjusted diffusion denoising model to generate a large volume of initial time-step action data, followed by employing a Transformer model to predict subsequent actions, and incorporating a weighted loss function to achieve convergence, the method demonstrates its effectiveness. Using the performance improvement of the model after applying augmented data as a benchmark, and comparing the results with those obtained without data augmentation or using traditional data augmentation methods, this approach shows its capability to produce high-quality augmented data.

- **[Riemannian Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04338)**  `arXiv:2505.04338`  `cs.LG`  
  _Zichen Liu, Wei Zhang, Christof Sch√ºtte, Tiejun Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Riemannian Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (RDDPMs) for learning distributions on submanifolds of Euclidean space that are level sets of functions, including most of the manifolds relevant to applications. Existing methods for generative modeling on manifolds rely on substantial geometric information such as geodesic curves or eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and, as a result, they are limited to manifolds where such information is available. In contrast, our method, built on a projection scheme, can be applied to more general manifolds, as it only requires being able to evaluate the value and the first order derivatives of the function that defines the submanifold. We provide a theoretical analysis of our method in the continuous-time limit, which elucidates the connection between our RDDPMs and score-based generative models on manifolds. The capability of our method is demonstrated on datasets from previous studies and on new datasets sampled from two high-dimensional manifolds, i.e. $\mathrm{SO}(10)$ and the configuration space of molecular system alanine dipeptide with fixed dihedral angle.

  _Zixiao Wang, Wenqian Zhao, Yunheng Shen, Yang Bai, Guojin Chen, Farzan Farnia, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in layout pattern generation have been dominated by deep generative models. However, relying solely on neural networks for legality guarantees raises concerns in many practical applications. In this paper, we present \tool{DiffPattern}-Flex, a novel approach designed to generate reliable layout patterns efficiently. \tool{DiffPattern}-Flex incorporates a new method for generating diverse topologies using a discrete diffusion model while maintaining a lossless and compute-efficient layout representation. To ensure legal pattern generation, we employ {an} optimization-based, white-box pattern assessment process based on specific design rules. Furthermore, fast sampling and efficient legalization technologies are employed to accelerate the generation process. Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that \tool{DiffPattern}-Flex significantly outperforms existing methods and excels at producing reliable layout patterns.

- **[Efficient Flow Matching using Latent Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04486)**  `arXiv:2505.04486`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Anirban Samaddar, Yixuan Sun, Viktor Nilsson, Sandeep Madireddy_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flow matching models have shown great potential in image generation tasks among probabilistic generative models. Building upon the ideas of continuous normalizing flows, flow matching models generalize the transport path of the diffusion models from a simple prior distribution to the data. Most flow matching models in the literature do not explicitly model the underlying structure/manifold in the target data when learning the flow from a simple source distribution like the standard Gaussian. This leads to inefficient learning, especially for many high-dimensional real-world datasets, which often reside in a low-dimensional manifold. Existing strategies of incorporating manifolds, including data with underlying multi-modal distribution, often require expensive training and hence frequently lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we present \texttt{Latent-CFM}, which provides simplified training/inference strategies to incorporate multi-modal data structures using pretrained deep latent variable models. Through experiments on multi-modal synthetic data and widely used image benchmark datasets, we show that \texttt{Latent-CFM} exhibits improved generation quality with significantly less training ($\sim 50\%$ less in some cases) and computation than state-of-the-art flow matching models. Using a 2d Darcy flow dataset, we demonstrate that our approach generates more physically accurate samples than competitive approaches. In addition, through latent space analysis, we demonstrate that our approach can be used for conditional image generation conditioned on latent features.

  _Pengfei Guo, Can Zhao, Dong Yang, Yufan He, Vishwesh Nath, Ziyue Xu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating 3D CT volumes from descriptive free-text inputs presents a transformative opportunity in diagnostics and research. In this paper, we introduce Text2CT, a novel approach for synthesizing 3D CT volumes from textual descriptions using the diffusion model. Unlike previous methods that rely on fixed-format text input, Text2CT employs a novel prompt formulation that enables generation from diverse, free-text descriptions. The proposed framework encodes medical text into latent representations and decodes them into high-resolution 3D CT scans, effectively bridging the gap between semantic text inputs and detailed volumetric representations in a unified 3D framework. Our method demonstrates superior performance in preserving anatomical fidelity and capturing intricate structures as described in the input text. Extensive evaluations show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, offering promising potential applications in diagnostics, and data augmentation.

- **[CountDiffusion: Text-to-Image Synthesis with Training-Free Counting-Guidance Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04347)**  `arXiv:2505.04347`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yanyu Li, Pencheng Wan, Liang Han, Yaowei Wang, Liqiang Nie, Min Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Stable Diffusion has advanced text-to-image synthesis, but training models to generate images with accurate object quantity is still difficult due to the high computational cost and the challenge of teaching models the abstract concept of quantity. In this paper, we propose CountDiffusion, a training-free framework aiming at generating images with correct object quantity from textual descriptions. CountDiffusion consists of two stages. In the first stage, an intermediate denoising result is generated by the diffusion model to predict the final synthesized image with one-step denoising, and a counting model is used to count the number of objects in this image. In the second stage, a correction module is used to correct the object quantity by changing the attention map of the object with universal guidance. The proposed CountDiffusion can be plugged into any diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) generation models without further training. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed CountDiffusion, which improves the accurate object quantity generation ability of T2I models by a large margin.

- **[MoDE: Mixture of Diffusion Experts for Any Occluded Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04306)**  `arXiv:2505.04306`  `cs.CV`  
  _Qiannan Fan, Zhuoyang Li, Jitong Li, Chenyang Cao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the continuous impact of epidemics, people have become accustomed to wearing masks. However, most current occluded face recognition (OFR) algorithms lack prior knowledge of occlusions, resulting in poor performance when dealing with occluded faces of varying types and severity in reality. Recognizing occluded faces is still a significant challenge, which greatly affects the convenience of people's daily lives. In this paper, we propose an identity-gated mixture of diffusion experts (MoDE) for OFR. Each diffusion-based generative expert estimates one possible complete image for occluded faces. Considering the random sampling process of the diffusion model, which introduces inevitable differences and variations between the inpainted faces and the real ones. To ensemble effective information from multi-reconstructed faces, we introduce an identity-gating network to evaluate the contribution of each reconstructed face to the identity and adaptively integrate the predictions in the decision space. Moreover, our MoDE is a plug-and-play module for most existing face recognition models. Extensive experiments on three public face datasets and two datasets in the wild validate our advanced performance for various occlusions in comparison with the competing methods.

- **[TS-Diff: Two-Stage Diffusion Model for Low-Light RAW Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04281)**  `arXiv:2505.04281`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yi Li, Zhiyuan Zhang, Jiangnan Xia, Jianghan Cheng, Qilong Wu, Junwei Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a novel Two-Stage Diffusion Model (TS-Diff) for enhancing extremely low-light RAW images. In the pre-training stage, TS-Diff synthesizes noisy images by constructing multiple virtual cameras based on a noise space. Camera Feature Integration (CFI) modules are then designed to enable the model to learn generalizable features across diverse virtual cameras. During the aligning stage, CFIs are averaged to create a target-specific CFI$^T$, which is fine-tuned using a small amount of real RAW data to adapt to the noise characteristics of specific cameras. A structural reparameterization technique further simplifies CFI$^T$ for efficient deployment. To address color shifts during the diffusion process, a color corrector is introduced to ensure color consistency by dynamically adjusting global color distributions. Additionally, a novel dataset, QID, is constructed, featuring quantifiable illumination levels and a wide dynamic range, providing a comprehensive benchmark for training and evaluation under extreme low-light conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that TS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, including QID, SID, and ELD, excelling in denoising, generalization, and color consistency across various cameras and illumination levels. These findings highlight the robustness and versatility of TS-Diff, making it a practical solution for low-light imaging applications. Source codes and models are available atthis https URL

- **[Bridging Geometry-Coherent Text-to-3D Generation with Multi-View Diffusion Priors and Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04262)**  `arXiv:2505.04262`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) leverages pretrained 2D diffusion models to advance text-to-3D generation but neglects multi-view correlations, being prone to geometric inconsistencies and multi-face artifacts in the generated 3D content. In this work, we propose Coupled Score Distillation (CSD), a framework that couples multi-view joint distribution priors to ensure geometrically consistent 3D generation while enabling the stable and direct optimization of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, by reformulating the optimization as a multi-view joint optimization problem, we derive an effective optimization rule that effectively couples multi-view priors to guide optimization across different viewpoints while preserving the diversity of generated 3D assets. Additionally, we propose a framework that directly optimizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) with random initialization to generate geometrically consistent 3D content. We further employ a deformable tetrahedral grid, initialized from 3D-GS and refined through CSD, to produce high-quality, refined meshes. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and competitive quality of our approach.

- **[No Other Representation Component Is Needed: Diffusion Transformers Can Provide Representation Guidance by Themselves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02831)**  `arXiv:2505.02831`  `cs.CV`  
  _Dengyang Jiang, Mengmeng Wang, Liuzhuozheng Li, Lei Zhang, Haoyu Wang, Wei Wei, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies have demonstrated that learning a meaningful internal representation can both accelerate generative training and enhance generation quality of the diffusion transformers. However, existing approaches necessitate to either introduce an additional and complex representation training framework or rely on a large-scale, pre-trained representation foundation model to provide representation guidance during the original generative training process. In this study, we posit that the unique discriminative process inherent to diffusion transformers enables them to offer such guidance without requiring external representation components. We therefore propose Self-Representation Alignment (SRA), a simple yet straightforward method that obtain representation guidance through a self-distillation manner. Specifically, SRA aligns the output latent representation of the diffusion transformer in earlier layer with higher noise to that in later layer with lower noise to progressively enhance the overall representation learning during only generative training process. Experimental results indicate that applying SRA to DiTs and SiTs yields consistent performance improvements. Moreover, SRA not only significantly outperforms approaches relying on auxiliary, complex representation training frameworks but also achieves performance comparable to methods that heavily dependent on powerful external representation priors.

  Recent years have seen remarkable progress in both multimodal understanding models and image generation models. Despite their respective successes, these two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally, we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and data. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid advancements and will regularly update this survey. Our goal is to inspire further research and provide a valuable reference for the community. The references associated with this survey are available on GitHub (this https URL).

  We introduce Ming-Lite-Uni, an open-source multimodal framework featuring a newly designed unified visual generator and a native multimodal autoregressive model tailored for unifying vision and language. Specifically, this project provides an open-source implementation of the integrated MetaQueries and M2-omni framework, while introducing the novel multi-scale learnable tokens and multi-scale representation alignment strategy. By leveraging a fixed MLLM and a learnable diffusion model, Ming-Lite-Uni enables native multimodal AR models to perform both text-to-image generation and instruction based image editing tasks, expanding their capabilities beyond pure visual understanding. Our experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of Ming-Lite-Uni and illustrate the impressive fluid nature of its interactive process. All code and model weights are open-sourced to foster further exploration within the community. Notably, this work aligns with concurrent multimodal AI milestones - such as ChatGPT-4o with native image generation updated in March 25, 2025 - underscoring the broader significance of unified models like Ming-Lite-Uni on the path toward AGI. Ming-Lite-Uni is in alpha stage and will soon be further refined.

- **[Probability Density Geodesics in Image Diffusion Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06675)**  `arXiv:2504.06675`  `cs.CV`  
  _Qingtao Yu, Jaskirat Singh, Zhaoyuan Yang, Peter Henry Tu, Jing Zhang, Hongdong Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models indirectly estimate the probability density over a data space, which can be used to study its structure. In this work, we show that geodesics can be computed in diffusion latent space, where the norm induced by the spatially-varying inner product is inversely proportional to the probability density. In this formulation, a path that traverses a high density (that is, probable) region of image latent space is shorter than the equivalent path through a low density region. We present algorithms for solving the associated initial and boundary value problems and show how to compute the probability density along the path and the geodesic distance between two points. Using these techniques, we analyze how closely video clips approximate geodesics in a pre-trained image diffusion space. Finally, we demonstrate how these techniques can be applied to training-free image sequence interpolation and extrapolation, given a pre-trained image diffusion model.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image generation via Stable Diffusion models (SDM) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, their computational intensity, particularly in the iterative denoising process, hinders real-time deployment in latency-sensitive applications. While Recent studies have explored post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) methods to compress Diffusion models, existing methods often overlook the consistency between results generated by quantized models and those from floating-point models. This consistency is paramount for professional applications where both efficiency and output reliability are essential. To ensure that quantized SDM generates high-quality and consistent images, we propose an efficient quantization framework for SDM. Our framework introduces a Serial-to-Parallel pipeline that simultaneously maintains training-inference consistency and ensures optimization stability. Building upon this foundation, we further develop several techniques including multi-timestep activation quantization, time information precalculation, inter-layer distillation, and selective freezing, to achieve high-fidelity generation in comparison to floating-point models while maintaining quantization efficiency.Through comprehensive evaluation across multiple Stable Diffusion variants (v1-4, v2-1, XL 1.0, and v3), our method demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches with shorter training times. Under W4A8 quantization settings, we achieve significant improvements in both distribution similarity and visual fidelity, while preserving a high image quality.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To enhance the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models, current ControlNet-like models have explored various control signals to dictate image attributes. However, existing methods either handle conditions inefficiently or use a fixed number of conditions, which does not fully address the complexity of multiple conditions and their potential conflicts. This underscores the need for innovative approaches to manage multiple conditions effectively for more reliable and detailed image synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, DynamicControl, which supports dynamic combinations of diverse control signals, allowing adaptive selection of different numbers and types of conditions. Our approach begins with a double-cycle controller that generates an initial real score sorting for all input conditions by leveraging pre-trained conditional generation models and discriminative models. This controller evaluates the similarity between extracted conditions and input conditions, as well as the pixel-level similarity with the source image. Then, we integrate a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to build an efficient condition evaluator. This evaluator optimizes the ordering of conditions based on the double-cycle controller's score ranking. Our method jointly optimizes MLLMs and diffusion models, utilizing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities to facilitate multi-condition text-to-image (T2I) tasks. The final sorted conditions are fed into a parallel multi-control adapter, which learns feature maps from dynamic visual conditions and integrates them to modulate ControlNet, thereby enhancing control over generated images. Through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, DynamicControl demonstrates its superiority over existing methods in terms of controllability, generation quality and composability under various conditional controls.

  The field of controllable human-centric video generation has witnessed remarkable progress, particularly with the advent of diffusion models. However, achieving precise and localized control over human motion in videos, such as replacing or inserting individuals while preserving desired motion patterns, still remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we present the ReplaceAnyone framework, which focuses on localized human replacement and insertion featuring intricate backgrounds. Specifically, we formulate this task as an image-conditioned video inpainting paradigm with pose guidance, utilizing a unified end-to-end video diffusion architecture that facilitates image-conditioned video inpainting within masked regions. To prevent shape leakage and enable granular local control, we introduce diverse mask forms involving both regular and irregular shapes. Furthermore, we implement an enriched visual guidance mechanism to enhance appearance alignment, a hybrid inpainting encoder to further preserve the detailed background information in the masked video, and a two-phase optimization methodology to simplify the training difficulty. ReplaceAnyone enables seamless replacement or insertion of characters while maintaining the desired pose motion and reference appearance within a single framework. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating realistic and coherent video content. The proposed ReplaceAnyone can be seamlessly applied not only to traditional 3D-UNet base models but also to DiT-based video models such as Wan2.1. The code will be available atthis https URL.

  _Sandra Zhang Ding, Jiafeng Mao, Kiyoharu Aizawa_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Based on recent advanced diffusion models, Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have demonstrated their capabilities to generate diverse and high-quality images. However, leveraging their potential for real-world content creation, particularly in providing users with precise control over the image generation result, poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an innovative training-free pipeline that extends existing text-to-image generation models to incorporate a sketch as an additional condition. To generate new images with a layout and structure closely resembling the input sketch, we find that these core features of a sketch can be tracked with the cross-attention maps of diffusion models. We introduce latent optimization, a method that refines the noisy latent at each intermediate step of the generation process using cross-attention maps to ensure that the generated images adhere closely to the desired structure outlined in the reference sketch. Through latent optimization, our method enhances the accuracy of image generation, offering users greater control and customization options in content creation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurately modeling the effects of illumination and shadows during head rotation is critical in computer vision for enhancing image realism and reducing artifacts. This study delves into the latent space of denoising diffusion models to identify compelling trajectories that can express continuous head rotation under varying lighting conditions. A key contribution of our work is the generation of additional labels from the CelebA dataset,categorizing images into three groups based on prevalent illumination direction: left, center, and right. These labels play a crucial role in our approach, enabling more precise manipulations and improved handling of lighting variations. Leveraging a recent embedding technique for Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM), our method achieves noteworthy manipulations, encompassing a wide rotation angle of $\pm 30$ degrees, while preserving individual distinct characteristics even under challenging illumination conditions. Our methodology involves computing trajectories that approximate clouds of latent representations of dataset samples with different yaw rotations through linear regression. Specific trajectories are obtained by analyzing subsets of data that share significant attributes with the source image, including light direction. Notably, our approach does not require any specific training of the generative model for the task of rotation; we merely compute and follow specific trajectories in the latent space of a pre-trained face generation model. This article showcases the potential of our approach and its current limitations through a qualitative discussion of notable examples. This study contributes to the ongoing advancements in representation learning and the semantic investigation of the latent space of generative models.
