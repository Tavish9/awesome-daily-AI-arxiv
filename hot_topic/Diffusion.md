- **[ReinFlow: Fine-tuning Flow Matching Policy with Online Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22094)**  `arXiv:2505.22094`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`  
  _Tonghe Zhang, Yu Chao, Sicang Su, Yu Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose ReinFlow, a simple yet effective online reinforcement learning (RL) framework that fine-tunes a family of flow matching policies for continuous robotic control. Derived from rigorous RL theory, ReinFlow injects learnable noise into a flow policy's deterministic path, converting the flow into a discrete-time Markov Process for exact and straightforward likelihood computation. This conversion facilitates exploration and ensures training stability, enabling ReinFlow to fine-tune diverse flow model variants, including Rectified Flow [35] and Shortcut Models [19], particularly at very few or even one denoising step. We benchmark ReinFlow in representative locomotion and manipulation tasks, including long-horizon planning with visual input and sparse reward. The episode reward of Rectified Flow policies obtained an average net growth of 135.36% after fine-tuning in challenging legged locomotion tasks while saving denoising steps and 82.63% of wall time compared to state-of-the-art diffusion RL fine-tuning method DPPO [43]. The success rate of the Shortcut Model policies in state and visual manipulation tasks achieved an average net increase of 40.34% after fine-tuning with ReinFlow at four or even one denoising step, whose performance is comparable to fine-tuned DDIM policies while saving computation time for an average of 23.20%.

- **[Streaming Flow Policy: Simplifying diffusion$/$flow-matching policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21851)**  `arXiv:2505.21851`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  Recent advances in diffusion$/$flow-matching policies have enabled imitation learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories. However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control. Project website:this https URL

- **[Mastering Agile Tasks with Limited Trials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21916)**  `arXiv:2505.21916`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yihang Hu, Pingyue Sheng, Shengjie Wang, Yang Gao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Embodied robots nowadays can already handle many real-world manipulation tasks. However, certain other real-world tasks (e.g., shooting a basketball into a hoop) are highly agile and require high execution precision, presenting additional challenges for methods primarily designed for quasi-static manipulation tasks. This leads to increased efforts in costly data collection, laborious reward design, or complex motion planning. Such tasks, however, are far less challenging for humans. Say a novice basketball player typically needs only $\sim$10 attempts to make their first successful shot, by roughly imitating a motion prior and then iteratively adjusting their motion based on the past outcomes. Inspired by this human learning paradigm, we propose the Adaptive Diffusion Action Plannin (ADAP) algorithm, a simple & scalable approach which iteratively refines its action plan by few real-world trials within a learned prior motion pattern, until reaching a specific goal. Experiments demonstrated that ADAP can learn and accomplish a wide range of goal-conditioned agile dynamic tasks with human-level precision and efficiency directly in real-world, such as throwing a basketball into the hoop in fewer than 10 trials.

- **[JEDI: Latent End-to-end Diffusion Mitigates Agent-Human Performance Asymmetry in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19698)**  `arXiv:2505.19698`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.RO`

  Recent advances in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) have achieved super-human level performance on the Atari100k benchmark, driven by reinforcement learning agents trained on powerful diffusion world models. However, we identify that the current aggregates mask a major performance asymmetry: MBRL agents dramatically outperform humans in some tasks despite drastically underperforming in others, with the former inflating the aggregate metrics. This is especially pronounced in pixel-based agents trained with diffusion world models. In this work, we address the pronounced asymmetry observed in pixel-based agents as an initial attempt to reverse the worrying upward trend observed in them. We address the problematic aggregates by delineating all tasks as Agent-Optimal or Human-Optimal and advocate for equal importance on metrics from both sets. Next, we hypothesize this pronounced asymmetry is due to the lack of temporally-structured latent space trained with the World Model objective in pixel-based methods. Lastly, to address this issue, we propose Joint Embedding DIffusion (JEDI), a novel latent diffusion world model trained end-to-end with the self-consistency objective. JEDI outperforms SOTA models in human-optimal tasks while staying competitive across the Atari100k benchmark, and runs 3 times faster with 43% lower memory than the latest pixel-based diffusion baseline. Overall, our work rethinks what it truly means to cross human-level performance in Atari100k.

- **[Latent Weight Diffusion: Generating reactive policies instead of trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14040)**  `arXiv:2410.14040`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.RO`

  With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and locomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost, namely, larger model size and slower inference. This is especially an issue for robotic tasks that require high control frequency. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular model for generating trajectories: fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. For these reasons, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to generate closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) for robotic tasks, rather than generating trajectories. Learning the behavior distribution through parameter space over trajectory space offers two key advantages: longer action horizons (fewer diffusion queries) & robustness to perturbations while retaining high performance; and a lower inference compute cost. To this end, we show that LWD has higher success rates than DP when the action horizon is longer and when stochastic perturbations exist in the environment. Furthermore, LWD achieves multitask performance comparable to DP while requiring just ~1/45th of the inference-time FLOPS

- **[Non-Markovian Discrete Diffusion with Causal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09767)**  `arXiv:2502.09767`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Yangtian Zhang, Sizhuang He, Daniel Levine, Lawrence Zhao, David Zhang, Syed A Rizvi, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discrete diffusion models offer a flexible, controllable approach to structured sequence generation, yet they still lag behind causal language models in expressive power. A key limitation lies in their reliance on the Markovian assumption, which restricts each step to condition only on the current state, leading to potential uncorrectable error accumulation. In this paper, we introduce CaDDi, a discrete diffusion model that conditions on the entire generative trajectory, thereby lifting the Markov constraint and allowing the model to revisit and improve past states. By unifying sequential (causal) and temporal (diffusion) reasoning in a single non-Markovian transformer, CaDDi also treats standard causal language models as a special case and permits the direct reuse of pretrained LLM weights with no architectural changes. Empirically, CaDDi outperforms state-of-the-art discrete diffusion baselines on natural-language benchmarks, substantially narrowing the remaining gap to large autoregressive transformers.

- **[Versatile Cardiovascular Signal Generation with a Unified Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22306)**  `arXiv:2505.22306`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cardiovascular signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG), electrocardiography (ECG), and blood pressure (BP) are inherently correlated and complementary, together reflecting the health of cardiovascular system. However, their joint utilization in real-time monitoring is severely limited by diverse acquisition challenges from noisy wearable recordings to burdened invasive procedures. Here we propose UniCardio, a multi-modal diffusion transformer that reconstructs low-quality signals and synthesizes unrecorded signals in a unified generative framework. Its key innovations include a specialized model architecture to manage the signal modalities involved in generation tasks and a continual learning paradigm to incorporate varying modality combinations. By exploiting the complementary nature of cardiovascular signals, UniCardio clearly outperforms recent task-specific baselines in signal denoising, imputation, and translation. The generated signals match the performance of ground-truth signals in detecting abnormal health conditions and estimating vital signs, even in unseen domains, while ensuring interpretability for human experts. These advantages position UniCardio as a promising avenue for advancing AI-assisted healthcare.

- **[SDPO: Importance-Sampled Direct Preference Optimization for Stable Diffusion Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21893)**  `arXiv:2505.21893`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Xiaomeng Yang, Zhiyu Tan, Junyan Wang, Zhijian Zhou, Hao Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Preference learning has become a central technique for aligning generative models with human expectations. Recently, it has been extended to diffusion models through methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, existing approaches such as Diffusion-DPO suffer from two key challenges: timestep-dependent instability, caused by a mismatch between the reverse and forward diffusion processes and by high gradient variance in early noisy timesteps, and off-policy bias arising from the mismatch between optimization and data collection policies. We begin by analyzing the reverse diffusion trajectory and observe that instability primarily occurs at early timesteps with low importance weights. To address these issues, we first propose DPO-C\&M, a practical strategy that improves stability by clipping and masking uninformative timesteps while partially mitigating off-policy bias. Building on this, we introduce SDPO (Importance-Sampled Direct Preference Optimization), a principled framework that incorporates importance sampling into the objective to fully correct for off-policy bias and emphasize informative updates during the diffusion process. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B, CogVideoX-5B, and Wan2.1-1.3B demonstrate that both methods outperform standard Diffusion-DPO, with SDPO achieving superior VBench scores, human preference alignment, and training robustness. These results highlight the importance of timestep-aware, distribution-corrected optimization in diffusion-based preference learning.

- **[Efficient Controllable Diffusion via Optimal Classifier Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21666)**  `arXiv:2505.21666`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The controllable generation of diffusion models aims to steer the model to generate samples that optimize some given objective functions. It is desirable for a variety of applications including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/sequence generation. Reinforcement Learning (RL) based fine-tuning of the base model is a popular approach but it can overfit the reward function while requiring significant resources. We frame controllable generation as a problem of finding a distribution that optimizes a KL-regularized objective function. We present SLCD -- Supervised Learning based Controllable Diffusion, which iteratively generates online data and trains a small classifier to guide the generation of the diffusion model. Similar to the standard classifier-guided diffusion, SLCD's key computation primitive is classification and does not involve any complex concepts from RL or control. Via a reduction to no-regret online learning analysis, we show that under KL divergence, the output from SLCD provably converges to the optimal solution of the KL-regularized objective. Further, we empirically demonstrate that SLCD can generate high quality samples with nearly the same inference time as the base model in both image generation with continuous diffusion and biological sequence generation with discrete diffusion.

- **[Pioneering 4-Bit FP Quantization for Diffusion Models: Mixup-Sign Quantization and Timestep-Aware Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21591)**  `arXiv:2505.21591`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Maosen Zhao, Pengtao Chen, Chong Yu, Yan Wen, Xudong Tan, Tao Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model quantization reduces the bit-width of weights and activations, improving memory efficiency and inference speed in diffusion models. However, achieving 4-bit quantization remains challenging. Existing methods, primarily based on integer quantization and post-training quantization fine-tuning, struggle with inconsistent performance. Inspired by the success of floating-point (FP) quantization in large language models, we explore low-bit FP quantization for diffusion models and identify key challenges: the failure of signed FP quantization to handle asymmetric activation distributions, the insufficient consideration of temporal complexity in the denoising process during fine-tuning, and the misalignment between fine-tuning loss and quantization error. To address these challenges, we propose the mixup-sign floating-point quantization (MSFP) framework, first introducing unsigned FP quantization in model quantization, along with timestep-aware LoRA (TALoRA) and denoising-factor loss alignment (DFA), which ensure precise and stable fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that we are the first to achieve superior performance in 4-bit FP quantization for diffusion models, outperforming existing PTQ fine-tuning methods in 4-bit INT quantization.

- **[Adjoint Sampling: Highly Scalable Diffusion Samplers via Adjoint Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11713)**  `arXiv:2504.11713`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Aaron Havens, Benjamin Kurt Miller, Bing Yan, Carles Domingo-Enrich, Anuroop Sriram, Brandon Wood, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Adjoint Sampling, a highly scalable and efficient algorithm for learning diffusion processes that sample from unnormalized densities, or energy functions. It is the first on-policy approach that allows significantly more gradient updates than the number of energy evaluations and model samples, allowing us to scale to much larger problem settings than previously explored by similar methods. Our framework is theoretically grounded in stochastic optimal control and shares the same theoretical guarantees as Adjoint Matching, being able to train without the need for corrective measures that push samples towards the target distribution. We show how to incorporate key symmetries, as well as periodic boundary conditions, for modeling molecules in both cartesian and torsional coordinates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on classical energy functions, and further scale up to neural network-based energy models where we perform amortized conformer generation across many molecular systems. To encourage further research in developing highly scalable sampling methods, we plan to open source these challenging benchmarks, where successful methods can directly impact progress in computational chemistry.

- **[ReQFlow: Rectified Quaternion Flow for Efficient and High-Quality Protein Backbone Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14637)**  `arXiv:2502.14637`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Angxiao Yue, Zichong Wang, Hongteng Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Protein backbone generation plays a central role in de novo protein design and is significant for many biological and medical applications. Although diffusion and flow-based generative models provide potential solutions to this challenging task, they often generate proteins with undesired designability and suffer computational inefficiency. In this study, we propose a novel rectified quaternion flow (ReQFlow) matching method for fast and high-quality protein backbone generation. In particular, our method generates a local translation and a 3D rotation from random noise for each residue in a protein chain, which represents each 3D rotation as a unit quaternion and constructs its flow by spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) in an exponential format. We train the model by quaternion flow (QFlow) matching with guaranteed numerical stability and rectify the QFlow model to accelerate its inference and improve the designability of generated protein backbones, leading to the proposed ReQFlow model. Experiments show that ReQFlow achieves on-par performance in protein backbone generation while requiring much fewer sampling steps and significantly less inference time (e.g., being 37x faster than RFDiffusion and 63x faster than Genie2 when generating a backbone of length 300), demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. The code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Path Planning for Masked Diffusion Model Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03540)**  `arXiv:2502.03540`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Fred Zhangzhi Peng, Zachary Bezemek, Sawan Patel, Jarrid Rector-Brooks, Sherwood Yao, Avishek Joey Bose, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Any order generation of discrete data using masked diffusion models (MDMs) offers a compelling alternative to traditional autoregressive models, especially in domains that lack a natural causal ordering of data. However, current popular MDMs depart from their successful continuous diffusion model counterparts with simplified masked inference wherein unmasked tokens cannot be iteratively refined -- even if there is a mistake. In this paper, we extract the full power of MDMs by introducing a novel inference sampling strategy termed Path Planning (P2) that decomposes each generation step into two sub-stages: planning and denoising. Under P2, the planner at every step selects appropriate tokens that are marked to be updated, which can then be sampled using the denoiser. We demonstrate that P2 generalizes all existing sampling strategies for MDMs and critically enhances generative quality through the new capability of refining and updating existing unmasked tokens. We theoretically prove that P2 establishes a (new) expanded evidence lower bound (ELBO) on the log marginal likelihood of data. We instantiate P2 with a family of planners including: 1.) Self-Planning, 2.) BERT-Planning, and 3.) Trained-Planning with a learned planner leading to SOTA generative performance for MDMs on a suite of domains. Specifically, solely using P2 inference, we observe relative improvements of 22% in protein sequence foldability, 8% in RNA sequence pLDDT, 4% in math reasoning, 68% in story generation (ROUGE score), and 33% in code generation for the challenging pass@1 metric.

- **[Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16349)**  `arXiv:2501.16349`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Junlan Chen, Pei Liu, Zihao Zhang, Hongyi Zhao, Yufei Ji, Ziyuan Pu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.

- **[Test-Time Alignment of Discrete Diffusion Models with Sequential Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22524)**  `arXiv:2505.22524`  `cs.LG`  
  _Chinmay Pani, Zijing Ou, Yingzhen Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discrete diffusion models have become highly effective across various domains. However, real-world applications often require the generative process to adhere to certain constraints but without task-specific fine-tuning. To this end, we propose a training-free method based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to sample from the reward-aligned target distribution at the test time. Our approach leverages twisted SMC with an approximate locally optimal proposal, obtained via a first-order Taylor expansion of the reward function. To address the challenge of ill-defined gradients in discrete spaces, we incorporate a Gumbel-Softmax relaxation, enabling efficient gradient-based approximation within the discrete generative framework. Empirical results on both synthetic datasets and image modelling validate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **[A Closer Look on Memorization in Tabular Diffusion Model: A Data-Centric Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22322)**  `arXiv:2505.22322`  `cs.LG`  
  _Zhengyu Fang, Zhimeng Jiang, Huiyuan Chen, Xiaoge Zhang, Kaiyu Tang, Xiao Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have shown strong performance in generating high-quality tabular data, but they carry privacy risks by reproducing exact training samples. While prior work focuses on dataset-level augmentation to reduce memorization, little is known about which individual samples contribute most. We present the first data-centric study of memorization dynamics in tabular diffusion models. We quantify memorization for each real sample based on how many generated samples are flagged as replicas, using a relative distance ratio. Our empirical analysis reveals a heavy-tailed distribution of memorization counts: a small subset of samples contributes disproportionately to leakage, confirmed via sample-removal experiments. To understand this, we divide real samples into top- and non-top-memorized groups and analyze their training-time behaviors. We track when each sample is first memorized and monitor per-epoch memorization intensity (AUC). Memorized samples are memorized slightly earlier and show stronger signals in early training. Based on these insights, we propose DynamicCut, a two-stage, model-agnostic mitigation method: (a) rank samples by epoch-wise intensity, (b) prune a tunable top fraction, and (c) retrain on the filtered dataset. Across multiple tabular datasets and models, DynamicCut reduces memorization with minimal impact on data diversity and downstream performance. It also complements augmentation-based defenses. Furthermore, DynamicCut enables cross-model transferability: high-ranked samples identified from one model (e.g., a diffusion model) are also effective for reducing memorization when removed from others, such as GANs and VAEs.

- **[Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Uncertainty-Guided Diffusional Subgoals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21750)**  `arXiv:2505.21750`  `cs.LG`  
  _Vivienne Huiling Wang, Tinghuai Wang, Joni Pajarinen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) learns to make decisions on multiple levels of temporal abstraction. A key challenge in HRL is that the low-level policy changes over time, making it difficult for the high-level policy to generate effective subgoals. To address this issue, the high-level policy must capture a complex subgoal distribution while also accounting for uncertainty in its estimates. We propose an approach that trains a conditional diffusion model regularized by a Gaussian Process (GP) prior to generate a complex variety of subgoals while leveraging principled GP uncertainty quantification. Building on this framework, we develop a strategy that selects subgoals from both the diffusion policy and GP's predictive mean. Our approach outperforms prior HRL methods in both sample efficiency and performance on challenging continuous control benchmarks.

  _Shutong Ding, Ke Hu, Shan Zhong, Haoyang Luo, Weinan Zhang, Jingya Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated the powerful exploration capabilities and multimodality of generative diffusion-based policies. While substantial progress has been made in offline RL and off-policy RL settings, integrating diffusion policies into on-policy frameworks like PPO remains underexplored. This gap is particularly significant given the widespread use of large-scale parallel GPU-accelerated simulators, such as IsaacLab, which are optimized for on-policy RL algorithms and enable rapid training of complex robotic tasks. A key challenge lies in computing state-action log-likelihoods under diffusion policies, which is straightforward for Gaussian policies but intractable for flow-based models due to irreversible forward-reverse processes and discretization errors (e.g., Euler-Maruyama approximations). To bridge this gap, we propose GenPO, a generative policy optimization framework that leverages exact diffusion inversion to construct invertible action mappings. GenPO introduces a novel doubled dummy action mechanism that enables invertibility via alternating updates, resolving log-likelihood computation barriers. Furthermore, we also use the action log-likelihood for unbiased entropy and KL divergence estimation, enabling KL-adaptive learning rates and entropy regularization in on-policy updates. Extensive experiments on eight IsaacLab benchmarks, including legged locomotion (Ant, Humanoid, Anymal-D, Unitree H1, Go2), dexterous manipulation (Shadow Hand), aerial control (Quadcopter), and robotic arm tasks (Franka), demonstrate GenPO's superiority over existing RL baselines. Notably, GenPO is the first method to successfully integrate diffusion policies into on-policy RL, unlocking their potential for large-scale parallelized training and real-world robotic deployment.

- **[Outsourced diffusion sampling: Efficient posterior inference in latent spaces of generative models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06999)**  `arXiv:2502.06999`  `cs.LG`  
  _Siddarth Venkatraman, Mohsin Hasan, Minsu Kim, Luca Scimeca, Marcin Sendera, Yoshua Bengio, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Any well-behaved generative model over a variable $\mathbf{x}$ can be expressed as a deterministic transformation of an exogenous ('outsourced') Gaussian noise variable $\mathbf{z}$: $\mathbf{x}=f_\theta(\mathbf{z})$. In such a model (\eg, a VAE, GAN, or continuous-time flow-based model), sampling of the target variable $\mathbf{x} \sim p_\theta(\mathbf{x})$ is straightforward, but sampling from a posterior distribution of the form $p(\mathbf{x}\mid\mathbf{y}) \propto p_\theta(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where $r$ is a constraint function depending on an auxiliary variable $\mathbf{y}$, is generally intractable. We propose to amortize the cost of sampling from such posterior distributions with diffusion models that sample a distribution in the noise space ($\mathbf{z}$). These diffusion samplers are trained by reinforcement learning algorithms to enforce that the transformed samples $f_\theta(\mathbf{z})$ are distributed according to the posterior in the data space ($\mathbf{x}$). For many models and constraints, the posterior in noise space is smoother than in data space, making it more suitable for amortized inference. Our method enables conditional sampling under unconditional GAN, (H)VAE, and flow-based priors, comparing favorably with other inference methods. We demonstrate the proposed outsourced diffusion sampling in several experiments with large pretrained prior models: conditional image generation, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and protein structure generation.

  _Rafa≈Ç Karczewski, Markus Heinonen, Vikas Garg_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, capable of producing high-quality images by mapping noise to a data distribution. However, recent findings suggest that image likelihood does not align with perceptual quality: high-likelihood samples tend to be smooth, while lower-likelihood ones are more detailed. Controlling sample density is thus crucial for balancing realism and detail. In this paper, we analyze an existing technique, Prior Guidance, which scales the latent code to influence image detail. We introduce score alignment, a condition that explains why this method works and show that it can be tractably checked for any continuous normalizing flow model. We then propose Density Guidance, a principled modification of the generative ODE that enables exact log-density control during sampling. Finally, we extend Density Guidance to stochastic sampling, ensuring precise log-density control while allowing controlled variation in structure or fine details. Our experiments demonstrate that these techniques provide fine-grained control over image detail without compromising sample quality. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Diffusion policies have achieved superior performance in imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their rich expressiveness. However, the conventional diffusion training procedure requires samples from target distribution, which is impossible in online RL since we cannot sample from the optimal policy. Backpropagating policy gradient through the diffusion process incurs huge computational costs and instability, thus being expensive and not scalable. To enable efficient training of diffusion policies in online RL, we generalize the conventional denoising score matching by reweighting the loss function. The resulting Reweighted Score Matching (RSM) preserves the optimal solution and low computational cost of denoising score matching, while eliminating the need to sample from the target distribution and allowing learning to optimize value functions. We introduce two tractable reweighted loss functions to solve two commonly used policy optimization problems, policy mirror descent and max-entropy policy, resulting in two practical algorithms named Diffusion Policy Mirror Descent (DPMD) and Soft Diffusion Actor-Critic (SDAC). We conducted comprehensive comparisons on MuJoCo benchmarks. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform recent diffusion-policy online RLs on most tasks, and the DPMD improves more than 120% over soft actor-critic on Humanoid and Ant.

  Diffusion models for continuous data gained widespread adoption owing to their high quality generation and control mechanisms. However, controllable diffusion on discrete data faces challenges given that continuous guidance methods do not directly apply to discrete diffusion. Here, we provide a straightforward derivation of classifier-free and classifier-based guidance for discrete diffusion, as well as a new class of diffusion models that leverage uniform noise and that are more guidable because they can continuously edit their outputs. We improve the quality of these models with a novel continuous-time variational lower bound that yields state-of-the-art performance, especially in settings involving guidance or fast generation. Empirically, we demonstrate that our guidance mechanisms combined with uniform noise diffusion improve controllable generation relative to autoregressive and diffusion baselines on several discrete data domains, including genomic sequences, small molecule design, and discretized image generation.

  Schrodinger Bridges (SBs) are diffusion processes that steer, in finite time, a given initial distribution to another final one while minimizing a suitable cost functional. Although various methods for computing SBs have recently been proposed in the literature, most of these approaches require computationally expensive training schemes, even for solving low-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose an analytic parametrization of a set of feasible policies for steering the distribution of a dynamical system from one Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to another. Instead of relying on standard non-convex optimization techniques, the optimal policy within the set can be approximated as the solution of a low-dimensional linear program whose dimension scales linearly with the number of components in each mixture. The proposed method generalizes naturally to more general classes of dynamical systems, such as controllable linear time-varying systems, enabling efficient solutions to multi-marginal momentum SB between GMMs, a challenging distribution interpolation problem. We showcase the potential of this approach in low-to-moderate dimensional problems such as image-to-image translation in the latent space of an autoencoder, learning of cellular dynamics using multi-marginal momentum SB problems, and various other examples. We also test our approach on an Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) benchmark problem and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cases where the boundary distributions are mixture models while requiring virtually no training.

  Motion generation is a cornerstone of computer graphics, animation, gaming, and robotics, enabling the creation of realistic and varied character movements. A significant limitation of existing methods is their reliance on specific skeletal structures, which restricts their versatility across different characters. To overcome this, we introduce UniMoGen, a novel UNet-based diffusion model designed for skeleton-agnostic motion generation. UniMoGen can be trained on motion data from diverse characters, such as humans and animals, without the need for a predefined maximum number of joints. By dynamically processing only the necessary joints for each character, our model achieves both skeleton agnosticism and computational efficiency. Key features of UniMoGen include controllability via style and trajectory inputs, and the ability to continue motions from past frames. We demonstrate UniMoGen's effectiveness on the 100style dataset, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse character motion generation. Furthermore, when trained on both the 100style and LAFAN1 datasets, which use different skeletons, UniMoGen achieves high performance and improved efficiency across both skeletons. These results highlight UniMoGen's potential to advance motion generation by providing a flexible, efficient, and controllable solution for a wide range of character animations.

  We answer the question in the title, showing that adversarial training (AT) for diffusion models (DMs) fundamentally differs from classifiers: while AT in classifiers enforces output invariance, AT in DMs requires equivariance to keep the diffusion process aligned with the data distribution. AT is a way to enforce smoothness in the diffusion flow, improving robustness to outliers and corrupted data. Unlike prior art, our method makes no assumptions about the noise model and integrates seamlessly into diffusion training by adding random noise, similar to randomized smoothing, or adversarial noise, akin to AT. This enables intrinsic capabilities such as handling noisy data, dealing with extreme variability such as outliers, preventing memorization, and improving robustness. We rigorously evaluate our approach with proof-of-concept datasets with known distributions in low- and high-dimensional space, thereby taking a perfect measure of errors; we further evaluate on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10, CelebA and LSUN Bedroom, showing strong performance under severe noise, data corruption, and iterative adversarial attacks.

  Synthetically augmenting training datasets with diffusion models has been an effective strategy for improving generalization of image classifiers. However, existing techniques struggle to ensure the diversity of generation and increase the size of the data by up to 10-30x to improve the in-distribution performance. In this work, we show that synthetically augmenting part of the data that is not learned early in training outperforms augmenting the entire dataset. By analyzing a two-layer CNN, we prove that this strategy improves generalization by promoting homogeneity in feature learning speed without amplifying noise. Our extensive experiments show that by augmenting only 30%-40% of the data, our method boosts the performance by up to 2.8% in a variety of scenarios, including training ResNet, ViT and DenseNet on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, with a range of optimizers including SGD and SAM. Notably, our method applied with SGD outperforms the SOTA optimizer, SAM, on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet. It can also easily stack with existing weak and strong augmentation strategies to further boost the performance.

  AI-based motion capture is an emerging technology that offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional motion capture systems. However, current AI motion capture methods rely entirely on observed video sequences, similar to conventional motion capture. This means that all human actions must be predefined, and movements outside the observed sequences are not possible. To address this limitation, we aim to apply AI motion capture to virtual humans, where flexible actions beyond the observed sequences are required. We assume that while many action fragments exist in the training data, the transitions between them may be missing. To bridge these gaps, we propose a diffusion-model-based action completion technique that generates complementary human motion sequences, ensuring smooth and continuous movements. By introducing a gate module and a position-time embedding module, our approach achieves competitive results on the Human3.6M dataset. Our experimental results show that (1) MDC-Net outperforms existing methods in ADE, FDE, and MMADE but is slightly less accurate in MMFDE, (2) MDC-Net has a smaller model size (16.84M) compared to HumanMAC (28.40M), and (3) MDC-Net generates more natural and coherent motion sequences. Additionally, we propose a method for extracting sensor data, including acceleration and angular velocity, from human motion sequences.

  Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) achieve high-quality generation but are sensitive to imperfect conditioning, which causes semantic drift and temporal incoherence on noisy, web-scale video-text datasets. We introduce CAT-LVDM, the first corruption-aware training framework for LVDMs that improves robustness through structured, data-aligned noise injection. Our method includes Batch-Centered Noise Injection (BCNI), which perturbs embeddings along intra-batch semantic directions to preserve temporal consistency. BCNI is especially effective on caption-rich datasets like WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and MSVD. We also propose Spectrum-Aware Contextual Noise (SACN), which injects noise along dominant spectral directions to improve low-frequency smoothness, showing strong results on UCF-101. On average, BCNI reduces FVD by 31.9% across WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and MSVD, while SACN yields a 12.3% improvement on UCF-101. Ablation studies confirm the benefit of low-rank, data-aligned noise. Our theoretical analysis further explains how such perturbations tighten entropy, Wasserstein, score-drift, mixing-time, and generalization bounds. CAT-LVDM establishes a principled, scalable training approach for robust video diffusion under multimodal noise. Code and models:this https URL

  Inverse problems (IPs) involve reconstructing signals from noisy observations. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving IPs, achieving remarkable reconstruction performance. However, existing DM-based methods frequently encounter issues such as heavy computational demands and suboptimal convergence. In this work, building upon the idea of the recent work DMPlug, we propose two novel methods, DMILO and DMILO-PGD, to address these challenges. Our first method, DMILO, employs intermediate layer optimization (ILO) to alleviate the memory burden inherent in DMPlug. Additionally, by introducing sparse deviations, we expand the range of DMs, enabling the exploration of underlying signals that may lie outside the range of the diffusion model. We further propose DMILO-PGD, which integrates ILO with projected gradient descent (PGD), thereby reducing the risk of suboptimal convergence. We provide an intuitive theoretical analysis of our approaches under appropriate conditions and validate their superiority through extensive experiments on diverse image datasets, encompassing both linear and nonlinear IPs. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of DMILO and DMILO-PGD in addressing common challenges in DM-based IP solvers.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models. Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.

  We investigate what kind of images lie in the high-density regions of diffusion models. We introduce a theoretical mode-tracking process capable of pinpointing the exact mode of the denoising distribution, and we propose a practical high-density sampler that consistently generates images of higher likelihood than usual samplers. Our empirical findings reveal the existence of significantly higher likelihood samples that typical samplers do not produce, often manifesting as cartoon-like drawings or blurry images depending on the noise level. Curiously, these patterns emerge in datasets devoid of such examples. We also present a novel approach to track sample likelihoods in diffusion SDEs, which remarkably incurs no additional computational cost. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Diffusion Bridges enable transitions between arbitrary distributions, with the Unified Diffusion Bridge (UniDB) framework achieving high-fidelity image generation via a Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) formulation. However, UniDB's reliance on iterative Euler sampling methods results in slow, computationally expensive inference, while existing acceleration techniques for diffusion or diffusion bridge models fail to address its unique challenges: missing terminal mean constraints and SOC-specific penalty coefficients in its SDEs. We present UniDB++, a training-free sampling algorithm that significantly improves upon these limitations. The method's key advancement comes from deriving exact closed-form solutions for UniDB's reverse-time SDEs, effectively reducing the error accumulation inherent in Euler approximations and enabling high-quality generation with up to 20$\times$ fewer sampling steps. This method is further complemented by replacing conventional noise prediction with a more stable data prediction model, along with an SDE-Corrector mechanism that maintains perceptual quality for low-step regimes (5-10 steps). Additionally, we demonstrate that UniDB++ aligns with existing diffusion bridge acceleration methods by evaluating their update rules, and UniDB++ can recover DBIMs as special cases under some theoretical conditions. Experiments demonstrate UniDB++'s state-of-the-art performance in image restoration tasks, outperforming Euler-based methods in fidelity and speed while reducing inference time significantly. This work bridges the gap between theoretical generality and practical efficiency in SOC-driven diffusion bridge models. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  The diffusion models are widely used for image and video generation, but their iterative generation process is slow and expansive. While existing distillation approaches have demonstrated the potential for one-step generation in the image domain, they still suffer from significant quality degradation. In this work, we propose Adversarial Post-Training (APT) against real data following diffusion pre-training for one-step video generation. To improve the training stability and quality, we introduce several improvements to the model architecture and training procedures, along with an approximated R1 regularization objective. Empirically, our experiments show that our adversarial post-trained model, Seaweed-APT, can generate 2-second, 1280x720, 24fps videos in real time using a single forward evaluation step. Additionally, our model is capable of generating 1024px images in a single step, achieving quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

  Recent advances in audio-driven talking head generation have achieved impressive results in lip synchronization and emotional expression. However, they largely overlook the crucial task of facial attribute editing. This capability is crucial for achieving deep personalization and expanding the range of practical applications, including user-tailored digital avatars, engaging online education content, and brand-specific digital customer service. In these key domains, the flexible adjustment of visual attributes-such as hairstyle, accessories, and subtle facial features is essential for aligning with user preferences, reflecting diverse brand identities, and adapting to varying contextual demands. In this paper, we present FaceEditTalker, a unified framework that enables controllable facial attribute manipulation while generating high-quality, audio-synchronized talking head videos. Our method consists of two key components: an image feature space editing module, which extracts semantic and detail features and allows flexible control over attributes like expression, hairstyle, and accessories; and an audio-driven video generation module, which fuses these edited features with audio-guided facial landmarks to drive a diffusion-based generator. This design ensures temporal coherence, visual fidelity, and identity preservation across frames. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in lip-sync accuracy, video quality, and attribute controllability.

  Recent years have seen rapid advances in AI-driven image generation. Early diffusion models emphasized perceptual quality, while newer multimodal models like GPT-4o-image integrate high-level reasoning, improving semantic understanding and structural composition. Scientific illustration generation exemplifies this evolution: unlike general image synthesis, it demands accurate interpretation of technical content and transformation of abstract ideas into clear, standardized visuals. This task is significantly more knowledge-intensive and laborious, often requiring hours of manual work and specialized tools. Automating it in a controllable, intelligent manner would provide substantial practical value. Yet, no benchmark currently exists to evaluate AI on this front. To fill this gap, we introduce SridBench, the first benchmark for scientific figure generation. It comprises 1,120 instances curated from leading scientific papers across 13 natural and computer science disciplines, collected via human experts and MLLMs. Each sample is evaluated along six dimensions, including semantic fidelity and structural accuracy. Experimental results reveal that even top-tier models like GPT-4o-image lag behind human performance, with common issues in text/visual clarity and scientific correctness. These findings highlight the need for more advanced reasoning-driven visual generation capabilities.

  Recent approaches on 3D camera control in video diffusion models (VDMs) often create anchor videos to guide diffusion models as a structured prior by rendering from estimated point clouds following annotated camera trajectories. However, errors inherent in point cloud estimation often lead to inaccurate anchor videos. Moreover, the requirement for extensive camera trajectory annotations further increases resource demands. To address these limitations, we introduce EPiC, an efficient and precise camera control learning framework that automatically constructs high-quality anchor videos without expensive camera trajectory annotations. Concretely, we create highly precise anchor videos for training by masking source videos based on first-frame visibility. This approach ensures high alignment, eliminates the need for camera trajectory annotations, and thus can be readily applied to any in-the-wild video to generate image-to-video (I2V) training pairs. Furthermore, we introduce Anchor-ControlNet, a lightweight conditioning module that integrates anchor video guidance in visible regions to pretrained VDMs, with less than 1% of backbone model parameters. By combining the proposed anchor video data and ControlNet module, EPiC achieves efficient training with substantially fewer parameters, training steps, and less data, without requiring modifications to the diffusion model backbone typically needed to mitigate rendering misalignments. Although being trained on masking-based anchor videos, our method generalizes robustly to anchor videos made with point clouds during inference, enabling precise 3D-informed camera control. EPiC achieves SOTA performance on RealEstate10K and MiraData for I2V camera control task, demonstrating precise and robust camera control ability both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, EPiC also exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to video-to-video scenarios.

  Recent advances in diffusion based editing models have enabled realistic camera simulation and image-based bokeh, but video bokeh remains largely unexplored. Existing video editing models cannot explicitly control focus planes or adjust bokeh intensity, limiting their applicability for controllable optical effects. Moreover, naively extending image-based bokeh methods to video often results in temporal flickering and unsatisfactory edge blur transitions due to the lack of temporal modeling and generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel one-step video bokeh framework that converts arbitrary input videos into temporally coherent, depth-aware bokeh effects. Our method leverages a multi-plane image (MPI) representation constructed through a progressively widening depth sampling function, providing explicit geometric guidance for depth-dependent blur synthesis. By conditioning a single-step video diffusion model on MPI layers and utilizing the strong 3D priors from pre-trained models such as Stable Video Diffusion, our approach achieves realistic and consistent bokeh effects across diverse scenes. Additionally, we introduce a progressive training strategy to enhance temporal consistency, depth robustness, and detail preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-quality, controllable bokeh effects and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple evaluation benchmarks.

  Diffusion models have recently motivated great success in many generation tasks like object removal. Nevertheless, existing image decomposition methods struggle to disentangle semi-transparent or transparent layer occlusions due to mask prior dependencies, static object assumptions, and the lack of datasets. In this paper, we delve into a novel task: Layer-Wise Decomposition of Alpha-Composited Images, aiming to recover constituent layers from single overlapped images under the condition of semi-transparent/transparent alpha layer non-linear occlusion. To address challenges in layer ambiguity, generalization, and data scarcity, we first introduce AlphaBlend, the first large-scale and high-quality dataset for transparent and semi-transparent layer decomposition, supporting six real-world subtasks (e.g., translucent flare removal, semi-transparent cell decomposition, glassware decomposition). Building on this dataset, we present DiffDecompose, a diffusion Transformer-based framework that learns the posterior over possible layer decompositions conditioned on the input image, semantic prompts, and blending type. Rather than regressing alpha mattes directly, DiffDecompose performs In-Context Decomposition, enabling the model to predict one or multiple layers without per-layer supervision, and introduces Layer Position Encoding Cloning to maintain pixel-level correspondence across layers. Extensive experiments on the proposed AlphaBlend dataset and public LOGO dataset verify the effectiveness of DiffDecompose. The code and dataset will be available upon paper acceptance.

  The goal of point cloud assembly is to reconstruct a complete 3D shape by aligning multiple point cloud pieces. This work presents a novel equivariant solver for assembly tasks based on flow matching models. We first theoretically show that the key to learning equivariant distributions via flow matching is to learn related vector fields. Based on this result, we propose an assembly model, called equivariant diffusion assembly (Eda), which learns related vector fields conditioned on the input pieces. We further construct an equivariant path for Eda, which guarantees high data efficiency of the training process. Our numerical results show that Eda is highly competitive on practical datasets, and it can even handle the challenging situation where the input pieces are non-overlapped.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress in combining visual comprehension with language generation. Despite this success, the training data of LVLMs still suffers from Long-Tail (LT) problems, where the data distribution is highly imbalanced. Previous works have mainly focused on traditional VLM architectures, i.e., CLIP or ViT, and specific tasks such as recognition and classification. Nevertheless, the exploration of LVLM (e.g. LLaVA) and more general tasks (e.g. Visual Question Answering and Visual Reasoning) remains under-explored. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the LT issues in LVLMs and identify two core causes: the overrepresentation of head concepts and the underrepresentation of tail concepts. Based on the above observation, we propose an $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{R}$efinement Framework ($\textbf{ADR}$), which consists of two stages: $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{R}$ebalancing ($\textbf{DR}$) and $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{S}$ynthesis ($\textbf{DS}$). In the DR stage, we adaptively rebalance the redundant data based on entity distributions, while in the DS stage, we leverage Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and scarce images to supplement underrepresented portions. Through comprehensive evaluations across eleven benchmarks, our proposed ADR effectively mitigates the long-tail problem in the training data, improving the average performance of LLaVA 1.5 relatively by 4.36%, without increasing the training data volume.

  Leveraging recent diffusion models, LiDAR-based large-scale 3D scene generation has achieved great success. While recent voxel-based approaches can generate both geometric structures and semantic labels, existing range-view methods are limited to producing unlabeled LiDAR scenes. Relying on pretrained segmentation models to predict the semantic maps often results in suboptimal cross-modal consistency. To address this limitation while preserving the advantages of range-view representations, such as computational efficiency and simplified network design, we propose Spiral, a novel range-view LiDAR diffusion model that simultaneously generates depth, reflectance images, and semantic maps. Furthermore, we introduce novel semantic-aware metrics to evaluate the quality of the generated labeled range-view data. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that Spiral achieves state-of-the-art performance with the smallest parameter size, outperforming two-step methods that combine the generative and segmentation models. Additionally, we validate that range images generated by Spiral can be effectively used for synthetic data augmentation in the downstream segmentation training, significantly reducing the labeling effort on LiDAR data.

  Object removal requires eliminating not only the target object but also its effects, such as shadows and reflections. However, diffusion-based inpainting methods often produce artifacts, hallucinate content, alter background, and struggle to remove object effects accurately. To address this challenge, we introduce a new dataset for OBject-Effect Removal, named OBER, which provides paired images with and without object effects, along with precise masks for both objects and their associated visual artifacts. The dataset comprises high-quality captured and simulated data, covering diverse object categories and complex multi-object scenes. Building on OBER, we propose a novel framework, ObjectClear, which incorporates an object-effect attention mechanism to guide the model toward the foreground removal regions by learning attention masks, effectively decoupling foreground removal from background reconstruction. Furthermore, the predicted attention map enables an attention-guided fusion strategy during inference, greatly preserving background details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ObjectClear outperforms existing methods, achieving improved object-effect removal quality and background fidelity, especially in complex scenarios.

  Recent advances in diffusion models have led to impressive image generation capabilities, but aligning these models with human preferences remains challenging. Reward-based fine-tuning using models trained on human feedback improves alignment but often harms diversity, producing less varied outputs. In this work, we address this trade-off with two contributions. First, we introduce \textit{combined generation}, a novel sampling strategy that applies a reward-tuned diffusion model only in the later stages of the generation process, while preserving the base model for earlier steps. This approach mitigates early-stage overfitting and helps retain global structure and diversity. Second, we propose \textit{ImageReFL}, a fine-tuning method that improves image diversity with minimal loss in quality by training on real images and incorporating multiple regularizers, including diffusion and ReFL losses. Our approach outperforms conventional reward tuning methods on standard quality and diversity metrics. A user study further confirms that our method better balances human preference alignment and visual diversity. The source code can be found atthis https URL.

  Generating high-quality, multi-layer transparent images from text prompts can unlock a new level of creative control, allowing users to edit each layer as effortlessly as editing text outputs from LLMs. However, the development of multi-layer generative models lags behind that of conventional text-to-image models due to the absence of a large, high-quality corpus of multi-layer transparent data. In this paper, we address this fundamental challenge by: (i) releasing the first open, ultra-high-fidelity PrismLayers (PrismLayersPro) dataset of 200K (20K) multilayer transparent images with accurate alpha mattes, (ii) introducing a trainingfree synthesis pipeline that generates such data on demand using off-the-shelf diffusion models, and (iii) delivering a strong, open-source multi-layer generation model, ART+, which matches the aesthetics of modern text-to-image generation models. The key technical contributions include: LayerFLUX, which excels at generating high-quality single transparent layers with accurate alpha mattes, and MultiLayerFLUX, which composes multiple LayerFLUX outputs into complete images, guided by human-annotated semantic layout. To ensure higher quality, we apply a rigorous filtering stage to remove artifacts and semantic mismatches, followed by human selection. Fine-tuning the state-of-the-art ART model on our synthetic PrismLayersPro yields ART+, which outperforms the original ART in 60% of head-to-head user study comparisons and even matches the visual quality of images generated by the FLUX.1-[dev] model. We anticipate that our work will establish a solid dataset foundation for the multi-layer transparent image generation task, enabling research and applications that require precise, editable, and visually compelling layered imagery.

  Diffusion models have recently demonstrated exceptional performance in image generation task. However, existing image generation methods still significantly suffer from the dilemma of image reasoning, especially in logic-centered image generation tasks. Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) in LLMs, we propose SRRL, a self-reflective RL algorithm for diffusion models to achieve reasoning generation of logical images by performing reflection and iteration across generation trajectories. The intermediate samples in the denoising process carry noise, making accurate reward evaluation difficult. To address this challenge, SRRL treats the entire denoising trajectory as a CoT step with multi-round reflective denoising process and introduces condition guided forward process, which allows for reflective iteration between CoT steps. Through SRRL-based iterative diffusion training, we introduce image reasoning through CoT into generation tasks adhering to physical laws and unconventional physical phenomena for the first time. Notably, experimental results of case study exhibit that the superior performance of our SRRL algorithm even compared with GPT-4o. The project page isthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  World models have recently become promising tools for predicting realistic visuals based on actions in complex environments. However, their reliance on a short sequence of observations causes them to quickly lose track of context. As a result, visual consistency breaks down after just a few steps, and generated scenes no longer reflect information seen earlier. This limitation of the state-of-the-art diffusion-based world models comes from their lack of a lasting environment state. To address this problem, we introduce StateSpaceDiffuser, where a diffusion model is enabled to perform on long-context tasks by integrating a sequence representation from a state-space model (Mamba), representing the entire interaction history. This design restores long-term memory without sacrificing the high-fidelity synthesis of diffusion models. To rigorously measure temporal consistency, we develop an evaluation protocol that probes a model's ability to reinstantiate seen content in extended rollouts. Comprehensive experiments show that StateSpaceDiffuser significantly outperforms a strong diffusion-only baseline, maintaining a coherent visual context for an order of magnitude more steps. It delivers consistent views in both a 2D maze navigation and a complex 3D environment. These results establish that bringing state-space representations into diffusion models is highly effective in demonstrating both visual details and long-term memory.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion transformers (DiT) have demonstrated exceptional performance in video generation. However, their large number of parameters and high computational complexity limit their deployment on edge devices. Quantization can reduce storage requirements and accelerate inference by lowering the bit-width of model parameters. Yet, existing quantization methods for image generation models do not generalize well to video generation tasks. We identify two primary challenges: the loss of information during quantization and the misalignment between optimization objectives and the unique requirements of video generation. To address these challenges, we present Q-VDiT, a quantization framework specifically designed for video DiT models. From the quantization perspective, we propose the Token-aware Quantization Estimator (TQE), which compensates for quantization errors in both the token and feature dimensions. From the optimization perspective, we introduce Temporal Maintenance Distillation (TMD), which preserves the spatiotemporal correlations between frames and enables the optimization of each frame with respect to the overall video context. Our W3A6 Q-VDiT achieves a scene consistency of 23.40, setting a new benchmark and outperforming current state-of-the-art quantization methods by 1.9$\times$. Code will be available atthis https URL.

  _Jinhong Ni, Chang-Bin Zhang, Qiang Zhang, Jing Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent prosperity of text-to-image diffusion models, e.g. Stable Diffusion, has stimulated research to adapt them to 360-degree panorama generation. Prior work has demonstrated the feasibility of using conventional low-rank adaptation techniques on pre-trained diffusion models to generate panoramic images. However, the substantial domain gap between perspective and panoramic images raises questions about the underlying mechanisms enabling this empirical success. We hypothesize and examine that the trainable counterparts exhibit distinct behaviors when fine-tuned on panoramic data, and such an adaptation conceals some intrinsic mechanism to leverage the prior knowledge within the pre-trained diffusion models. Our analysis reveals the following: 1) the query and key matrices in the attention modules are responsible for common information that can be shared between the panoramic and perspective domains, thus are less relevant to panorama generation; and 2) the value and output weight matrices specialize in adapting pre-trained knowledge to the panoramic domain, playing a more critical role during fine-tuning for panorama generation. We empirically verify these insights by introducing a simple framework called UniPano, with the objective of establishing an elegant baseline for future research. UniPano not only outperforms existing methods but also significantly reduces memory usage and training time compared to prior dual-branch approaches, making it scalable for end-to-end panorama generation with higher resolution. The code will be released.

  _Woonho Ko, Jin Bok Park, Il Yong Chun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing long-term video prediction methods often rely on an autoregressive video prediction mechanism. However, this approach suffers from error propagation, particularly in distant future frames. To address this limitation, this paper proposes the first AutoRegression-Free (ARFree) video prediction framework using diffusion models. Different from an autoregressive video prediction mechanism, ARFree directly predicts any future frame tuples from the context frame tuple. The proposed ARFree consists of two key components: 1) a motion prediction module that predicts a future motion using motion feature extracted from the context frame tuple; 2) a training method that improves motion continuity and contextual consistency between adjacent future frame tuples. Our experiments with two benchmark datasets show that the proposed ARFree video prediction framework outperforms several state-of-the-art video prediction methods.

  Panoramic video generation enables immersive 360¬∞ content creation, valuable in applications that demand scene-consistent world exploration. However, existing panoramic video generation models struggle to leverage pre-trained generative priors from conventional text-to-video models for high-quality and diverse panoramic videos generation, due to limited dataset scale and the gap in spatial feature representations. In this paper, we introduce PanoWan to effectively lift pre-trained text-to-video models to the panoramic domain, equipped with minimal modules. PanoWan employs latitude-aware sampling to avoid latitudinal distortion, while its rotated semantic denoising and padded pixel-wise decoding ensure seamless transitions at longitude boundaries. To provide sufficient panoramic videos for learning these lifted representations, we contribute PanoVid, a high-quality panoramic video dataset with captions and diverse scenarios. Consequently, PanoWan achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoramic video generation and demonstrates robustness for zero-shot downstream tasks.

  _Zijing Hu, Fengda Zhang, Kun Kuang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The practical applications of diffusion models have been limited by the misalignment between generated images and corresponding text prompts. Recent studies have introduced direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance the alignment of these models. However, the effectiveness of DPO is constrained by the issue of visual inconsistency, where the significant visual disparity between well-aligned and poorly-aligned images prevents diffusion models from identifying which factors contribute positively to alignment during fine-tuning. To address this issue, this paper introduces D-Fusion, a method to construct DPO-trainable visually consistent samples. On one hand, by performing mask-guided self-attention fusion, the resulting images are not only well-aligned, but also visually consistent with given poorly-aligned images. On the other hand, D-Fusion can retain the denoising trajectories of the resulting images, which are essential for DPO training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of D-Fusion in improving prompt-image alignment when applied to different reinforcement learning algorithms.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Document dewarping aims to rectify deformations in photographic document images, thus improving text readability, which has attracted much attention and made great progress, but it is still challenging to preserve document structures. Given recent advances in diffusion models, it is natural for us to consider their potential applicability to document dewarping. However, it is far from straightforward to adopt diffusion models in document dewarping due to their unfaithful control on highly complex document images (e.g., 2000$\times$3000 resolution). In this paper, we propose DvD, the first generative model to tackle document \textbf{D}ewarping \textbf{v}ia a \textbf{D}iffusion framework. To be specific, DvD introduces a coordinate-level denoising instead of typical pixel-level denoising, generating a mapping for deformation rectification. In addition, we further propose a time-variant condition refinement mechanism to enhance the preservation of document structures. In experiments, we find that current document dewarping benchmarks can not evaluate dewarping models comprehensively. To this end, we present AnyPhotoDoc6300, a rigorously designed large-scale document dewarping benchmark comprising 6,300 real image pairs across three distinct domains, enabling fine-grained evaluation of dewarping models. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DvD can achieve state-of-the-art performance with acceptable computational efficiency on multiple metrics across various benchmarks including DocUNet, DIR300, and AnyPhotoDoc6300. The new benchmark and code will be publicly available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made remarkable advancements in generative modeling; however, they face a trade-off between inference speed and image quality, posing challenges for efficient deployment. Existing distilled T2I models can generate high-fidelity images with fewer sampling steps, but often struggle with diversity and quality, especially in one-step models. From our analysis, we observe redundant computations in the UNet encoders. Our findings suggest that, for T2I diffusion models, decoders are more adept at capturing richer and more explicit semantic information, while encoders can be effectively shared across decoders from diverse time steps. Based on these observations, we introduce the first Time-independent Unified Encoder TiUE for the student model UNet architecture, which is a loop-free image generation approach for distilling T2I diffusion models. Using a one-pass scheme, TiUE shares encoder features across multiple decoder time steps, enabling parallel sampling and significantly reducing inference time complexity. In addition, we incorporate a KL divergence term to regularize noise prediction, which enhances the perceptual realism and diversity of the generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that TiUE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including LCM, SD-Turbo, and SwiftBrushv2, producing more diverse and realistic results while maintaining the computational efficiency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personalized image generation aims to integrate user-provided concepts into text-to-image models, enabling the generation of customized content based on a given prompt. Recent zero-shot approaches, particularly those leveraging diffusion transformers, incorporate reference image information through multi-modal attention mechanism. This integration allows the generated output to be influenced by both the textual prior from the prompt and the visual prior from the reference image. However, we observe that when the prompt and reference image are misaligned, the generated results exhibit a stronger bias toward the textual prior, leading to a significant loss of reference content. To address this issue, we propose AlignGen, a Cross-Modality Prior Alignment mechanism that enhances personalized image generation by: 1) introducing a learnable token to bridge the gap between the textual and visual priors, 2) incorporating a robust training strategy to ensure proper prior alignment, and 3) employing a selective cross-modal attention mask within the multi-modal attention mechanism to further align the priors. Experimental results demonstrate that AlignGen outperforms existing zero-shot methods and even surpasses popular test-time optimization approaches.

  Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has been widely used in agricultural applications for non-destructive estimation of plant nutrient composition and precise determination of nutritional elements in samples. Recently, 3D reconstruction methods have been used to create implicit neural representations of HSI scenes, which can help localize the target object's nutrient composition spatially and spectrally. Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a cutting-edge implicit representation that can render hyperspectral channel compositions of each spatial location from any viewing direction. However, it faces limitations in training time and rendering speed. In this paper, we propose Hyperspectral Gaussian Splatting (HS-GS), which combines the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with a diffusion model to enable 3D explicit reconstruction of the hyperspectral scenes and novel view synthesis for the entire spectral range. To enhance the model's ability to capture fine-grained reflectance variations across the light spectrum and leverage correlations between adjacent wavelengths for denoising, we introduce a wavelength encoder to generate wavelength-specific spherical harmonics offsets. We also introduce a novel Kullback--Leibler divergence-based loss to mitigate the spectral distribution gap between the rendered image and the ground truth. A diffusion model is further applied for denoising the rendered images and generating photorealistic hyperspectral images. We present extensive evaluations on five diverse hyperspectral scenes from the Hyper-NeRF dataset to show the effectiveness of our proposed HS-GS framework. The results demonstrate that HS-GS achieves new state-of-the-art performance among all previously published methods. Code will be released upon publication.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable potential in generating high-quality images. However, their tendency to replicate training data raises serious privacy concerns, particularly when the training datasets contain sensitive or private information. Existing mitigation strategies primarily focus on reducing image duplication, modifying the cross-attention mechanism, and altering the denoising backbone architecture of diffusion models. Moreover, recent work has shown that adding a consistent small amount of noise to text embeddings can reduce replication to some degree. In this work, we begin by analyzing the impact of adding varying amounts of noise. Based on our analysis, we propose a fine-grained noise injection technique that probabilistically adds a larger amount of noise to token embeddings. We refer to our method as Fine-grained Probabilistic Addition of Noise (FPAN). Through our extensive experiments, we show that our proposed FPAN can reduce replication by an average of 28.78% compared to the baseline diffusion model without significantly impacting image quality, and outperforms the prior consistent-magnitude-noise-addition approach by 26.51%. Moreover, when combined with other existing mitigation methods, our FPAN approach can further reduce replication by up to 16.82% with similar, if not improved, image quality.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, their iterative denoising process results in significant computational overhead during inference, limiting their practical deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing acceleration methods often adopt uniform strategies that fail to capture the temporal variations during diffusion generation, while the commonly adopted sequential pruning-then-fine-tuning strategy suffers from sub-optimality due to the misalignment between pruning decisions made on pretrained weights and the model's final parameters. To address these limitations, we introduce ALTER: All-in-One Layer Pruning and Temporal Expert Routing, a unified framework that transforms diffusion models into a mixture of efficient temporal experts. ALTER achieves a single-stage optimization that unifies layer pruning, expert routing, and model fine-tuning by employing a trainable hypernetwork, which dynamically generates layer pruning decisions and manages timestep routing to specialized, pruned expert sub-networks throughout the ongoing fine-tuning of the UNet. This unified co-optimization strategy enables significant efficiency gains while preserving high generative quality. Specifically, ALTER achieves same-level visual fidelity to the original 50-step Stable Diffusion v2.1 model while utilizing only 25.9% of its total MACs with just 20 inference steps and delivering a 3.64x speedup through 35% sparsity.

  Recent video diffusion models have demonstrated their great capability in generating visually-pleasing results, while synthesizing the correct physical effects in generated videos remains challenging. The complexity of real-world motions, interactions, and dynamics introduce great difficulties when learning physics from data. In this work, we propose DiffPhy, a generic framework that enables physically-correct and photo-realistic video generation by fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion model. Our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to explicitly reason a comprehensive physical context from the text prompt and use it to guide the generation. To incorporate physical context into the diffusion model, we leverage a Multimodal large language model (MLLM) as a supervisory signal and introduce a set of novel training objectives that jointly enforce physical correctness and semantic consistency with the input text. We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPhy is able to produce state-of-the-art results across diverse physics-related scenarios.

  Video Virtual Try-On (VVT) aims to simulate the natural appearance of garments across consecutive video frames, capturing their dynamic variations and interactions with human body motion. However, current VVT methods still face challenges in terms of spatiotemporal consistency and garment content preservation. First, they use diffusion models based on the U-Net, which are limited in their expressive capability and struggle to reconstruct complex details. Second, they adopt a separative modeling approach for spatial and temporal attention, which hinders the effective capture of structural relationships and dynamic consistency across frames. Third, their expression of garment details remains insufficient, affecting the realism and stability of the overall synthesized results, especially during human motion. To address the above challenges, we propose MagicTryOn, a video virtual try-on framework built upon the large-scale video diffusion Transformer. We replace the U-Net architecture with a diffusion Transformer and combine full self-attention to jointly model the spatiotemporal consistency of videos. We design a coarse-to-fine garment preservation strategy. The coarse strategy integrates garment tokens during the embedding stage, while the fine strategy incorporates multiple garment-based conditions, such as semantics, textures, and contour lines during the denoising stage. Moreover, we introduce a mask-aware loss to further optimize garment region fidelity. Extensive experiments on both image and video try-on datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SOTA methods in comprehensive evaluations and generalizes to in-the-wild scenarios.

  We present DIPO, a novel framework for the controllable generation of articulated 3D objects from a pair of images: one depicting the object in a resting state and the other in an articulated state. Compared to the single-image approach, our dual-image input imposes only a modest overhead for data collection, but at the same time provides important motion information, which is a reliable guide for predicting kinematic relationships between parts. Specifically, we propose a dual-image diffusion model that captures relationships between the image pair to generate part layouts and joint parameters. In addition, we introduce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based graph reasoner that explicitly infers part connectivity relationships. To further improve robustness and generalization on complex articulated objects, we develop a fully automated dataset expansion pipeline, name LEGO-Art, that enriches the diversity and complexity of PartNet-Mobility dataset. We propose PM-X, a large-scale dataset of complex articulated 3D objects, accompanied by rendered images, URDF annotations, and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIPO significantly outperforms existing baselines in both the resting state and the articulated state, while the proposed PM-X dataset further enhances generalization to diverse and structurally complex articulated objects.

  Graphic design plays a vital role in visual communication across advertising, marketing, and multimedia entertainment. Prior work has explored automated graphic design generation using diffusion models, aiming to streamline creative workflows and democratize design capabilities. However, complex graphic design scenarios require accurately adhering to design intent specified by multiple heterogeneous user-provided elements (\eg images, layouts, and texts), which pose multi-condition control challenges for existing methods. Specifically, previous single-condition control models demonstrate effectiveness only within their specialized domains but fail to generalize to other conditions, while existing multi-condition methods often lack fine-grained control over each sub-condition and compromise overall compositional harmony. To address these limitations, we introduce CreatiDesign, a systematic solution for automated graphic design covering both model architecture and dataset construction. First, we design a unified multi-condition driven architecture that enables flexible and precise integration of heterogeneous design elements with minimal architectural modifications to the base diffusion model. Furthermore, to ensure that each condition precisely controls its designated image region and to avoid interference between conditions, we propose a multimodal attention mask mechanism. Additionally, we develop a fully automated pipeline for constructing graphic design datasets, and introduce a new dataset with 400K samples featuring multi-condition annotations, along with a comprehensive benchmark. Experimental results show that CreatiDesign outperforms existing models by a clear margin in faithfully adhering to user intent.

  While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images from text prompts, they struggle with visual consistency in image sequences. Existing methods generate each image independently, leading to disjointed narratives - a challenge further exacerbated in non-linear storytelling, where scenes must connect beyond adjacent frames. We introduce a novel beam search strategy for latent space exploration, enabling conditional generation of full image sequences with beam search decoding. Unlike prior approaches that use fixed latent priors, our method dynamically searches for an optimal sequence of latent representations, ensuring coherent visual transitions. As the latent denoising space is explored, the beam search graph is pruned with a cross-attention mechanism that efficiently scores search paths, prioritizing alignment with both textual prompts and visual context. Human and automatic evaluations confirm that BeamDiffusion outperforms other baseline methods, producing full sequences with superior coherence, visual continuity, and textual alignment.

  Diffusion models have emerged as a dominant approach for text-to-image generation. Key components such as the human preference alignment and classifier-free guidance play a crucial role in ensuring generation quality. However, their independent application in current text-to-image models continues to face significant challenges in achieving strong text-image alignment, high generation quality, and consistency with human aesthetic standards. In this work, we for the first time, explore facilitating the collaboration of human performance alignment and test-time sampling to unlock the potential of text-to-image models. Consequently, we introduce CHATS (Combining Human-Aligned optimization and Test-time Sampling), a novel generative framework that separately models the preferred and dispreferred distributions and employs a proxy-prompt-based sampling strategy to utilize the useful information contained in both distributions. We observe that CHATS exhibits exceptional data efficiency, achieving strong performance with only a small, high-quality funetuning dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CHATS surpasses traditional preference alignment methods, setting new state-of-the-art across various standard benchmarks.

  Despite significant advancements in video generation, inserting a given object into videos remains a challenging task. The difficulty lies in preserving the appearance details of the reference object and accurately modeling coherent motions at the same time. In this paper, we propose VideoAnydoor, a zero-shot video object insertion framework with high-fidelity detail preservation and precise motion control. Starting from a text-to-video model, we utilize an ID extractor to inject the global identity and leverage a box sequence to control the overall motion. To preserve the detailed appearance and meanwhile support fine-grained motion control, we design a pixel warper. It takes the reference image with arbitrary key-points and the corresponding key-point trajectories as inputs. It warps the pixel details according to the trajectories and fuses the warped features with the diffusion U-Net, thus improving detail preservation and supporting users in manipulating the motion trajectories. In addition, we propose a training strategy involving both videos and static images with a weighted loss to enhance insertion quality. VideoAnydoor demonstrates significant superiority over existing methods and naturally supports various downstream applications (e.g., talking head generation, video virtual try-on, multi-region editing) without task-specific fine-tuning.

  This paper introduces MIDI, a novel paradigm for compositional 3D scene generation from a single image. Unlike existing methods that rely on reconstruction or retrieval techniques or recent approaches that employ multi-stage object-by-object generation, MIDI extends pre-trained image-to-3D object generation models to multi-instance diffusion models, enabling the simultaneous generation of multiple 3D instances with accurate spatial relationships and high generalizability. At its core, MIDI incorporates a novel multi-instance attention mechanism, that effectively captures inter-object interactions and spatial coherence directly within the generation process, without the need for complex multi-step processes. The method utilizes partial object images and global scene context as inputs, directly modeling object completion during 3D generation. During training, we effectively supervise the interactions between 3D instances using a limited amount of scene-level data, while incorporating single-object data for regularization, thereby maintaining the pre-trained generalization ability. MIDI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in image-to-scene generation, validated through evaluations on synthetic data, real-world scene data, and stylized scene images generated by text-to-image diffusion models.

  Discrete diffusion models are a class of generative models that construct sequences by progressively denoising samples from a categorical noise distribution. Beyond their rapidly growing ability to generate coherent natural language, these models present a new and important opportunity to enforce sequence-level constraints, a capability that current autoregressive models cannot natively provide. This paper capitalizes on this opportunity by introducing Constrained Discrete Diffusion (CDD), a novel integration of differentiable constraint optimization within the diffusion process to ensure adherence to constraints, logic rules, or safety requirements for generated sequences. Unlike conventional text generators that often rely on post-hoc filtering or model retraining for controllable generation, CDD directly imposes constraints into the discrete diffusion sampling process, resulting in a training-free and effective approach. Experiments in toxicity-controlled text generation, property-constrained molecule design, and instruction-constrained text completion demonstrate that CDD achieves zero constraint violations in a diverse array of tasks while preserving fluency, novelty, and coherence while outperforming autoregressive and existing discrete diffusion approaches.

  Diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for text generation, with recent works falling into two main categories: discrete and continuous diffusion models. Discrete diffusion models apply token corruption independently using categorical distributions, allowing for different diffusion progress across tokens but lacking fine-grained control. Continuous diffusion models map tokens to continuous spaces and apply fine-grained noise, but the diffusion progress is uniform across tokens, limiting their ability to capture semantic nuances. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\underline{N}}on-simultan\textbf{\underline{e}}ous C\textbf{\underline{o}}ntinuous \textbf{\underline{Diff}}usion Models (NeoDiff), a novel diffusion model that integrates the strengths of both discrete and continuous approaches. NeoDiff introduces a Poisson diffusion process for the forward process, enabling a flexible and fine-grained noising paradigm, and employs a time predictor for the reverse process to adaptively modulate the denoising progress based on token semantics. Furthermore, NeoDiff utilizes an optimized schedule for inference to ensure more precise noise control and improved performance. Our approach unifies the theories of discrete and continuous diffusion models, offering a more principled and effective framework for text generation. Experimental results on several text generation tasks demonstrate NeoDiff's superior performance compared to baselines of non-autoregressive continuous and discrete diffusion models, iterative-based methods and autoregressive diffusion-based methods. These results highlight NeoDiff's potential as a powerful tool for generating high-quality text and advancing the field of diffusion-based text generation.

  Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) frequently occurs under general anesthesia and is strongly linked to adverse outcomes such as myocardial injury and increased mortality. Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability in clinical decision support scenarios.

  Diffusion-based large language models (Diffusion LLMs) have shown promise for non-autoregressive text generation with parallel decoding capabilities. However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we propose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \textbf{27.6$\times$ throughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of Diffusion LLMs.

  While foundation models (FMs), such as diffusion models and large vision-language models (LVLMs), have been widely applied in educational contexts, their ability to generate pedagogically effective visual explanations remains limited. Most existing approaches focus primarily on textual reasoning, overlooking the critical role of structured and interpretable visualizations in supporting conceptual understanding. To better assess the visual reasoning capabilities of FMs in educational settings, we introduce EduVisBench, a multi-domain, multi-level benchmark. EduVisBench features diverse STEM problem sets requiring visually grounded solutions, along with a fine-grained evaluation rubric informed by pedagogical theory. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing models frequently struggle with the inherent challenge of decomposing complex reasoning and translating it into visual representations aligned with human cognitive processes. To address these limitations, we propose EduVisAgent, a multi-agent collaborative framework that coordinates specialized agents for instructional planning, reasoning decomposition, metacognitive prompting, and visualization design. Experimental results show that EduVisAgent substantially outperforms all baselines, achieving a 40.2% improvement and delivering more educationally aligned visualizations.
