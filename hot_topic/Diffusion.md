- **[AC-DiT: Adaptive Coordination Diffusion Transformer for Mobile Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01961)**  `arXiv:2507.01961`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Sixiang Chen, Jiaming Liu, Siyuan Qian, Han Jiang, Lily Li, Renrui Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, mobile manipulation has attracted increasing attention for enabling language-conditioned robotic control in household tasks. However, existing methods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator, primarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly model the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily leads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand, they treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual observation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct multimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile manipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion Transformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination for end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base directly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body conditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion representations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body actions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact of the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at different stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware multimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights between various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features tailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for example, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial for action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric information when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile manipulation tasks.

- **[SE(3)-Equivariant Diffusion Policy in Spherical Fourier Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01723)**  `arXiv:2507.01723`  `cs.RO`  
  _Xupeng Zhu, Fan Wang, Robin Walters, Jane Shi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Policies are effective at learning closed-loop manipulation policies from human demonstrations but generalize poorly to novel arrangements of objects in 3D space, hurting real-world performance. To address this issue, we propose Spherical Diffusion Policy (SDP), an SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy that adapts trajectories according to 3D transformations of the scene. Such equivariance is achieved by embedding the states, actions, and the denoising process in spherical Fourier space. Additionally, we employ novel spherical FiLM layers to condition the action denoising process equivariantly on the scene embeddings. Lastly, we propose a spherical denoising temporal U-net that achieves spatiotemporal equivariance with computational efficiency. In the end, SDP is end-to-end SE(3) equivariant, allowing robust generalization across transformed 3D scenes. SDP demonstrates a large performance improvement over strong baselines in 20 simulation tasks and 5 physical robot tasks including single-arm and bi-manual embodiments.

- **[SonoGym: High Performance Simulation for Challenging Surgical Tasks with Robotic Ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01152)**  `arXiv:2507.01152`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yunke Ao, Masoud Moghani, Mayank Mittal, Manish Prajapat, Luohong Wu, Frederic Giraud, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ultrasound (US) is a widely used medical imaging modality due to its real-time capabilities, non-invasive nature, and cost-effectiveness. Robotic ultrasound can further enhance its utility by reducing operator dependence and improving access to complex anatomical regions. For this, while deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and imitation learning (IL) have shown potential for autonomous navigation, their use in complex surgical tasks such as anatomy reconstruction and surgical guidance remains limited -- largely due to the lack of realistic and efficient simulation environments tailored to these tasks. We introduce SonoGym, a scalable simulation platform for complex robotic ultrasound tasks that enables parallel simulation across tens to hundreds of environments. Our framework supports realistic and real-time simulation of US data from CT-derived 3D models of the anatomy through both a physics-based and a generative modeling approach. Sonogym enables the training of DRL and recent IL agents (vision transformers and diffusion policies) for relevant tasks in robotic orthopedic surgery by integrating common robotic platforms and orthopedic end effectors. We further incorporate submodular DRL -- a recent method that handles history-dependent rewards -- for anatomy reconstruction and safe reinforcement learning for surgery. Our results demonstrate successful policy learning across a range of scenarios, while also highlighting the limitations of current methods in clinically relevant environments. We believe our simulation can facilitate research in robot learning approaches for such challenging robotic surgery applications. Dataset, codes, and videos are publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[DexH2R: A Benchmark for Dynamic Dexterous Grasping in Human-to-Robot Handover](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23152)**  `arXiv:2506.23152`  `cs.RO`  
  _Youzhuo Wang, Jiayi Ye, Chuyang Xiao, Yiming Zhong, Heng Tao, Hang Yu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Handover between a human and a dexterous robotic hand is a fundamental yet challenging task in human-robot collaboration. It requires handling dynamic environments and a wide variety of objects and demands robust and adaptive grasping strategies. However, progress in developing effective dynamic dexterous grasping methods is limited by the absence of high-quality, real-world human-to-robot handover datasets. Existing datasets primarily focus on grasping static objects or rely on synthesized handover motions, which differ significantly from real-world robot motion patterns, creating a substantial gap in applicability. In this paper, we introduce DexH2R, a comprehensive real-world dataset for human-to-robot handovers, built on a dexterous robotic hand. Our dataset captures a diverse range of interactive objects, dynamic motion patterns, rich visual sensor data, and detailed annotations. Additionally, to ensure natural and human-like dexterous motions, we utilize teleoperation for data collection, enabling the robot's movements to align with human behaviors and habits, which is a crucial characteristic for intelligent humanoid robots. Furthermore, we propose an effective solution, DynamicGrasp, for human-to-robot handover and evaluate various state-of-the-art approaches, including auto-regressive models and diffusion policy methods, providing a thorough comparison and analysis. We believe our benchmark will drive advancements in human-to-robot handover research by offering a high-quality dataset, effective solutions, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.

- **[Improving Consistency Models with Generator-Augmented Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09570)**  `arXiv:2406.09570`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Thibaut Issenhuth, Sangchul Lee, Ludovic Dos Santos, Jean-Yves Franceschi, Chansoo Kim, Alain Rakotomamonjy_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Consistency models imitate the multi-step sampling of score-based diffusion in a single forward pass of a neural network. They can be learned in two ways: consistency distillation and consistency training. The former relies on the true velocity field of the corresponding differential equation, approximated by a pre-trained neural network. In contrast, the latter uses a single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of this velocity field. The related estimation error induces a discrepancy between consistency distillation and training that, we show, still holds in the continuous-time limit. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel flow that transports noisy data towards their corresponding outputs derived from a consistency model. We prove that this flow reduces the previously identified discrepancy and the noise-data transport cost. Consequently, our method not only accelerates consistency training convergence but also enhances its overall performance. The code is available at:this https URL.

- **[Distributional Soft Actor-Critic with Diffusion Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01381)**  `arXiv:2507.01381`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Tong Liu, Yinuo Wang, Xujie Song, Wenjun Zou, Liangfa Chen, Likun Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D (Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all 9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total average return improvement of over 10\% compared to existing mainstream algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.

- **[Loss Functions in Diffusion Models: A Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01516)**  `arXiv:2507.01516`  `cs.LG`  
  _Dibyanshu Kumar, Philipp Vaeth, Magda Gregorov√°_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, inspiring extensive research into their underlying mechanisms. One of the key questions in this area is the loss functions these models shall train with. Multiple formulations have been introduced in the literature over the past several years with some links and some critical differences stemming from various initial considerations. In this paper, we explore the different target objectives and corresponding loss functions in detail. We present a systematic overview of their relationships, unifying them under the framework of the variational lower bound objective. We complement this theoretical analysis with an empirical study providing insights into the conditions under which these objectives diverge in performance and the underlying factors contributing to such deviations. Additionally, we evaluate how the choice of objective impacts the model ability to achieve specific goals, such as generating high-quality samples or accurately estimating likelihoods. This study offers a unified understanding of loss functions in diffusion models, contributing to more efficient and goal-oriented model designs in future research.

- **[Diffusion Explorer: Interactive Exploration of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01178)**  `arXiv:2507.01178`  `cs.LG`  
  _Alec Helbling, Duen Horng Chau_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have been central to the development of recent image, video, and even text generation systems. They posses striking geometric properties that can be faithfully portrayed in low-dimensional settings. However, existing resources for explaining diffusion either require an advanced theoretical foundation or focus on their neural network architectures rather than their rich geometric properties. We introduce Diffusion Explorer, an interactive tool to explain the geometric properties of diffusion models. Users can train 2D diffusion models in the browser and observe the temporal dynamics of their sampling process. Diffusion Explorer leverages interactive animation, which has been shown to be a powerful tool for making engaging visualizations of dynamic systems, making it well suited to explaining diffusion models which represent stochastic processes that evolve over time. Diffusion Explorer is open source and a live demo is available atthis http URL.

- **[On the Trade-off between Flatness and Optimization in Distributed Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20006)**  `arXiv:2406.20006`  `cs.LG`  
  _Ying Cao, Zhaoxian Wu, Kun Yuan, Ali H. Sayed_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a theoretical framework to evaluate and compare the performance of stochastic gradient algorithms for distributed learning in relation to their behavior around local minima in nonconvex environments. Previous works have noticed that convergence toward flat local minima tend to enhance the generalization ability of learning algorithms. This work discovers three interesting results. First, it shows that decentralized learning strategies are able to escape faster away from local minima and favor convergence toward flatter minima relative to the centralized solution. Second, in decentralized methods, the consensus strategy has a worse excess-risk performance than diffusion, giving it a better chance of escaping from local minima and favoring flatter minima. Third, and importantly, the ultimate classification accuracy is not solely dependent on the flatness of the local minimum but also on how well a learning algorithm can approach that minimum. In other words, the classification accuracy is a function of both flatness and optimization performance. In this regard, since diffusion has a lower excess-risk than consensus, when both algorithms are trained starting from random initial points, diffusion enhances the classification accuracy. The paper examines the interplay between the two measures of flatness and optimization error closely. One important conclusion is that decentralized strategies deliver in general enhanced classification accuracy because they strike a more favorable balance between flatness and optimization performance compared to the centralized solution.

- **[Diffusion Policies for Risk-Averse Behavior Modeling in Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17646)**  `arXiv:2403.17646`  `cs.LG`  
  _Xiaocong Chen, Siyu Wang, Tong Yu, Lina Yao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents distinct challenges as it relies solely on observational data. A central concern in this context is ensuring the safety of the learned policy by quantifying uncertainties associated with various actions and environmental stochasticity. Traditional approaches primarily emphasize mitigating epistemic uncertainty by learning risk-averse policies, often overlooking environmental stochasticity. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware distributional offline RL method to simultaneously address both epistemic uncertainty and environmental stochasticity. We propose a model-free offline RL algorithm capable of learning risk-averse policies and characterizing the entire distribution of discounted cumulative rewards, as opposed to merely maximizing the expected value of accumulated discounted returns. Our method is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments in both risk-sensitive and risk-neutral benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance.

- **[EP-Diffuser: An Efficient Diffusion Model for Traffic Scene Generation and Prediction via Polynomial Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05422)**  `arXiv:2504.05422`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG` `cs.RO`  
  _Yue Yao, Mohamed-Khalil Bouzidi, Daniel Goehring, Joerg Reichardt_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As the prediction horizon increases, predicting the future evolution of traffic scenes becomes increasingly difficult due to the multi-modal nature of agent motion. Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach.

- **[ConceptAttention: Diffusion Transformers Learn Highly Interpretable Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04320)**  `arXiv:2502.04320`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Alec Helbling, Tuna Han Salih Meral, Ben Hoover, Pinar Yanardag, Duen Horng Chau_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Do the rich representations of multi-modal diffusion transformers (DiTs) exhibit unique properties that enhance their interpretability? We introduce ConceptAttention, a novel method that leverages the expressive power of DiT attention layers to generate high-quality saliency maps that precisely locate textual concepts within images. Without requiring additional training, ConceptAttention repurposes the parameters of DiT attention layers to produce highly contextualized concept embeddings, contributing the major discovery that performing linear projections in the output space of DiT attention layers yields significantly sharper saliency maps compared to commonly used cross-attention maps. ConceptAttention even achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot image segmentation benchmarks, outperforming 15 other zero-shot interpretability methods on the ImageNet-Segmentation dataset. ConceptAttention works for popular image models and even seamlessly generalizes to video generation. Our work contributes the first evidence that the representations of multi-modal DiTs are highly transferable to vision tasks like segmentation.

- **[DocShaDiffusion: Diffusion Model in Latent Space for Document Image Shadow Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01422)**  `arXiv:2507.01422`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Wenjie Liu, Bingshu Wang, Ze Wang, C.L. Philip Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Document shadow removal is a crucial task in the field of document image enhancement. However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant color background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a diffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called DocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space, enabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the issue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM). It is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions specially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion module (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by supervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a shadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in document images. Moreover, we develop a large-scale synthetic document color shadow removal dataset (SDCSRD). It simulates the distribution of realistic color shadows and provides powerful supports for the training of models. Experiments on three public datasets validate the proposed method's superiority over state-of-the-art. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

- **[There and Back Again: On the relation between Noise and Image Inversions in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23530)**  `arXiv:2410.23530`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _≈Åukasz Staniszewski, ≈Åukasz Kuci≈Ñski, Kamil Deja_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Models achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating new samples but lack a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the data into meaningful features. Inversion-based methods address this by reversing the denoising trajectory, mapping each image back to its approximated starting noise. In this work, we thoroughly analyze this procedure and focus on the relation between the initial Gaussian noise, the generated samples, and their corresponding latent encodings obtained through the DDIM inversion. First, we show that latents exhibit structural patterns in the form of less diverse noise predicted for smooth image regions. As a consequence of this divergence, we present that the space of image inversions is notably less manipulative than the original Gaussian noise. Next, we explain the origin of the phenomenon, demonstrating that, during the first inversion steps, the noise prediction error is much more significant for the plain areas than for the rest of the image. As a surprisingly simple solution, we propose to replace the first DDIM Inversion steps with a forward diffusion process, which successfully decorrelates latent encodings, leading to higher quality editions and interpolations.

- **[FreeMorph: Tuning-Free Generalized Image Morphing with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01953)**  `arXiv:2507.01953`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yukang Cao, Chenyang Si, Jinghao Wang, Ziwei Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present FreeMorph, the first tuning-free method for image morphing that accommodates inputs with different semantics or layouts. Unlike existing methods that rely on finetuning pre-trained diffusion models and are limited by time constraints and semantic/layout discrepancies, FreeMorph delivers high-fidelity image morphing without requiring per-instance training. Despite their efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in maintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step denoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In this paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating two key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical interpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images by modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and ensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We further introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention modules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent transitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and establishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.

- **[Reasoning to Edit: Hypothetical Instruction-Based Image Editing with Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01908)**  `arXiv:2507.01908`  `cs.CV`  
  _Qingdong He, Xueqin Chen, Chaoyi Wang, Yanjie Pan, Xiaobin Hu, Zhenye Gan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success of diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting, moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities. Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis, incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks. Our dataset and code will be released publicly.

- **[HOI-Dyn: Learning Interaction Dynamics for Human-Object Motion Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01737)**  `arXiv:2507.01737`  `cs.CV`  
  _Lin Wu, Zhixiang Chen, Jianglin Lan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating realistic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of modeling detailed interaction dynamics. Existing methods treat human and object motions independently, resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training, preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the quality of generated interactions.

- **[RobuSTereo: Robust Zero-Shot Stereo Matching under Adverse Weather](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01653)**  `arXiv:2507.01653`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yuran Wang, Yingping Liang, Yutao Hu, Ying Fu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning-based stereo matching models struggle in adverse weather conditions due to the scarcity of corresponding training data and the challenges in extracting discriminative features from degraded images. These limitations significantly hinder zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution weather conditions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RobuSTereo}, a novel framework that enhances the zero-shot generalization of stereo matching models under adverse weather by addressing both data scarcity and feature extraction challenges. First, we introduce a diffusion-based simulation pipeline with a stereo consistency module, which generates high-quality stereo data tailored for adverse conditions. By training stereo matching models on our synthetic datasets, we reduce the domain gap between clean and degraded images, significantly improving the models' robustness to unseen weather conditions. The stereo consistency module ensures structural alignment across synthesized image pairs, preserving geometric integrity and enhancing depth estimation accuracy. Second, we design a robust feature encoder that combines a specialized ConvNet with a denoising transformer to extract stable and reliable features from degraded images. The ConvNet captures fine-grained local structures, while the denoising transformer refines global representations, effectively mitigating the impact of noise, low visibility, and weather-induced distortions. This enables more accurate disparity estimation even under challenging visual conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{RobuSTereo} significantly improves the robustness and generalization of stereo matching models across diverse adverse weather scenarios.

- **[DepthSync: Diffusion Guidance-Based Depth Synchronization for Scale- and Geometry-Consistent Video Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01603)**  `arXiv:2507.01603`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yue-Jiang Dong, Wang Zhao, Jiale Xu, Ying Shan, Song-Hai Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based video depth estimation methods have achieved remarkable success with strong generalization ability. However, predicting depth for long videos remains challenging. Existing methods typically split videos into overlapping sliding windows, leading to accumulated scale discrepancies across different windows, particularly as the number of windows increases. Additionally, these methods rely solely on 2D diffusion priors, overlooking the inherent 3D geometric structure of video depths, which results in geometrically inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose DepthSync, a novel, training-free framework using diffusion guidance to achieve scale- and geometry-consistent depth predictions for long videos. Specifically, we introduce scale guidance to synchronize the depth scale across windows and geometry guidance to enforce geometric alignment within windows based on the inherent 3D constraints in video depths. These two terms work synergistically, steering the denoising process toward consistent depth predictions. Experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in producing depth estimates with improved scale and geometry consistency, particularly for long videos.

  _Bryan Constantine Sadihin, Michael Hua Wang, Shei Pern Chua, Hang Su_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The production of high-quality 2D animation is highly labor-intensive process, as animators are currently required to draw and color a large number of frames by hand. We present SketchColour, the first sketch-to-colour pipeline for 2D animation built on a diffusion transformer (DiT) backbone. By replacing the conventional U-Net denoiser with a DiT-style architecture and injecting sketch information via lightweight channel-concatenation adapters accompanied with LoRA finetuning, our method natively integrates conditioning without the parameter and memory bloat of a duplicated ControlNet, greatly reducing parameter count and GPU memory usage. Evaluated on the SAKUGA dataset, SketchColour outperforms previous state-of-the-art video colourization methods across all metrics, despite using only half the training data of competing models. Our approach produces temporally coherent animations with minimal artifacts such as colour bleeding or object deformation. Our code is available at:this https URL.

- **[A Gift from the Integration of Discriminative and Diffusion-based Generative Learning: Boundary Refinement Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01573)**  `arXiv:2507.01573`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hao Wang, Keyan Hu, Xin Guo, Haifeng Li, Chao Tao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Remote sensing semantic segmentation must address both what the ground objects are within an image and where they are located. Consequently, segmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of large-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise localization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information). However, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning, which excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its inherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic segmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models excel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms that the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability to learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models exhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided solely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both discriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of Discriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement (IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map using a discriminative backbone model. This map and the original image are fed into a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation subsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the coarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic segmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our framework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results from diverse discriminative architectures. The source code will be available atthis https URL.

- **[ReFlex: Text-Guided Editing of Real Images in Rectified Flow via Mid-Step Feature Extraction and Attention Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01496)**  `arXiv:2507.01496`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jimyeong Kim, Jungwon Park, Yeji Song, Nojun Kwak, Wonjong Rhee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rectified Flow text-to-image models surpass diffusion models in image quality and text alignment, but adapting ReFlow for real-image editing remains challenging. We propose a new real-image editing method for ReFlow by analyzing the intermediate representations of multimodal transformer blocks and identifying three key features. To extract these features from real images with sufficient structural preservation, we leverage mid-step latent, which is inverted only up to the mid-step. We then adapt attention during injection to improve editability and enhance alignment to the target text. Our method is training-free, requires no user-provided mask, and can be applied even without a source prompt. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks with nine baselines demonstrate its superior performance over prior methods, further validated by human evaluations confirming a strong user preference for our approach.

- **[Representation Entanglement for Generation:Training Diffusion Transformers Is Much Easier Than You Think](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01467)**  `arXiv:2507.01467`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ge Wu, Shen Zhang, Ruijing Shi, Shanghua Gao, Zhenyuan Chen, Lei Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  REPA and its variants effectively mitigate training challenges in diffusion models by incorporating external visual representations from pretrained models, through alignment between the noisy hidden projections of denoising networks and foundational clean image representations. We argue that the external alignment, which is absent during the entire denoising inference process, falls short of fully harnessing the potential of discriminative representations. In this work, we propose a straightforward method called Representation Entanglement for Generation (REG), which entangles low-level image latents with a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for denoising. REG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and training efficiency. This is accomplished with negligible additional inference overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\% increase in FLOPs and latency). The inference process concurrently reconstructs both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence acceleration, achieving $\textbf{63}\times$ and $\textbf{23}\times$ faster training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively. More impressively, SiT-L/2 + REG trained for merely 400K iterations outperforms SiT-XL/2 + REPA trained for 4M iterations ($\textbf{10}\times$ longer). Code is available at:this https URL.

  Unpaired image dehazing has attracted increasing attention due to its flexible data requirements during model training. Dominant methods based on contrastive learning not only introduce haze-unrelated content information, but also ignore haze-specific properties in the frequency domain (\ie,~haze-related degradation is mainly manifested in the amplitude spectrum). To address these issues, we propose a novel frequency domain-based diffusion model, named \ours, for fully exploiting the beneficial knowledge in unpaired clear data. In particular, inspired by the strong generative ability shown by Diffusion Models (DMs), we tackle the dehazing task from the perspective of frequency domain reconstruction and perform the DMs to yield the amplitude spectrum consistent with the distribution of clear images. To implement it, we propose an Amplitude Residual Encoder (ARE) to extract the amplitude residuals, which effectively compensates for the amplitude gap from the hazy to clear domains, as well as provide supervision for the DMs training. In addition, we propose a Phase Correction Module (PCM) to eliminate artifacts by further refining the phase spectrum during dehazing with a simple attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that our \ours outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

  Text-to-image generation has greatly advanced content creation, yet accurately rendering visual text remains a key challenge due to blurred glyphs, semantic drift, and limited style control. Existing methods often rely on pre-rendered glyph images as conditions, but these struggle to retain original font styles and color cues, necessitating complex multi-branch designs that increase model overhead and reduce flexibility. To address these issues, we propose a segmentation-guided framework that uses pixel-level visual text masks -- rich in glyph shape, color, and spatial detail -- as unified conditional inputs. Our method introduces two core components: (1) a fine-tuned bilingual segmentation model for precise text mask extraction, and (2) a streamlined diffusion model augmented with adaptive glyph conditioning and a region-specific loss to preserve textual fidelity in both content and style. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AnyText benchmark, significantly surpassing prior methods in both Chinese and English settings. To enable more rigorous evaluation, we also introduce two new benchmarks: GlyphMM-benchmark for testing layout and glyph consistency in complex typesetting, and MiniText-benchmark for assessing generation quality in small-scale text regions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both scenarios, particularly excelling at small text rendering and complex layout preservation, validating its strong generalization and deployment readiness.

  Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1$.$dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available atthis https URLand our code is available atthis https URL.

  Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize images of user-provided concepts in diverse contexts. Despite recent progress in multi-concept personalization, most are limited to object concepts and struggle to customize abstract concepts (e.g., pose, lighting). Some methods have begun exploring multi-concept personalization supporting abstract concepts, but they require test-time fine-tuning for each new concept, which is time-consuming and prone to overfitting on limited training images. In this work, we propose a novel tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization that can effectively customize both object and abstract concepts without test-time fine-tuning. Our method builds upon the modulation mechanism in pretrained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) model, leveraging the localized and semantically meaningful properties of the modulation space. Specifically, we propose a novel module, Mod-Adapter, to predict concept-specific modulation direction for the modulation process of concept-related text tokens. It incorporates vision-language cross-attention for extracting concept visual features, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers that adaptively map the concept features into the modulation space. Furthermore, to mitigate the training difficulty caused by the large gap between the concept image space and the modulation space, we introduce a VLM-guided pretraining strategy that leverages the strong image understanding capabilities of vision-language models to provide semantic supervision signals. For a comprehensive comparison, we extend a standard benchmark by incorporating abstract concepts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-concept personalization, supported by quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations.

  Diffusion-based large language models (Diffusion LLMs) have shown promise for non-autoregressive text generation with parallel decoding capabilities. However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we propose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \textbf{27.6$\times$ throughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of Diffusion LLMs.
