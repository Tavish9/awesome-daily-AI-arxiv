  Robotic odour source localization (OSL) is a critical capability for autonomous systems operating in complex environments. However, current OSL methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines. This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and training methods, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors, enabling them to detect more compounds and inform better hardware design. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound in critical applications such as explosives detection, narcotics screening, and search and rescue. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.

  Model-free diffusion planners have shown great promise for robot motion planning, but practical robotic systems often require combining them with model-based optimization modules to enforce constraints, such as safety. Naively integrating these modules presents compatibility challenges when diffusion's multi-modal outputs behave adversarially to optimization-based modules. To address this, we introduce Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion (JM2D), a novel generative modeling framework. JM2D formulates module integration as a joint sampling problem to maximize compatibility via an interaction potential, without additional training. Using importance sampling, JM2D guides modules outputs based only on evaluations of the interaction potential, thus handling non-differentiable objectives commonly arising from non-convex optimization modules. We evaluate JM2D via application to aligning diffusion planners with safety modules on offline RL and robot manipulation. JM2D significantly improves task performance compared to conventional safety filters without sacrificing safety. Further, we show that conditional generation is a special case of JM2D and elucidate key design choices by comparing with SOTA gradient-based and projection-based diffusion planners.

- **[Data Driven Discovery of Emergent Dynamics in Reaction Diffusion Systems from Sparse and Noisy Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09278)**  `arXiv:2509.09278`  `cs.LG` `cs.MA`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity, particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology, epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics. A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models, such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data. This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.

  Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints. While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration (PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for flexible, multi-property molecular design.

- **[Missing Fine Details in Images: Last Seen in High Frequencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05441)**  `arXiv:2509.05441`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been proposed to learn effective latent representations, generated images often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions, due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency information during optimization, leading to over-smoothed outputs and visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures while preserving global structure. Moreover, we integrate our frequency-preserving latent embeddings into a SOTA latent diffusion model, resulting in sharper and more realistic image generation. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware optimization for realistic image synthesis, with broader implications for applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

  Congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs) can lead to infertility, miscarriage, preterm birth, and an increased risk of pregnancy complications. Compared to traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane, providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text) guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Deep Learning models are incredibly data-hungry and require very large labeled datasets for supervised learning. As a consequence, these models often suffer from overfitting, limiting their ability to generalize to real-world examples. Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled the generation of photorealistic images based on textual inputs. Leveraging the substantial datasets used to train these diffusion models, we propose a technique to utilize generated images to augment existing datasets. This paper explores various strategies for effective data augmentation to improve the out-of-domain generalization capabilities of deep learning models.

  Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

  Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in improved video generation as quantified by various metrics.

  Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results. You can find our code atthis https URL.

  As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for strongerthis http URLis publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[Locality in Image Diffusion Models Emerges from Data Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09672)**  `arXiv:2509.09672`  `cs.CV`

  Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models, proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior expert-crafted alternative.

  We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods, our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations, respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce: (i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out" realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to partial 2D / 3D observations.

  In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1) Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF) method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data. Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

  _Xiaodong Wang, Ping Wang, Zhangyuan Li, Xin Yuan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

  _Bin Huang, Kang Chen, Bingxuan Li, Huafeng Liu, Qiegen Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource, low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain. ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations. First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over 200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments, ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

  3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses, particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches. Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature. This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon (Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models, finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American people in media professions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs. horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to human-like robustness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training, the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full attention.

  Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique in modern diffusion models for enhancing sample quality and prompt adherence. However, through an empirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we observe a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the ground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions often leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this issue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on this insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic block-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks, effectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and toward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that S^2-Guidance delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and other advanced guidance strategies. Our code will be released.

  Generating highly dynamic and photorealistic portrait animations driven by audio and skeletal motion remains challenging due to the need for precise lip synchronization, natural facial expressions, and high-fidelity body motion dynamics. We propose a human-preference-aligned diffusion framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce direct preference optimization tailored for human-centric animation, leveraging a curated dataset of human preferences to align generated outputs with perceptual metrics for portrait motion-video alignment and naturalness of expression. Second, the proposed temporal motion modulation resolves spatiotemporal resolution mismatches by reshaping motion conditions into dimensionally aligned latent features through temporal channel redistribution and proportional feature expansion, preserving the fidelity of high-frequency motion details in diffusion-based synthesis. The proposed mechanism is complementary to existing UNet and DiT-based portrait diffusion approaches, and experiments demonstrate obvious improvements in lip-audio synchronization, expression vividness, body motion coherence over baseline methods, alongside notable gains in human preference metrics.

  Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of directly aligning diffusion models with human preferences using differentiable reward. However, they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive, thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX model with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.

  Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM, Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.
