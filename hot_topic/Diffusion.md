- **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528)**  `arXiv:2505.11528`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion policies have recently emerged as a powerful class of visuomotor controllers for robot manipulation, offering stable training and expressive multi-modal action modeling. However, existing approaches typically treat action generation as an unconstrained denoising process, ignoring valuable a priori knowledge about geometry and control structure. In this work, we propose the Adaptive Diffusion Policy (ADP), a test-time adaptation method that introduces two key inductive biases into the diffusion. First, we embed a geometric manifold constraint that aligns denoising updates with task-relevant subspaces, leveraging the fact that the relative pose between the end-effector and target scene provides a natural gradient direction, and guiding denoising along the geodesic path of the manipulation manifold. Then, to reduce unnecessary exploration and accelerate convergence, we propose an analytically guided initialization: rather than sampling from an uninformative prior, we compute a rough registration between the gripper and target scenes to propose a structured initial noisy action. ADP is compatible with pre-trained diffusion policies and requires no retraining, enabling test-time adaptation that tailors the policy to specific tasks, thereby enhancing generalization across novel tasks and environments. Experiments on RLBench, CALVIN, and real-world dataset show that ADPro, an implementation of ADP, improves success rates, generalization, and sampling efficiency, achieving up to 25% faster execution and 9% points over strong diffusion baselines.

- **[Latent Policy Barrier: Learning Robust Visuomotor Policies by Staying In-Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05941)**  `arXiv:2508.05941`  `cs.RO`  
  _Zhanyi Sun, Shuran Song_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visuomotor policies trained via behavior cloning are vulnerable to covariate shift, where small deviations from expert trajectories can compound into failure. Common strategies to mitigate this issue involve expanding the training distribution through human-in-the-loop corrections or synthetic data augmentation. However, these approaches are often labor-intensive, rely on strong task assumptions, or compromise the quality of imitation. We introduce Latent Policy Barrier, a framework for robust visuomotor policy learning. Inspired by Control Barrier Functions, LPB treats the latent embeddings of expert demonstrations as an implicit barrier separating safe, in-distribution states from unsafe, out-of-distribution (OOD) ones. Our approach decouples the role of precise expert imitation and OOD recovery into two separate modules: a base diffusion policy solely on expert data, and a dynamics model trained on both expert and suboptimal policy rollout data. At inference time, the dynamics model predicts future latent states and optimizes them to stay within the expert distribution. Both simulated and real-world experiments show that LPB improves both policy robustness and data efficiency, enabling reliable manipulation from limited expert data and without additional human correction or annotation.

- **[Improving Diagnostic Accuracy for Oral Cancer with inpainting Synthesis Lesions Generated Using Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06151)**  `arXiv:2508.06151`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Yong Oh Lee, JeeEun Kim, Jung Woo Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In oral cancer diagnostics, the limited availability of annotated datasets frequently constrains the performance of diagnostic models, particularly due to the variability and insufficiency of training data. To address these challenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy by synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique with a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from multiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images. Our method generated synthetic lesions that exhibit a high degree of visual fidelity to actual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic algorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion locations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic image generation in medical diagnostics and paves the way for further research into extending these methods to other types of cancer diagnostics.

- **[OM2P: Offline Multi-Agent Mean-Flow Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06269)**  `arXiv:2508.06269`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhuoran Li, Xun Wang, Hai Zhong, Longbo Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative models, especially diffusion and flow-based models, have been promising in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, integrating powerful generative models into this framework poses unique challenges. In particular, diffusion and flow-based policies suffer from low sampling efficiency due to their iterative generation processes, making them impractical in time-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. To tackle these difficulties, we propose OM2P (Offline Multi-Agent Mean-Flow Policy), a novel offline MARL algorithm to achieve efficient one-step action sampling. To address the misalignment between generative objectives and reward maximization, we introduce a reward-aware optimization scheme that integrates a carefully-designed mean-flow matching loss with Q-function supervision. Additionally, we design a generalized timestep distribution and a derivative-free estimation strategy to reduce memory overhead and improve training stability. Empirical evaluations on Multi-Agent Particle and MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate that OM2P achieves superior performance, with up to a 3.8x reduction in GPU memory usage and up to a 10.8x speed-up in training time. Our approach represents the first to successfully integrate mean-flow model into offline MARL, paving the way for practical and scalable generative policies in cooperative multi-agent settings.

- **[Learning to Match Unpaired Data with Minimum Entropy Coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08501)**  `arXiv:2503.08501`  `cs.LG`  
  _Mustapha Bounoua, Giulio Franzese, Pietro Michiardi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal data is a precious asset enabling a variety of downstream tasks in machine learning. However, real-world data collected across different modalities is often not paired, which is a significant challenge to learn a joint distribution. A prominent approach to address the modality coupling problem is Minimum Entropy Coupling (MEC), which seeks to minimize the joint Entropy, while satisfying constraints on the marginals. Existing approaches to the MEC problem focus on finite, discrete distributions, limiting their application for cases involving continuous data. In this work, we propose a novel method to solve the continuous MEC problem, using well-known generative diffusion models that learn to approximate and minimize the joint Entropy through a cooperative scheme, while satisfying a relaxed version of the marginal constraints. We empirically demonstrate that our method, DDMEC, is general and can be easily used to address challenging tasks, including unsupervised single-cell multi-omics data alignment and unpaired image translation, outperforming specialized methods.

- **[GMF-Drive: Gated Mamba Fusion with Spatial-Aware BEV Representation for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06113)**  `arXiv:2508.06113`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Jian Wang, Chaokang Jiang, Haitao Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based models are redefining the state-of-the-art in end-to-end autonomous driving, yet their performance is increasingly hampered by a reliance on transformer-based fusion. These architectures face fundamental limitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of high-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from effectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for Driving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two principled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited histogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar format encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical 3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba fusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with a highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM leverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the unique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the challenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component, demonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer in both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discriminative classifiers have become a foundational tool in deep learning for medical imaging, excelling at learning separable features of complex data distributions. However, these models often need careful design, augmentation, and training techniques to ensure safe and reliable deployment. Recently, diffusion models have become synonymous with generative modeling in 2D. These models showcase robustness across a range of tasks including natural image classification, where classification is performed by comparing reconstruction errors across images generated for each possible conditioning input. This work presents the first exploration of the potential of class conditional diffusion models for 2D medical image classification. First, we develop a novel majority voting scheme shown to improve the performance of medical diffusion classifiers. Next, extensive experiments on the CheXpert and ISIC Melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that foundation and trained-from-scratch diffusion models achieve competitive performance against SOTA discriminative classifiers without the need for explicit supervision. In addition, we show that diffusion classifiers are intrinsically explainable, and can be used to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, increasing their trustworthiness and reliability in safety-critical, clinical contexts.

- **[Improved Sub-Visible Particle Classification in Flow Imaging Microscopy via Generative AI-Based Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06021)**  `arXiv:2508.06021`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles. However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure. To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising 500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, atthis https URL.

- **[Improved DDIM Sampling with Moment Matching Gaussian Mixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04938)**  `arXiv:2311.04938`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Prasad Gabbur_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as reverse transition operator (kernel) within the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) framework, which is one of the most widely used approaches for accelerated sampling from pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). Specifically we match the first and second order central moments of the DDPM forward marginals by constraining the parameters of the GMM. We see that moment matching is sufficient to obtain samples with equal or better quality than the original DDIM with Gaussian kernels. We provide experimental results with unconditional models trained on CelebAHQ and FFHQ, class-conditional models trained on ImageNet, and text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion v2.1 on COYO700M datasets respectively. Our results suggest that using the GMM kernel leads to significant improvements in the quality of the generated samples when the number of sampling steps is small, as measured by FID and IS metrics. For example on ImageNet 256x256, using 10 sampling steps, we achieve a FID of 6.94 and IS of 207.85 with a GMM kernel compared to 10.15 and 196.73 respectively with a Gaussian kernel. Further, we derive novel SDE samplers for rectified flow matching models and experiment with the proposed approach. We see improvements using both 1-rectified flow and 2-rectified flow models.

- **[Bifrost-1: Bridging Multimodal LLMs and Diffusion Models with Patch-level CLIP Latents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05954)**  `arXiv:2508.05954`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Han Lin, Jaemin Cho, Amir Zadeh, Chuan Li, Mohit Bansal_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder. These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our design choices.

  Colonoscopy is a vital tool for the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer, which is one of the main causes of cancer-related mortality globally; hence, it is deemed an essential technique for the prevention and early detection of colorectal cancer. The research introduces a unique multidirectional architectural framework to automate polyp detection within colonoscopy images while helping resolve limited healthcare dataset sizes and annotation complexities. The research implements a comprehensive system that delivers synthetic data generation through Stable Diffusion enhancements together with detection and segmentation algorithms. This detection approach combines Faster R-CNN for initial object localization while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) refines the segmentation masks. The faster R-CNN detection algorithm achieved a recall of 93.08% combined with a precision of 88.97% and an F1 score of 90.98%.SAM is then used to generate the image mask. The research evaluated five state-of-the-art segmentation models that included U-Net, PSPNet, FPN, LinkNet, and MANet using ResNet34 as a base model. The results demonstrate the superior performance of FPN with the highest scores of PSNR (7.205893) and SSIM (0.492381), while UNet excels in recall (84.85%) and LinkNet shows balanced performance in IoU (64.20%) and Dice score (77.53%).

  To treat Trochlear Dysplasia (TD), current approaches rely mainly on low-resolution clinical Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans and surgical intuition. The surgeries are planned based on surgeons experience, have limited adoption of minimally invasive techniques, and lead to inconsistent outcomes. We propose a pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy target morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an isotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label custom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to generate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In contrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images, our approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes compatible for pre- and intraoperative use. These can serve as preoperative blueprints for reshaping the femoral groove while preserving the native patella articulation. Furthermore, and in contrast to other work, we do not require a CT for our pipeline - reducing the amount of radiation. We evaluated our approach on 25 TD patients and could show that our target morphologies significantly improve the sulcus angle (SA) and trochlear groove depth (TGD). The code and interactive visualization are available atthis https URL.

- **[A 3DGS-Diffusion Self-Supervised Framework for Normal Estimation from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05950)**  `arXiv:2508.05950`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Yanxing Liang, Yinghui Wang, Jinlong Yang, Wei Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation. Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple metrics.

  Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened concerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or misleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF), a novel task generating standardized garment images from single photos of clothed individuals. Unlike Virtual Try-On (VTON), which digitally dresses models, VTOFF extracts canonical garment images, demanding precise reconstruction of shape, texture, and complex patterns, enabling robust evaluation of generative model fidelity. We propose TryOffDiff, adapting Stable Diffusion with SigLIP-based visual conditioning to deliver high-fidelity reconstructions. Experiments on VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets show that TryOffDiff outperforms adapted pose transfer and VTON baselines. We observe that traditional metrics such as SSIM inadequately reflect reconstruction quality, prompting our use of DISTS for reliable assessment. Our findings highlight VTOFF's potential to improve e-commerce product imagery, advance generative model evaluation, and guide future research on high-fidelity reconstruction.

- **[LightSwitch: Multi-view Relighting with Material-guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06494)**  `arXiv:2508.06494`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yehonathan Litman, Fernando De la Torre, Shubham Tulsiani_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent approaches for 3D relighting have shown promise in integrating 2D image relighting generative priors to alter the appearance of a 3D representation while preserving the underlying structure. Nevertheless, generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.

  _Wenbin Teng, Gonglin Chen, Haiwei Chen, Yajie Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has enabled realistic 3D models from dense image captures, yet challenges persist with sparse views, often leading to artifacts in unseen areas. Recent works leverage Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) to generate dense observations, filling the gaps when only sparse views are available for 3D reconstruction tasks. A significant limitation of these methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel view synthesis using VDMs in as few as four sampling steps. We propose a novel video diffusion model distillation method that distills a multi-step denoising teacher model into a few-step denoising student model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and softened reverse KL-divergence minimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared to previous works, our framework generates the same number of novel views with similar (or even better) visual quality while reducing sampling time by more than 90%. FVGen significantly improves time efficiency for downstream reconstruction tasks, particularly when working with sparse input views (more than 2) where pre-trained VDMs need to be run multiple times to achieve better spatial coverage.

- **[Can Diffusion Models Bridge the Domain Gap in Cardiac MR Imaging?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06327)**  `arXiv:2508.06327`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xin Ci Wong, Duygu Sarikaya, Kieran Zucker, Marc De Kamps, Nishant Ravikumar_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including cardiac MR, is prone to domain shift due to variations in imaging devices and acquisition protocols. This challenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios, where performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve increasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or additional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural consistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in creating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM) trained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that resemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural fidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the segmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in multi-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and vanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where, domain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain data, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the source domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation performance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based metrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on real data alone. The proposed method ameliorates the need for transfer learning or online training to address domain shift challenges in cardiac MR image analysis, especially useful in data-scarce settings.

- **[Fewer Denoising Steps or Cheaper Per-Step Inference: Towards Compute-Optimal Diffusion Model Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06160)**  `arXiv:2508.06160`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhenbang Du, Yonggan Fu, Lifu Wang, Jiayi Qian, Xiao Luo, Yingyan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning, is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff, a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of denoising steps.

- **[DiffCap: Diffusion-based Real-time Human Motion Capture using Sparse IMUs and a Monocular Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06139)**  `arXiv:2508.06139`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Combining sparse IMUs and a monocular camera is a new promising setting to perform real-time human motion capture. This paper proposes a diffusion-based solution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals together seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the characteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is considered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the inertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to construct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that the visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or subjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential visual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the occasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other hand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when signal transmission has no problem. So incorporating them frame-wisely could better explore the temporal information for the system. Experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the system design and its state-of-the-art performance in pose estimation compared with the previous works.

  In the digital age, advanced image editing tools pose a serious threat to the integrity of visual content, making image forgery detection and localization a key research focus. Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods rely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated datasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity, limiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent studies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level annotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches often depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on diffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and CIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data distribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on large-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even under limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding mechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between IML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore, the end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data annotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and 4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method also excels in uncertainty estimation, visualization and robustness.

  Emotion serves as an essential component in daily human interactions. Existing human motion generation frameworks do not consider the impact of emotions, which reduces naturalness and limits their application in interactive tasks, such as human reaction synthesis. In this work, we introduce a novel task: generating diverse reaction motions in response to different emotional cues. However, learning emotion representation from limited motion data and incorporating it into a motion generation framework remains a challenging problem. To address the above obstacles, we introduce a semi-supervised emotion prior in an actor-reactor diffusion model to facilitate emotion-driven reaction synthesis. Specifically, based on the observation that motion clips within a short sequence tend to share the same emotion, we first devise a semi-supervised learning framework to train an emotion prior. With this prior, we further train an actor-reactor diffusion model to generate reactions by considering both spatial interaction and emotional response. Finally, given a motion sequence of an actor, our approach can generate realistic reactions under various emotional conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing reaction generation methods. The code and data will be made publicly available atthis https URL

  Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in few-step video generation.

  Existing methods for human parsing into body parts and clothing often use fixed mask categories with broad labels that obscure fine-grained clothing types. Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but typically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to distinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we propose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts and clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based open-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal representations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe that, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D texture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling stronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum introduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model -- obtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved alignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract human-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate semantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through prompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation maps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone garments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene. We conduct extensive cross-dataset experiments -- separately assessing body parts, clothing parts, unseen clothing categories, and full-body masks -- and demonstrate that Spectrum consistently outperforms baseline methods in prompt-based segmentation.

  Recent advances in novel view synthesis (NVS) have enabled real-time rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods struggle with artifacts and missing regions when rendering from viewpoints that deviate from the training trajectory, limiting seamless scene exploration. To address this, we propose a 3DGS-based pipeline that generates additional training views to enhance reconstruction. We introduce an information-gain-driven virtual camera placement strategy to maximize scene coverage, followed by video diffusion priors to refine rendered results. Fine-tuning 3D Gaussians with these enhanced views significantly improves reconstruction quality. To evaluate our method, we present Wild-Explore, a benchmark designed for challenging scene exploration. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing 3DGS-based methods, enabling high-quality, artifact-free rendering from arbitrary viewpoints.this https URL

  Medical image synthesis is an important topic for both clinical and research applications. Recently, diffusion models have become a leading approach in this area. Despite their strengths, many existing methods struggle with (1) limited generalizability that only work for specific body regions or voxel spacings, (2) slow inference, which is a common issue for diffusion models, and (3) weak alignment with input conditions, which is a critical issue for medical imaging. MAISI, a previously proposed framework, addresses generalizability issues but still suffers from slow inference and limited condition consistency. In this work, we present MAISI-v2, the first accelerated 3D medical image synthesis framework that integrates rectified flow to enable fast and high quality generation. To further enhance condition fidelity, we introduce a novel region-specific contrastive loss to enhance the sensitivity to region of interest. Our experiments show that MAISI-v2 can achieve SOTA image quality with $33 \times$ acceleration for latent diffusion model. We also conducted a downstream segmentation experiment to show that the synthetic images can be used for data augmentation. We release our code, training details, model weights, and a GUI demo to facilitate reproducibility and promote further development within the community.

  Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928 image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography (PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.

  Recent advances in generative AI have revolutionized visual content creation, yet aligning model outputs with human preferences remains a critical challenge. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for fine-tuning generative models, existing methods like DDPO and DPOK face fundamental limitations - particularly their inability to maintain stable optimization when scaling to large and diverse prompt sets, severely restricting their practical utility. This paper presents DanceGRPO, a framework that addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for visual generation tasks. Our key insight is that GRPO's inherent stability mechanisms uniquely position it to overcome the optimization challenges that plague prior RL-based approaches on visual generation. DanceGRPO establishes several significant advances: First, it demonstrates consistent and stable policy optimization across multiple modern generative paradigms, including both diffusion models and rectified flows. Second, it maintains robust performance when scaling to complex, real-world scenarios encompassing three key tasks and four foundation models. Third, it shows remarkable versatility in optimizing for diverse human preferences as captured by five distinct reward models assessing image/video aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary feedback. Our comprehensive experiments reveal that DanceGRPO outperforms baseline methods by up to 181\% across multiple established benchmarks, including HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Our results establish DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis.

  Scene text editing aims to modify or add texts on images while ensuring text fidelity and overall visual quality consistent with the background. Recent methods are primarily built on UNet-based diffusion models, which have improved scene text editing results, but still struggle with complex glyph structures, especially for non-Latin ones (\eg, Chinese, Korean, Japanese). To address these issues, we present \textbf{FLUX-Text}, a simple and advanced multilingual scene text editing DiT method. Specifically, our FLUX-Text enhances glyph understanding and generation through lightweight Visual and Text Embedding Modules, while preserving the original generative capability of FLUX. We further propose a Regional Text Perceptual Loss tailored for text regions, along with a matching two-stage training strategy to better balance text editing and overall image quality. Benefiting from the DiT-based architecture and lightweight feature injection modules, FLUX-Text can be trained with only $0.1$M training examples, a \textbf{97\%} reduction compared to $2.9$M required by popular methods. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets, including English and Chinese benchmarks, demonstrate that our method surpasses other methods in visual quality and text fidelity.

  Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by high computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer, limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states. Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments show that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\mathbf{2.53\times}$ time-to-first-token (TTFT) speedup and $\mathbf{1.88\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on LongBench. Our code will be released upon acceptance.
