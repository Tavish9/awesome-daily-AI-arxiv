  Learning bimanual manipulation is challenging due to its high dimensionality and tight coordination required between two arms. Eye-in-hand imitation learning, which uses wrist-mounted cameras, simplifies perception by focusing on task-relevant views. However, collecting diverse demonstrations remains costly, motivating the need for scalable data augmentation. While prior work has explored visual augmentation in single-arm settings, extending these approaches to bimanual manipulation requires generating viewpoint-consistent observations across both arms and producing corresponding action labels that are both valid and feasible. In this work, we propose Diffusion for COordinated Dual-arm Data Augmentation (D-CODA), a method for offline data augmentation tailored to eye-in-hand bimanual imitation learning that trains a diffusion model to synthesize novel, viewpoint-consistent wrist-camera images for both arms while simultaneously generating joint-space action labels. It employs constrained optimization to ensure that augmented states involving gripper-to-object contacts adhere to constraints suitable for bimanual coordination. We evaluate D-CODA on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2250 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that it outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable data augmentation in eye-in-hand bimanual manipulation.

- **[DiSPo: Diffusion-SSM based Policy Learning for Coarse-to-Fine Action Discretization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14719)**  `arXiv:2409.14719`  `cs.RO`  
  _Nayoung Oh, Jaehyeong Jang, Moonkyeong Jung, Daehyung Park_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We aim to solve the problem of generating coarse-to-fine skills learning from demonstrations (LfD). To scale precision, traditional LfD approaches often rely on extensive fine-grained demonstrations with external interpolations or dynamics models with limited generalization capabilities. For memory-efficient learning and convenient granularity change, we propose a novel diffusion-SSM based policy (DiSPo) that learns from diverse coarse skills and produces varying control scales of actions by leveraging a state-space model, Mamba. Our evaluations show the adoption of Mamba and the proposed step-scaling method enable DiSPo to outperform in three coarse-to-fine benchmark tests with maximum 81% higher success rate than baselines. In addition, DiSPo improves inference efficiency by generating coarse motions in less critical regions. We finally demonstrate the scalability of actions with simulation and real-world manipulation tasks.

- **[Uncertainty Comes for Free: Human-in-the-Loop Policies with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01876)**  `arXiv:2503.01876`  `cs.LG` `cs.RO`  
  _Zhanpeng He, Yifeng Cao, Matei Ciocarlie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human-in-the-loop (HitL) robot deployment has gained significant attention in both academia and industry as a semi-autonomous paradigm that enables human operators to intervene and adjust robot behaviors at deployment time, improving success rates. However, continuous human monitoring and intervention can be highly labor-intensive and impractical when deploying a large number of robots. To address this limitation, we propose a method that allows diffusion policies to actively seek human assistance only when necessary, reducing reliance on constant human oversight. To achieve this, we leverage the generative process of diffusion policies to compute an uncertainty-based metric based on which the autonomous agent can decide to request operator assistance at deployment time, without requiring any operator interaction during training. Additionally, we show that the same method can be used for efficient data collection for fine-tuning diffusion policies in order to improve their autonomous performance. Experimental results from simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that our approach enhances policy performance during deployment for a variety of scenarios.

- **[Research on Anomaly Detection Methods Based on Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05137)**  `arXiv:2505.05137`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly detection is a fundamental task in machine learning and data mining, with significant applications in cybersecurity, industrial fault diagnosis, and clinical disease monitoring. Traditional methods, such as statistical modeling and machine learning-based approaches, often face challenges in handling complex, high-dimensional data distributions. In this study, we explore the potential of diffusion models for anomaly detection, proposing a novel framework that leverages the strengths of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) to effectively identify anomalies in both image and audio data. The proposed method models the distribution of normal data through a diffusion process and reconstructs input data via reverse diffusion, using a combination of reconstruction errors and semantic discrepancies as anomaly indicators. To enhance the framework's performance, we introduce multi-scale feature extraction, attention mechanisms, and wavelet-domain representations, enabling the model to capture fine-grained structures and global dependencies in the data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MVTec AD and UrbanSound8K, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse data modalities. This research highlights the effectiveness of diffusion models in anomaly detection and provides a robust and efficient solution for real-world applications.

- **[Graffe: Graph Representation Learning via Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04956)**  `arXiv:2505.04956`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), widely recognized for their potential to generate high-quality samples, tend to go unnoticed in representation learning. While recent progress has highlighted their potential for capturing visual semantics, adapting DPMs to graph representation learning remains in its infancy. In this paper, we introduce Graffe, a self-supervised diffusion model proposed for graph representation learning. It features a graph encoder that distills a source graph into a compact representation, which, in turn, serves as the condition to guide the denoising process of the diffusion decoder. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we first explore the theoretical foundations of applying diffusion models to representation learning, proving that the denoising objective implicitly maximizes the conditional mutual information between data and its representation. Specifically, we prove that the negative logarithm of the denoising score matching loss is a tractable lower bound for the conditional mutual information. Empirically, we conduct a series of case studies to validate our theoretical insights. In addition, Graffe delivers competitive results under the linear probing setting on node and graph classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 9 of the 11 real-world datasets. These findings indicate that powerful generative models, especially diffusion models, serve as an effective tool for graph representation learning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-Time Series generation holds significant potential to address challenges such as data sparsity, imbalance, and limited availability of multimodal time series datasets across domains. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in Text-to-X (e.g., vision and audio data) generation, their use in time series generation remains in its nascent stages. Existing approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the lack of systematic exploration of general-proposed time series captions, which are often domain-specific and struggle with generalization; and (2) the inability to generate time series of arbitrary lengths, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we first categorize time series captions into three levels: point-level, fragment-level, and instance-level. Additionally, we introduce a new fragment-level dataset containing over 600,000 high-resolution time series-text pairs. Second, we propose Text-to-Series (T2S), a diffusion-based framework that bridges the gap between natural language and time series in a domain-agnostic manner. T2S employs a length-adaptive variational autoencoder to encode time series of varying lengths into consistent latent embeddings. On top of that, T2S effectively aligns textual representations with latent embeddings by utilizing Flow Matching and employing Diffusion Transformer as the denoiser. We train T2S in an interleaved paradigm across multiple lengths, allowing it to generate sequences of any desired length. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that T2S achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 datasets spanning 12 domains.

- **[Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Coastal Inundation Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05381)**  `arXiv:2505.05381`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Coastal flooding poses significant risks to communities, necessitating fast and accurate forecasting methods to mitigate potential damage. To approach this problem, we present DIFF-FLOOD, a probabilistic spatiotemporal forecasting method designed based on denoising diffusion models. DIFF-FLOOD predicts inundation level at a location by taking both spatial and temporal context into account. It utilizes inundation levels at neighboring locations and digital elevation data as spatial context. Inundation history from a context time window, together with additional co-variates are used as temporal context. Convolutional neural networks and cross-attention mechanism are then employed to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics in the data. We trained and tested DIFF-FLOOD on coastal inundation data from the Eastern Shore of Virginia, a region highly impacted by coastal flooding. Our results show that, DIFF-FLOOD outperforms existing forecasting methods in terms of prediction performance (6% to 64% improvement in terms of two performance metrics) and scalability.

- **[Taming OOD Actions for Offline Reinforcement Learning: An Advantage-Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05126)**  `arXiv:2505.05126`  `cs.LG`  
  _Xuyang Chen, Keyu Yan, Lin Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn decision-making policies from fixed datasets without online interactions, providing a practical solution where online data collection is expensive or risky. However, offline RL often suffers from distribution shift, resulting in inaccurate evaluation and substantial overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, existing approaches incorporate conservatism by indiscriminately discouraging all OOD actions, thereby hindering the agent's ability to generalize and exploit beneficial ones. In this paper, we propose Advantage-based Diffusion Actor-Critic (ADAC), a novel method that systematically evaluates OOD actions using the batch-optimal value function. Based on this evaluation, ADAC defines an advantage function to modulate the Q-function update, enabling more precise assessment of OOD action quality. We design a custom PointMaze environment and collect datasets to visually reveal that advantage modulation can effectively identify and select superior OOD actions. Extensive experiments show that ADAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all tasks in the D4RL benchmark, with particularly clear margins on the more challenging tasks.

- **[Lay-Your-Scene: Natural Scene Layout Generation with Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04718)**  `arXiv:2505.04718`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Divyansh Srivastava, Xiang Zhang, He Wen, Chenru Wen, Zhuowen Tu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Lay-Your-Scene (shorthand LayouSyn), a novel text-to-layout generation pipeline for natural scenes. Prior scene layout generation methods are either closed-vocabulary or use proprietary large language models for open-vocabulary generation, limiting their modeling capabilities and broader applicability in controllable image generation. In this work, we propose to use lightweight open-source language models to obtain scene elements from text prompts and a novel aspect-aware diffusion Transformer architecture trained in an open-vocabulary manner for conditional layout generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LayouSyn outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging spatial and numerical reasoning benchmarks. Additionally, we present two applications of LayouSyn. First, we show that coarse initialization from large language models can be seamlessly combined with our method to achieve better results. Second, we present a pipeline for adding objects to images, demonstrating the potential of LayouSyn in image editing applications.

  _Jocelyn Dzuong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent surge in advanced generative models, such as diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs), has led to an alarming rise in AI-generated images across various domains on the web. While such technologies offer benefits such as democratizing artistic creation, they also pose challenges in misinformation, digital forgery, and authenticity verification. Additionally, the uncredited use of AI-generated images in media and marketing has sparked significant backlash from online communities. In response to this, we introduce DejAIvu, a Chrome Web extension that combines real-time AI-generated image detection with saliency-based explainability while users browse the web. Using an ONNX-optimized deep learning model, DejAIvu automatically analyzes images on websites such as Google Images, identifies AI-generated content using model inference, and overlays a saliency heatmap to highlight AI-related artifacts. Our approach integrates efficient in-browser inference, gradient-based saliency analysis, and a seamless user experience, ensuring that AI detection is both transparent and interpretable. We also evaluate DejAIvu across multiple pretrained architectures and benchmark datasets, demonstrating high accuracy and low latency, making it a practical and deployable tool for enhancing AI image accountability.

  Complex 3D scene understanding has gained increasing attention, with scene encoding strategies playing a crucial role in this success. However, the optimal scene encoding strategies for various scenarios remain unclear, particularly compared to their image-based counterparts. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive study that probes various visual encoding models for 3D scene understanding, identifying the strengths and limitations of each model across different scenarios. Our evaluation spans seven vision foundation encoders, including image-based, video-based, and 3D foundation models. We evaluate these models in four tasks: Vision-Language Scene Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Segmentation, and Registration, each focusing on different aspects of scene understanding. Our evaluations yield key findings: DINOv2 demonstrates superior performance, video models excel in object-level tasks, diffusion models benefit geometric tasks, and language-pretrained models show unexpected limitations in language-related tasks. These insights challenge some conventional understandings, provide novel perspectives on leveraging visual foundation models, and highlight the need for more flexible encoder selection in future vision-language and scene-understanding tasks.

  Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) aim to integrate multimodal understanding and generation abilities through a single framework. Despite their versatility, existing open-source unified models exhibit performance gaps against domain-specific architectures. To bridge this gap, we present Nexus-Gen, a unified model that synergizes the language reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the image synthesis power of diffusion models. To align the embedding space of the LLM and diffusion model, we conduct a dual-phase alignment training process. (1) The autoregressive LLM learns to predict image embeddings conditioned on multimodal inputs, while (2) the vision decoder is trained to reconstruct high-fidelity images from these embeddings. During training the LLM, we identified a critical discrepancy between the autoregressive paradigm's training and inference phases, where error accumulation in continuous embedding space severely degrades generation quality. To avoid this issue, we introduce a prefilled autoregression strategy that prefills input sequence with position-embedded special tokens instead of continuous embeddings. Through dual-phase training, Nexus-Gen has developed the integrated capability to comprehensively address the image understanding, generation and editing tasks. All models, datasets, and codes are published atthis https URLto facilitate further advancements across the field.

- **[On Synthetic Texture Datasets: Challenges, Creation, and Curation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10297)**  `arXiv:2409.10297`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Blaine Hoak, Patrick McDaniel_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The influence of textures on machine learning models has been an ongoing investigation, specifically in texture bias/learning, interpretability, and robustness. However, due to the lack of large and diverse texture data available, the findings in these works have been limited, as more comprehensive evaluations have not been feasible. Image generative models are able to provide data creation at scale, but utilizing these models for texture synthesis has been unexplored and poses additional challenges both in creating accurate texture images and validating those images. In this work, we introduce an extensible methodology and corresponding new dataset for generating high-quality, diverse texture images capable of supporting a broad set of texture-based tasks. Our pipeline consists of: (1) developing prompts from a range of descriptors to serve as input to text-to-image models, (2) adopting and adapting Stable Diffusion pipelines to generate and filter the corresponding images, and (3) further filtering down to the highest quality images. Through this, we create the Prompted Textures Dataset (PTD), a dataset of 362,880 texture images that span 56 textures. During the process of generating images, we find that NSFW safety filters in image generation pipelines are highly sensitive to texture (and flag up to 60\% of our texture images), uncovering a potential bias in these models and presenting unique challenges when working with texture data. Through both standard metrics and a human evaluation, we find that our dataset is high quality and diverse. Our dataset is available for download atthis https URL.

- **[SVAD: From Single Image to 3D Avatar via Synthetic Data Generation with Video Diffusion and Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05475)**  `arXiv:2505.05475`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yonwoo Choi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Creating high-quality animatable 3D human avatars from a single image remains a significant challenge in computer vision due to the inherent difficulty of reconstructing complete 3D information from a single viewpoint. Current approaches face a clear limitation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods produce high-quality results but require multiple views or video sequences, while video diffusion models can generate animations from single images but struggle with consistency and identity preservation. We present SVAD, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by leveraging complementary strengths of existing techniques. Our method generates synthetic training data through video diffusion, enhances it with identity preservation and image restoration modules, and utilizes this refined data to train 3DGS avatars. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SVAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-image methods in maintaining identity consistency and fine details across novel poses and viewpoints, while enabling real-time rendering capabilities. Through our data augmentation pipeline, we overcome the dependency on dense monocular or multi-view training data typically required by traditional 3DGS approaches. Extensive quantitative, qualitative comparisons show our method achieves superior performance across multiple metrics against baseline models. By effectively combining the generative power of diffusion models with both the high-quality results and rendering efficiency of 3DGS, our work establishes a new approach for high-fidelity avatar generation from a single image input.

  3D scene generation seeks to synthesize spatially structured, semantically meaningful, and photorealistic environments for applications such as immersive media, robotics, autonomous driving, and embodied AI. Early methods based on procedural rules offered scalability but limited diversity. Recent advances in deep generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) and 3D representations (e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussians) have enabled the learning of real-world scene distributions, improving fidelity, diversity, and view consistency. Recent advances like diffusion models bridge 3D scene synthesis and photorealism by reframing generation as image or video synthesis problems. This survey provides a systematic overview of state-of-the-art approaches, organizing them into four paradigms: procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based generation, and video-based generation. We analyze their technical foundations, trade-offs, and representative results, and review commonly used datasets, evaluation protocols, and downstream applications. We conclude by discussing key challenges in generation capacity, 3D representation, data and annotations, and evaluation, and outline promising directions including higher fidelity, physics-aware and interactive generation, and unified perception-generation models. This review organizes recent advances in 3D scene generation and highlights promising directions at the intersection of generative AI, 3D vision, and embodied intelligence.

- **[DiffusionSfM: Predicting Structure and Motion via Ray Origin and Endpoint Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05473)**  `arXiv:2505.05473`  `cs.CV`  
  _Qitao Zhao, Amy Lin, Jeff Tan, Jason Y. Zhang, Deva Ramanan, Shubham Tulsiani_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, combining learned or geometric pairwise reasoning with a subsequent global optimization step. In contrast, we propose a data-driven multi-view reasoning approach that directly infers 3D scene geometry and camera poses from multi-view images. Our framework, DiffusionSfM, parameterizes scene geometry and cameras as pixel-wise ray origins and endpoints in a global frame and employs a transformer-based denoising diffusion model to predict them from multi-view inputs. To address practical challenges in training diffusion models with missing data and unbounded scene coordinates, we introduce specialized mechanisms that ensure robust learning. We empirically validate DiffusionSfM on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms classical and learning-based approaches while naturally modeling uncertainty.

- **[Mogao: An Omni Foundation Model for Interleaved Multi-Modal Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05472)**  `arXiv:2505.05472`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chao Liao, Liyang Liu, Xun Wang, Zhengxiong Luo, Xinyu Zhang, Wenliang Zhao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent progress in unified models for image understanding and generation has been impressive, yet most approaches remain limited to single-modal generation conditioned on multiple modalities. In this paper, we present Mogao, a unified framework that advances this paradigm by enabling interleaved multi-modal generation through a causal approach. Mogao integrates a set of key technical improvements in architecture design, including a deep-fusion design, dual vision encoders, interleaved rotary position embeddings, and multi-modal classifier-free guidance, which allow it to harness the strengths of both autoregressive models for text generation and diffusion models for high-quality image synthesis. These practical improvements also make Mogao particularly effective to process interleaved sequences of text and images arbitrarily. To further unlock the potential of unified models, we introduce an efficient training strategy on a large-scale, in-house dataset specifically curated for joint text and image generation. Extensive experiments show that Mogao not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal understanding and text-to-image generation, but also excels in producing high-quality, coherent interleaved outputs. Its emergent capabilities in zero-shot image editing and compositional generation highlight Mogao as a practical omni-modal foundation model, paving the way for future development and scaling the unified multi-modal systems.

- **[GeomHair: Reconstruction of Hair Strands from Colorless 3D Scans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05376)**  `arXiv:2505.05376`  `cs.CV`  
  _Rachmadio Noval Lazuardi, Artem Sevastopolsky, Egor Zakharov, Matthias Niessner, Vanessa Sklyarova_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel method that reconstructs hair strands directly from colorless 3D scans by leveraging multi-modal hair orientation extraction. Hair strand reconstruction is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics that can be used for high-fidelity digital avatar synthesis, animation, and AR/VR applications. However, accurately recovering hair strands from raw scan data remains challenging due to human hair's complex and fine-grained structure. Existing methods typically rely on RGB captures, which can be sensitive to the environment and can be a challenging domain for extracting the orientation of guiding strands, especially in the case of challenging hairstyles. To reconstruct the hair purely from the observed geometry, our method finds sharp surface features directly on the scan and estimates strand orientation through a neural 2D line detector applied to the renderings of scan shading. Additionally, we incorporate a diffusion prior trained on a diverse set of synthetic hair scans, refined with an improved noise schedule, and adapted to the reconstructed contents via a scan-specific text prompt. We demonstrate that this combination of supervision signals enables accurate reconstruction of both simple and intricate hairstyles without relying on color information. To facilitate further research, we introduce Strands400, the largest publicly available dataset of hair strands with detailed surface geometry extracted from real-world data, which contains reconstructed hair strands from the scans of 400 subjects.

  Recent success of large text-to-image models has empirically underscored the exceptional performance of diffusion models in generative tasks. To facilitate their efficient deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, model quantization has emerged as a pivotal technique for both compression and acceleration. This survey offers a thorough review of the latest advancements in diffusion model quantization, encapsulating and analyzing the current state of the art in this rapidly advancing domain. First, we provide an overview of the key challenges encountered in the quantization of diffusion models, including those based on U-Net architectures and Diffusion Transformers (DiT). We then present a comprehensive taxonomy of prevalent quantization techniques, engaging in an in-depth discussion of their underlying principles. Subsequently, we perform a meticulous analysis of representative diffusion model quantization schemes from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. From a quantitative standpoint, we rigorously benchmark a variety of methods using widely recognized datasets, delivering an extensive evaluation of the most recent and impactful research in the field. From a qualitative standpoint, we categorize and synthesize the effects of quantization errors, elucidating these impacts through both visual analysis and trajectory examination. In conclusion, we outline prospective avenues for future research, proposing novel directions for the quantization of generative models in practical applications.

- **[EAM: Enhancing Anything with Diffusion Transformers for Blind Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05209)**  `arXiv:2505.05209`  `cs.CV`  
  _Haizhen Xie, Kunpeng Du, Qiangyu Yan, Sen Lu, Jianhong Han, Hanting Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Utilizing pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models to guide Blind Super-Resolution (BSR) has become a predominant approach in the field. While T2I models have traditionally relied on U-Net architectures, recent advancements have demonstrated that Diffusion Transformers (DiT) achieve significantly higher performance in this domain. In this work, we introduce Enhancing Anything Model (EAM), a novel BSR method that leverages DiT and outperforms previous U-Net-based approaches. We introduce a novel block, $\Psi$-DiT, which effectively guides the DiT to enhance image restoration. This block employs a low-resolution latent as a separable flow injection control, forming a triple-flow architecture that effectively leverages the prior knowledge embedded in the pre-trained DiT. To fully exploit the prior guidance capabilities of T2I models and enhance their generalization in BSR, we introduce a progressive Masked Image Modeling strategy, which also reduces training costs. Additionally, we propose a subject-aware prompt generation strategy that employs a robust multi-modal model in an in-context learning framework. This strategy automatically identifies key image areas, provides detailed descriptions, and optimizes the utilization of T2I diffusion priors. Our experiments demonstrate that EAM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

- **[MDE-Edit: Masked Dual-Editing for Multi-Object Image Editing via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05101)**  `arXiv:2505.05101`  `cs.CV`  
  _Hongyang Zhu, Haipeng Liu, Bo Fu, Yang Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-object editing aims to modify multiple objects or regions in complex scenes while preserving structural coherence. This task faces significant challenges in scenarios involving overlapping or interacting objects: (1) Inaccurate localization of target objects due to attention misalignment, leading to incomplete or misplaced edits; (2) Attribute-object mismatch, where color or texture changes fail to align with intended regions due to cross-attention leakage, creating semantic conflicts (\textit{e.g.}, color bleeding into non-target areas). Existing methods struggle with these challenges: approaches relying on global cross-attention mechanisms suffer from attention dilution and spatial interference between objects, while mask-based methods fail to bind attributes to geometrically accurate regions due to feature entanglement in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, inference-stage optimization approach that enables precise localized image manipulation in complex multi-object scenes, named MDE-Edit. MDE-Edit optimizes the noise latent feature in diffusion models via two key losses: Object Alignment Loss (OAL) aligns multi-layer cross-attention with segmentation masks for precise object positioning, and Color Consistency Loss (CCL) amplifies target attribute attention within masks while suppressing leakage to adjacent regions. This dual-loss design ensures localized and coherent multi-object edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDE-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing accuracy and visual quality, offering a robust solution for complex multi-object image manipulation tasks.

  Text-to-image generation for personalized identities aims at incorporating the specific identity into images using a text prompt and an identity image. Based on the powerful generative capabilities of DDPMs, many previous works adopt additional prompts, such as text embeddings and CLIP image embeddings, to represent the identity information, while they fail to disentangle the identity information and background information. As a result, the generated images not only lose key identity characteristics but also suffer from significantly reduced diversity. To address this issue, previous works have combined the W+ space from StyleGAN with diffusion models, leveraging this space to provide a more accurate and comprehensive representation of identity features through multi-level feature extraction. However, the entanglement of identity and background information in in-the-wild images during training prevents accurate identity localization, resulting in severe semantic interference between identity and background. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-tuning-based diffusion model for personalized identities text-to-image generation, named PIDiff, which leverages the W+ space and an identity-tailored fine-tuning strategy to avoid semantic entanglement and achieves accurate feature extraction and localization. Style editing can also be achieved by PIDiff through preserving the characteristics of identity features in the W+ space, which vary from coarse to fine. Through the combination of the proposed cross-attention block and parameter optimization strategy, PIDiff preserves the identity information and maintains the generation capability for in-the-wild images of the pre-trained model during inference. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method in this task.

  Creating animatable 3D avatars from a single image remains challenging due to style limitations (realistic, cartoon, anime) and difficulties in handling accessories or hairstyles. While 3D diffusion models advance single-view reconstruction for general objects, outputs often lack animation controls or suffer from artifacts because of the domain gap. We propose SOAP, a style-omniscient framework to generate rigged, topology-consistent avatars from any portrait. Our method leverages a multiview diffusion model trained on 24K 3D heads with multiple styles and an adaptive optimization pipeline to deform the FLAME mesh while maintaining topology and rigging via differentiable rendering. The resulting textured avatars support FACS-based animation, integrate with eyeballs and teeth, and preserve details like braided hair or accessories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art techniques for both single-view head modeling and diffusion-based generation of Image-to-3D.

  Bilingual text-to-motion generation, which synthesizes 3D human motions from bilingual text inputs, holds immense potential for cross-linguistic applications in gaming, film, and robotics. However, this task faces critical challenges: the absence of bilingual motion-language datasets and the misalignment between text and motion distributions in diffusion models, leading to semantically inconsistent or low-quality motions. To address these challenges, we propose BiHumanML3D, a novel bilingual human motion dataset, which establishes a crucial benchmark for bilingual text-to-motion generation models. Furthermore, we propose a Bilingual Motion Diffusion model (BiMD), which leverages cross-lingual aligned representations to capture semantics, thereby achieving a unified bilingual model. Building upon this, we propose Reward-guided sampling Alignment (ReAlign) method, comprising a step-aware reward model to assess alignment quality during sampling and a reward-guided strategy that directs the diffusion process toward an optimally aligned distribution. This reward model integrates step-aware tokens and combines a text-aligned module for semantic consistency and a motion-aligned module for realism, refining noisy motions at each timestep to balance probability density and alignment. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves text-motion alignment and motion quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Project page:this https URL.

  Synthesizing medical images remains challenging due to limited annotated pathological data, modality domain gaps, and the complexity of representing diffuse pathologies such as liver cirrhosis. Existing methods often struggle to maintain anatomical fidelity while accurately modeling pathological features, frequently relying on priors derived from natural images or inefficient multi-step sampling. In this work, we introduce ViCTr (Vital Consistency Transfer), a novel two-stage framework that combines a rectified flow trajectory with a Tweedie-corrected diffusion process to achieve high-fidelity, pathology-aware image synthesis. First, we pretrain ViCTr on the ATLAS-8k dataset using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to preserve critical anatomical structures. We then fine-tune the model adversarially with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules for precise control over pathology severity. By reformulating Tweedie's formula within a linear trajectory framework, ViCTr supports one-step sampling, reducing inference from 50 steps to just 4, without sacrificing anatomical realism. We evaluate ViCTr on BTCV (CT), AMOS (MRI), and CirrMRI600+ (cirrhosis) datasets. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a Medical Frechet Inception Distance (MFID) of 17.01 for cirrhosis synthesis 28% lower than existing approaches and improving nnUNet segmentation by +3.8% mDSC when used for data augmentation. Radiologist reviews indicate that ViCTr-generated liver cirrhosis MRIs are clinically indistinguishable from real scans. To our knowledge, ViCTr is the first method to provide fine-grained, pathology-aware MRI synthesis with graded severity control, closing a critical gap in AI-driven medical imaging research.

  Scene text editing, a subfield of image editing, requires modifying texts in images while preserving style consistency and visual coherence with the surrounding environment. While diffusion-based methods have shown promise in text generation, they still struggle to produce high-quality results. These methods often generate distorted or unrecognizable characters, particularly when dealing with complex characters like Chinese. In such systems, characters are composed of intricate stroke patterns and spatial relationships that must be precisely maintained. We present GlyphMastero, a specialized glyph encoder designed to guide the latent diffusion model for generating texts with stroke-level precision. Our key insight is that existing methods, despite using pretrained OCR models for feature extraction, fail to capture the hierarchical nature of text structures - from individual strokes to stroke-level interactions to overall character-level structure. To address this, our glyph encoder explicitly models and captures the cross-level interactions between local-level individual characters and global-level text lines through our novel glyph attention module. Meanwhile, our model implements a feature pyramid network to fuse the multi-scale OCR backbone features at the global-level. Through these cross-level and multi-scale fusions, we obtain more detailed glyph-aware guidance, enabling precise control over the scene text generation process. Our method achieves an 18.02\% improvement in sentence accuracy over the state-of-the-art multi-lingual scene text editing baseline, while simultaneously reducing the text-region Fr√©chet inception distance by 53.28\%.

  Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in universal image restoration. While existing methods speed up inference by reducing sampling steps, substantial step intervals often introduce cumulative errors. Moreover, they struggle to balance the commonality of degradation representations and restoration quality. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{DGSolver}, a diffusion generalist solver with universal posterior sampling. We first derive the exact ordinary differential equations for generalist diffusion models and tailor high-order solvers with a queue-based accelerated sampling strategy to improve both accuracy and efficiency. We then integrate universal posterior sampling to better approximate manifold-constrained gradients, yielding a more accurate noise estimation and correcting errors in inverse inference. Extensive experiments show that DGSolver outperforms state-of-the-art methods in restoration accuracy, stability, and scalability, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code and models will be available atthis https URL.

  Realistic simulation of dynamic scenes requires accurately capturing diverse material properties and modeling complex object interactions grounded in physical principles. However, existing methods are constrained to basic material types with limited predictable parameters, making them insufficient to represent the complexity of real-world materials. We introduce PhysFlow, a novel approach that leverages multi-modal foundation models and video diffusion to achieve enhanced 4D dynamic scene simulation. Our method utilizes multi-modal models to identify material types and initialize material parameters through image queries, while simultaneously inferring 3D Gaussian splats for detailed scene representation. We further refine these material parameters using video diffusion with a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) and optical flow guidance rather than render loss or Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. This integrated framework enables accurate prediction and realistic simulation of dynamic interactions in real-world scenarios, advancing both accuracy and flexibility in physics-based simulations.

  The creation of complex 3D scenes tailored to user specifications has been a tedious and challenging task with traditional 3D modeling tools. Although some pioneering methods have achieved automatic text-to-3D generation, they are generally limited to small-scale scenes with restricted control over the shape and texture. We introduce SceneCraft, a novel method for generating detailed indoor scenes that adhere to textual descriptions and spatial layout preferences provided by users. Central to our method is a rendering-based technique, which converts 3D semantic layouts into multi-view 2D proxy maps. Furthermore, we design a semantic and depth conditioned diffusion model to generate multi-view images, which are used to learn a neural radiance field (NeRF) as the final scene representation. Without the constraints of panorama image generation, we surpass previous methods in supporting complicated indoor space generation beyond a single room, even as complicated as a whole multi-bedroom apartment with irregular shapes and layouts. Through experimental analysis, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in complex indoor scene generation with diverse textures, consistent geometry, and realistic visual quality.

  In this work, we tackle the task of learning 3D human Gaussians from a single image, focusing on recovering detailed appearance and geometry including unobserved regions. We introduce a single-view generalizable Human Gaussian Model (HGM), which employs a novel generate-then-refine pipeline with the guidance from human body prior and diffusion prior. Our approach uses a ControlNet to refine rendered back-view images from coarse predicted human Gaussians, then uses the refined image along with the input image to reconstruct refined human Gaussians. To mitigate the potential generation of unrealistic human poses and shapes, we incorporate human priors from the SMPL-X model as a dual branch, propagating image features from the SMPL-X volume to the image Gaussians using sparse convolution and attention mechanisms. Given that the initial SMPL-X estimation might be inaccurate, we gradually refine it with our HGM model. We validate our approach on several publicly available datasets. Our method surpasses previous methods in both novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction. Our approach also exhibits strong generalization for cross-dataset evaluation and in-the-wild images.

  Training fall detection systems is challenging due to the scarcity of real-world fall data, particularly from elderly individuals. To address this, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating synthetic fall data. This study evaluates text-to-motion (T2M, SATO, ParCo) and text-to-text models (GPT4o, GPT4, Gemini) in simulating realistic fall scenarios. We generate synthetic datasets and integrate them with four real-world baseline datasets to assess their impact on fall detection performance using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Additionally, we compare LLM-generated synthetic data with a diffusion-based method to evaluate their alignment with real accelerometer distributions. Results indicate that dataset characteristics significantly influence the effectiveness of synthetic data, with LLM-generated data performing best in low-frequency settings (e.g., 20Hz) while showing instability in high-frequency datasets (e.g., 200Hz). While text-to-motion models produce more realistic biomechanical data than text-to-text models, their impact on fall detection varies. Diffusion-based synthetic data demonstrates the closest alignment to real data but does not consistently enhance model performance. An ablation study further confirms that the effectiveness of synthetic data depends on sensor placement and fall representation. These findings provide insights into optimizing synthetic data generation for fall detection models.

  Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to convert spoken input in one language to spoken output in another, typically focusing on either language translation or accent adaptation. However, effective cross-cultural communication requires handling both aspects simultaneously - translating content while adapting the speaker's accent to match the target language context. In this work, we propose a unified approach for simultaneous speech translation and change of accent, a task that remains underexplored in current literature. Our method reformulates the problem as a conditional generation task, where target speech is generated based on phonemes and guided by target speech features. Leveraging the power of diffusion models, known for high-fidelity generative capabilities, we adapt text-to-image diffusion strategies by conditioning on source speech transcriptions and generating Mel spectrograms representing the target speech with desired linguistic and accentual attributes. This integrated framework enables joint optimization of translation and accent adaptation, offering a more parameter-efficient and effective model compared to traditional pipelines.
