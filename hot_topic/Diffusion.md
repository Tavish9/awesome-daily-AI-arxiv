- **[Unified World Models: Coupling Video and Action Diffusion for Pretraining on Large Robotic Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02792)**  `arXiv:2504.02792`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach towards building generalist robots. However, scaling imitation learning for large robot foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality expert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation. In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. By controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

- **[Dynamic Manipulation of Deformable Objects in 3D: Simulation, Benchmark and Learning Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17434)**  `arXiv:2505.17434`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Guanzhou Lan, Yuqi Yang, Anup Teejo Mathew, Feiping Nie, Rong Wang, Xuelong Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Goal-conditioned dynamic manipulation is inherently challenging due to complex system dynamics and stringent task constraints, particularly in deformable object scenarios characterized by high degrees of freedom and underactuation. Prior methods often simplify the problem to low-speed or 2D settings, limiting their applicability to real-world 3D tasks. In this work, we explore 3D goal-conditioned rope manipulation as a representative challenge. To mitigate data scarcity, we introduce a novel simulation framework and benchmark grounded in reduced-order dynamics, which enables compact state representation and facilitates efficient policy learning. Building on this, we propose Dynamics Informed Diffusion Policy (DIDP), a framework that integrates imitation pretraining with physics-informed test-time adaptation. First, we design a diffusion policy that learns inverse dynamics within the reduced-order space, enabling imitation learning to move beyond na√Øve data fitting and capture the underlying physical structure. Second, we propose a physics-informed test-time adaptation scheme that imposes kinematic boundary conditions and structured dynamics priors on the diffusion process, ensuring consistency and reliability in manipulation execution. Extensive experiments validate the proposed approach, demonstrating strong performance in terms of accuracy and robustness in the learned policy.

- **[What Do You Need for Diverse Trajectory Stitching in Diffusion Planning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18083)**  `arXiv:2505.18083`  `cs.LG` `cs.RO`  
  _Quentin Clark, Florian Shkurti_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In planning, stitching is an ability of algorithms to piece together sub-trajectories of data they are trained on to generate new and diverse behaviours. While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling. Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition, both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable generalization in goal-conditioned settings.

- **[Towards more transferable adversarial attack in black-box manner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18097)**  `arXiv:2505.18097`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Chun Tong Lei, Zhongliang Guo, Hon Chung Lee, Minh Quoc Duong, Chun Pong Lau_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adversarial attacks have become a well-explored domain, frequently serving as evaluation baselines for model robustness. Among these, black-box attacks based on transferability have received significant attention due to their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. Traditional black-box methods have generally focused on improving the optimization framework (e.g., utilizing momentum in MI-FGSM) to enhance transferability, rather than examining the dependency on surrogate white-box model architectures. Recent state-of-the-art approach DiffPGD has demonstrated enhanced transferability by employing diffusion-based adversarial purification models for adaptive attacks. The inductive bias of diffusion-based adversarial purification aligns naturally with the adversarial attack process, where both involving noise addition, reducing dependency on surrogate white-box model selection. However, the denoising process of diffusion models incurs substantial computational costs through chain rule derivation, manifested in excessive VRAM consumption and extended runtime. This progression prompts us to question whether introducing diffusion models is necessary. We hypothesize that a model sharing similar inductive bias to diffusion-based adversarial purification, combined with an appropriate loss function, could achieve comparable or superior transferability while dramatically reducing computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function coupled with a unique surrogate model to validate our hypothesis. Our approach leverages the score of the time-dependent classifier from classifier-guided diffusion models, effectively incorporating natural data distribution knowledge into the adversarial optimization process. Experimental results demonstrate significantly improved transferability across diverse model architectures while maintaining robustness against diffusion-based defenses.

- **[Erasing Undesirable Concepts in Diffusion Models with Adversarial Preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15618)**  `arXiv:2410.15618`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Anh Bui, Long Vuong, Khanh Doan, Trung Le, Paul Montague, Tamas Abraham, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models excel at generating visually striking content from text but can inadvertently produce undesirable or harmful content when trained on unfiltered internet data. A practical solution is to selectively removing target concepts from the model, but this may impact the remaining concepts. Prior approaches have tried to balance this by introducing a loss term to preserve neutral content or a regularization term to minimize changes in the model parameters, yet resolving this trade-off remains challenging. In this work, we propose to identify and preserving concepts most affected by parameter changes, termed as \textit{adversarial concepts}. This approach ensures stable erasure with minimal impact on the other concepts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using the Stable Diffusion model, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods in eliminating unwanted content while maintaining the integrity of other unrelated elements. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Fantastic Targets for Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models and Where To Find Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18950)**  `arXiv:2501.18950`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Anh Bui, Trang Vu, Long Vuong, Trung Le, Paul Montague, Tamas Abraham, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Concept erasure has emerged as a promising technique for mitigating the risk of harmful content generation in diffusion models by selectively unlearning undesirable concepts. The common principle of previous works to remove a specific concept is to map it to a fixed generic concept, such as a neutral concept or just an empty text prompt. In this paper, we demonstrate that this fixed-target strategy is suboptimal, as it fails to account for the impact of erasing one concept on the others. To address this limitation, we model the concept space as a graph and empirically analyze the effects of erasing one concept on the remaining concepts. Our analysis uncovers intriguing geometric properties of the concept space, where the influence of erasing a concept is confined to a local region. Building on this insight, we propose the Adaptive Guided Erasure (AGE) method, which \emph{dynamically} selects optimal target concepts tailored to each undesirable concept, minimizing unintended side effects. Experimental results show that AGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods on preserving unrelated concepts while maintaining effective erasure performance.

- **[FLEX: A Backbone for Diffusion-Based Modeling of Spatio-temporal Physical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17351)**  `arXiv:2505.17351`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _N. Benjamin Erichson, Vinicius Mikuni, Dongwei Lyu, Yang Gao, Omri Azencot, Soon Hoe Lim, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce FLEX (FLow EXpert), a backbone architecture for generative modeling of spatio-temporal physical systems using diffusion models. FLEX operates in the residual space rather than on raw data, a modeling choice that we motivate theoretically, showing that it reduces the variance of the velocity field in the diffusion model, which helps stabilize training. FLEX integrates a latent Transformer into a U-Net with standard convolutional ResNet layers and incorporates a redesigned skip connection scheme. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both local spatial detail and long-range dependencies in latent space. To improve spatio-temporal conditioning, FLEX uses a task-specific encoder that processes auxiliary inputs such as coarse or past snapshots. Weak conditioning is applied to the shared encoder via skip connections to promote generalization, while strong conditioning is applied to the decoder through both skip and bottleneck features to ensure reconstruction fidelity. FLEX achieves accurate predictions for super-resolution and forecasting tasks using as few as two reverse diffusion steps. It also produces calibrated uncertainty estimates through sampling. Evaluations on high-resolution 2D turbulence data show that FLEX outperforms strong baselines and generalizes to out-of-distribution settings, including unseen Reynolds numbers, physical observables (e.g., fluid flow velocity fields), and boundary conditions.

- **[Diffusion Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05364)**  `arXiv:2410.05364`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Guangyao Zhou, Sivaramakrishnan Swaminathan, Rajkumar Vasudeva Raju, J. Swaroop Guntupalli, Wolfgang Lehrach, Joseph Ortiz, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Diffusion Model Predictive Control (D-MPC), a novel MPC approach that learns a multi-step action proposal and a multi-step dynamics model, both using diffusion models, and combines them for use in online MPC. On the popular D4RL benchmark, we show performance that is significantly better than existing model-based offline planning methods using MPC (e.g. MBOP) and competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods. We additionally illustrate D-MPC's ability to optimize novel reward functions at run time and adapt to novel dynamics, and highlight its advantages compared to existing diffusion-based planning baselines.

- **[Strictly Constrained Generative Modeling via Split Augmented Langevin Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18017)**  `arXiv:2505.18017`  `cs.LG`  
  _Matthieu Blanke, Yongquan Qu, Sara Shamekh, Pierre Gentine_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep generative models hold great promise for representing complex physical systems, but their deployment is currently limited by the lack of guarantees on the physical plausibility of the generated outputs. Ensuring that known physical constraints are enforced is therefore critical when applying generative models to scientific and engineering problems. We address this limitation by developing a principled framework for sampling from a target distribution while rigorously satisfying physical constraints. Leveraging the variational formulation of Langevin dynamics, we propose Split Augmented Langevin (SAL), a novel primal-dual sampling algorithm that enforces constraints progressively through variable splitting, with convergence guarantees. While the method is developed theoretically for Langevin dynamics, we demonstrate its effective applicability to diffusion models. In particular, we use constrained diffusion models to generate physical fields satisfying energy and mass conservation laws. We apply our method to diffusion-based data assimilation on a complex physical system, where enforcing physical constraints substantially improves both forecast accuracy and the preservation of critical conserved quantities. We also demonstrate the potential of SAL for challenging feasibility problems in optimal control.

- **[Multiphysics Bench: Benchmarking and Investigating Scientific Machine Learning for Multiphysics PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17575)**  `arXiv:2505.17575`  `cs.LG`  
  _Changfan Yang, Lichen Bai, Yinpeng Wang, Shufei Zhang, Zeke Xie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with machine learning has recently attracted great attention, as PDEs are fundamental tools for modeling real-world systems that range from fundamental physical science to advanced engineering disciplines. Most real-world physical systems across various disciplines are actually involved in multiple coupled physical fields rather than a single field. However, previous machine learning studies mainly focused on solving single-field problems, but overlooked the importance and characteristics of multiphysics problems in real world. Multiphysics PDEs typically entail multiple strongly coupled variables, thereby introducing additional complexity and challenges, such as inter-field coupling. Both benchmarking and solving multiphysics problems with machine learning remain largely unexamined. To identify and address the emerging challenges in multiphysics problems, we mainly made three contributions in this work. First, we collect the first general multiphysics dataset, the Multiphysics Bench, that focuses on multiphysics PDE solving with machine learning. Multiphysics Bench is also the most comprehensive PDE dataset to date, featuring the broadest range of coupling types, the greatest diversity of PDE formulations, and the largest dataset scale. Second, we conduct the first systematic investigation on multiple representative learning-based PDE solvers, such as PINNs, FNO, DeepONet, and DiffusionPDE solvers, on multiphysics problems. Unfortunately, naively applying these existing solvers usually show very poor performance for solving multiphysics. Third, through extensive experiments and discussions, we report multiple insights and a bag of useful tricks for solving multiphysics with machine learning, motivating future directions in the study and simulation of complex, coupled physical systems.

- **[Spacetime Geometry of Denoising in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17517)**  `arXiv:2505.17517`  `cs.LG`  
  _Rafa≈Ç Karczewski, Markus Heinonen, Alison Pouplin, S√∏ren Hauberg, Vikas Garg_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel perspective on diffusion models using the framework of information geometry. We show that the set of noisy samples, taken across all noise levels simultaneously, forms a statistical manifold -- a family of denoising probability distributions. Interpreting the noise level as a temporal parameter, we refer to this manifold as spacetime. This manifold naturally carries a Fisher-Rao metric, which defines geodesics -- shortest paths between noisy points. Notably, this family of distributions is exponential, enabling efficient geodesic computation even in high-dimensional settings without retraining or fine-tuning. We demonstrate the practical value of this geometric viewpoint in transition path sampling, where spacetime geodesics define smooth sequences of Boltzmann distributions, enabling the generation of continuous trajectories between low-energy metastable states.

- **[Self-supervised Multi-future Occupancy Forecasting for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21126)**  `arXiv:2407.21126`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Environment prediction frameworks are critical for the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in dynamic settings. LiDAR-generated occupancy grid maps (L-OGMs) offer a robust bird's-eye view for the scene representation, enabling self-supervised joint scene predictions while exhibiting resilience to partial observability and perception detection failures. Prior approaches have focused on deterministic L-OGM prediction architectures within the grid cell space. While these methods have seen some success, they frequently produce unrealistic predictions and fail to capture the stochastic nature of the environment. Additionally, they do not effectively integrate additional sensor modalities present in AVs. Our proposed framework, Latent Occupancy Prediction (LOPR), performs stochastic L-OGM prediction in the latent space of a generative architecture and allows for conditioning on RGB cameras, maps, and planned trajectories. We decode predictions using either a single-step decoder, which provides high-quality predictions in real-time, or a diffusion-based batch decoder, which can further refine the decoded frames to address temporal consistency issues and reduce compression losses. Our experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets show that all variants of our approach qualitatively and quantitatively outperform prior approaches.

- **[Harnessing EHRs for Diffusion-based Anomaly Detection on Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17311)**  `arXiv:2505.17311`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) in medical imaging is crucial for identifying pathological abnormalities without requiring extensive labeled data. However, existing diffusion-based UAD models rely solely on imaging features, limiting their ability to distinguish between normal anatomical variations and pathological anomalies. To address this, we propose Diff3M, a multi-modal diffusion-based framework that integrates chest X-rays and structured Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for enhanced anomaly detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel image-EHR cross-attention module to incorporate structured clinical context into the image generation process, improving the model's ability to differentiate normal from abnormal features. Additionally, we develop a static masking strategy to enhance the reconstruction of normal-like images from anomalies. Extensive evaluations on CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR/IV demonstrate that Diff3M achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing UAD methods in medical imaging.

- **[Scaling Image and Video Generation via Test-Time Evolutionary Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17618)**  `arXiv:2505.17618`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  As the marginal cost of scaling computation (data and parameters) during model pre-training continues to increase substantially, test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising direction for improving generative model performance by allocating additional computation at inference time. While TTS has demonstrated significant success across multiple language tasks, there remains a notable gap in understanding the test-time scaling behaviors of image and video generative models (diffusion-based or flow-based models). Although recent works have initiated exploration into inference-time strategies for vision tasks, these approaches face critical limitations: being constrained to task-specific domains, exhibiting poor scalability, or falling into reward over-optimization that sacrifices sample diversity. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Evo}lutionary \textbf{Search} (EvoSearch), a novel, generalist, and efficient TTS method that effectively enhances the scalability of both image and video generation across diffusion and flow models, without requiring additional training or model expansion. EvoSearch reformulates test-time scaling for diffusion and flow models as an evolutionary search problem, leveraging principles from biological evolution to efficiently explore and refine the denoising trajectory. By incorporating carefully designed selection and mutation mechanisms tailored to the stochastic differential equation denoising process, EvoSearch iteratively generates higher-quality offspring while preserving population diversity. Through extensive evaluation across both diffusion and flow architectures for image and video generation tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieves higher diversity, and shows strong generalizability to unseen evaluation metrics.

- **[RoHyDR: Robust Hybrid Diffusion Recovery for Incomplete Multimodal Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17501)**  `arXiv:2505.17501`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Yuehan Jin, Xiaoqing Liu, Yiyuan Yang, Zhiwen Yu, Tong Zhang, Kaixiang Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal emotion recognition analyzes emotions by combining data from multiple sources. However, real-world noise or sensor failures often cause missing or corrupted data, creating the Incomplete Multimodal Emotion Recognition (IMER) challenge. In this paper, we propose Robust Hybrid Diffusion Recovery (RoHyDR), a novel framework that performs missing-modality recovery at unimodal, multimodal, feature, and semantic levels. For unimodal representation recovery of missing modalities, RoHyDR exploits a diffusion-based generator to generate distribution-consistent and semantically aligned representations from Gaussian noise, using available modalities as conditioning. For multimodal fusion recovery, we introduce adversarial learning to produce a realistic fused multimodal representation and recover missing semantic content. We further propose a multi-stage optimization strategy that enhances training stability and efficiency. In contrast to previous work, the hybrid diffusion and adversarial learning-based recovery mechanism in RoHyDR allows recovery of missing information in both unimodal representation and multimodal fusion, at both feature and semantic levels, effectively mitigating performance degradation caused by suboptimal optimization. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two widely used multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art IMER methods, achieving robust recognition performance under various missing-modality scenarios. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

- **[REG: Rectified Gradient Guidance for Conditional Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18865)**  `arXiv:2501.18865`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Zhengqi Gao, Kaiwen Zha, Tianyuan Zhang, Zihui Xue, Duane S. Boning_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Guidance techniques are simple yet effective for improving conditional generation in diffusion models. Albeit their empirical success, the practical implementation of guidance diverges significantly from its theoretical motivation. In this paper, we reconcile this discrepancy by replacing the scaled marginal distribution target, which we prove theoretically invalid, with a valid scaled joint distribution objective. Additionally, we show that the established guidance implementations are approximations to the intractable optimal solution under no future foresight constraint. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose rectified gradient guidance (REG), a versatile enhancement designed to boost the performance of existing guidance methods. Experiments on 1D and 2D demonstrate that REG provides a better approximation to the optimal solution than prior guidance techniques, validating the proposed theoretical framework. Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation tasks show that incorporating REG consistently improves FID and Inception/CLIP scores across various settings compared to its absence.

- **[RestoreVAR: Visual Autoregressive Generation for All-in-One Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18047)**  `arXiv:2505.18047`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Sudarshan Rajagopalan, Kartik Narayan, Vishal M. Patel_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The use of latent diffusion models (LDMs) such as Stable Diffusion has significantly improved the perceptual quality of All-in-One image Restoration (AiOR) methods, while also enhancing their generalization capabilities. However, these LDM-based frameworks suffer from slow inference due to their iterative denoising process, rendering them impractical for time-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose RestoreVAR, a novel generative approach for AiOR that significantly outperforms LDM-based models in restoration performance while achieving over $\mathbf{10\times}$ faster inference. RestoreVAR leverages visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), a recently introduced approach which performs scale-space autoregression for image generation. VAR achieves comparable performance to that of state-of-the-art diffusion transformers with drastically reduced computational costs. To optimally exploit these advantages of VAR for AiOR, we propose architectural modifications and improvements, including intricately designed cross-attention mechanisms and a latent-space refinement module, tailored for the AiOR task. Extensive experiments show that RestoreVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance among generative AiOR methods, while also exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.

- **[DiffusionReward: Enhancing Blind Face Restoration through Reward Feedback Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17910)**  `arXiv:2505.17910`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Bin Wu, Wei Wang, Yahui Liu, Zixiang Li, Yao Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reward Feedback Learning (ReFL) has recently shown great potential in aligning model outputs with human preferences across various generative tasks. In this work, we introduce a ReFL framework, named DiffusionReward, to the Blind Face Restoration task for the first time. DiffusionReward effectively overcomes the limitations of diffusion-based methods, which often fail to generate realistic facial details and exhibit poor identity consistency. The core of our framework is the Face Reward Model (FRM), which is trained using carefully annotated data. It provides feedback signals that play a pivotal role in steering the optimization process of the restoration network. In particular, our ReFL framework incorporates a gradient flow into the denoising process of off-the-shelf face restoration methods to guide the update of model parameters. The guiding gradient is collaboratively determined by three aspects: (i) the FRM to ensure the perceptual quality of the restored faces; (ii) a regularization term that functions as a safeguard to preserve generative diversity; and (iii) a structural consistency constraint to maintain facial fidelity. Furthermore, the FRM undergoes dynamic optimization throughout the process. It not only ensures that the restoration network stays precisely aligned with the real face manifold, but also effectively prevents reward hacking. Experiments on synthetic and wild datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving identity consistency and facial details.

- **[Slot-MLLM: Object-Centric Visual Tokenization for Multimodal LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17726)**  `arXiv:2505.17726`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Donghwan Chi, Hyomin Kim, Yoonjin Oh, Yongjin Kim, Donghoon Lee, Daejin Jo, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a key approach in achieving artificial general intelligence. In particular, vision-language MLLMs have been developed to generate not only text but also visual outputs from multimodal inputs. This advancement requires efficient image tokens that LLMs can process effectively both in input and output. However, existing image tokenization methods for MLLMs typically capture only global abstract concepts or uniformly segmented image patches, restricting MLLMs' capability to effectively understand or generate detailed visual content, particularly at the object level. To address this limitation, we propose an object-centric visual tokenizer based on Slot Attention specifically for MLLMs. In particular, based on the Q-Former encoder, diffusion decoder, and residual vector quantization, our proposed discretized slot tokens can encode local visual details while maintaining high-level semantics, and also align with textual data to be integrated seamlessly within a unified next-token prediction framework of LLMs. The resulting Slot-MLLM demonstrates significant performance improvements over baselines with previous visual tokenizers across various vision-language tasks that entail local detailed comprehension and generation. Notably, this work is the first demonstration of the feasibility of object-centric slot attention performed with MLLMs and in-the-wild natural images.

- **[Model Already Knows the Best Noise: Bayesian Active Noise Selection via Attention in Video Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17561)**  `arXiv:2505.17561`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Kwanyoung Kim, Sanghyun Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The choice of initial noise significantly affects the quality and prompt alignment of video diffusion models, where different noise seeds for the same prompt can lead to drastically different generations. While recent methods rely on externally designed priors such as frequency filters or inter-frame smoothing, they often overlook internal model signals that indicate which noise seeds are inherently preferable. To address this, we propose ANSE (Active Noise Selection for Generation), a model-aware framework that selects high-quality noise seeds by quantifying attention-based uncertainty. At its core is BANSA (Bayesian Active Noise Selection via Attention), an acquisition function that measures entropy disagreement across multiple stochastic attention samples to estimate model confidence and consistency. For efficient inference-time deployment, we introduce a Bernoulli-masked approximation of BANSA that enables score estimation using a single diffusion step and a subset of attention layers. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B and 5B demonstrate that ANSE improves video quality and temporal coherence with only an 8% and 13% increase in inference time, respectively, providing a principled and generalizable approach to noise selection in video diffusion.

  _Maria-Teresa De Rosa Palmini, Eva Cetinic_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent historical contexts remains largely underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic and reproducible methodology for evaluating how TTI systems depict different historical periods. For this purpose, we introduce the HistVis dataset, a curated collection of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three state-of-the-art diffusion models using carefully designed prompts depicting universal human activities across different historical periods. We evaluate generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras; (2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible demographic patterns. By offering a scalable methodology and benchmark for assessing historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an initial step toward building more historically accurate and culturally aligned TTI models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Controllable video generation (CVG) has advanced rapidly, yet current systems falter when more than one actor must move, interact, and exchange positions under noisy control signals. We address this gap with DanceTogether, the first end-to-end diffusion framework that turns a single reference image plus independent pose-mask streams into long, photorealistic videos while strictly preserving every identity. A novel MaskPoseAdapter binds "who" and "how" at every denoising step by fusing robust tracking masks with semantically rich-but noisy-pose heat-maps, eliminating the identity drift and appearance bleeding that plague frame-wise pipelines. To train and evaluate at scale, we introduce (i) PairFS-4K, 26 hours of dual-skater footage with 7,000+ distinct IDs, (ii) HumanRob-300, a one-hour humanoid-robot interaction set for rapid cross-domain transfer, and (iii) TogetherVideoBench, a three-track benchmark centered on the DanceTogEval-100 test suite covering dance, boxing, wrestling, yoga, and figure skating. On TogetherVideoBench, DanceTogether outperforms the prior arts by a significant margin. Moreover, we show that a one-hour fine-tune yields convincing human-robot videos, underscoring broad generalization to embodied-AI and HRI tasks. Extensive ablations confirm that persistent identity-action binding is critical to these gains. Together, our model, datasets, and benchmark lift CVG from single-subject choreography to compositionally controllable, multi-actor interaction, opening new avenues for digital production, simulation, and embodied intelligence.

  Open-set image segmentation poses a significant challenge because existing methods often demand extensive training or fine-tuning and generally struggle to segment unified objects consistently across diverse text reference expressions. Motivated by this, we propose Segment Anyword, a novel training-free visual concept prompt learning approach for open-set language grounded segmentation that relies on token-level cross-attention maps from a frozen diffusion model to produce segmentation surrogates or mask prompts, which are then refined into targeted object masks. Initial prompts typically lack coherence and consistency as the complexity of the image-text increases, resulting in suboptimal mask fragments. To tackle this issue, we further introduce a novel linguistic-guided visual prompt regularization that binds and clusters visual prompts based on sentence dependency and syntactic structural information, enabling the extraction of robust, noise-tolerant mask prompts, and significant improvements in segmentation accuracy. The proposed approach is effective, generalizes across different open-set segmentation tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art results of 52.5 (+6.8 relative) mIoU on Pascal Context 59, 67.73 (+25.73 relative) cIoU on gRefCOCO, and 67.4 (+1.1 relative to fine-tuned methods) mIoU on GranDf, which is the most complex open-set grounded segmentation task in the field.

  Understanding visual scenes is fundamental to human intelligence. While discriminative models have significantly advanced computer vision, they often struggle with compositional understanding. In contrast, recent generative text-to-image diffusion models excel at synthesizing complex scenes, suggesting inherent compositional capabilities. Building on this, zero-shot diffusion classifiers have been proposed to repurpose diffusion models for discriminative tasks. While prior work offered promising results in discriminative compositional scenarios, these results remain preliminary due to a small number of benchmarks and a relatively shallow analysis of conditions under which the models succeed. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of the discriminative capabilities of diffusion classifiers on a wide range of compositional tasks. Specifically, our study covers three diffusion models (SD 1.5, 2.0, and, for the first time, 3-m) spanning 10 datasets and over 30 tasks. Further, we shed light on the role that target dataset domains play in respective performance; to isolate the domain effects, we introduce a new diagnostic benchmark Self-Bench comprised of images created by diffusion models themselves. Finally, we explore the importance of timestep weighting and uncover a relationship between domain gap and timestep sensitivity, particularly for SD3-m. To sum up, diffusion classifiers understand compositionality, but conditions apply! Code and dataset are available atthis https URL.

  Data augmentation is widely used to train deep learning models to address data scarcity. However, traditional data augmentation (TDA) typically relies on simple geometric transformation, such as random rotation and rescaling, resulting in minimal data diversity enrichment and limited model performance improvement. State-of-the-art generative models for 3D shape generation rely on the denoising diffusion probabilistic models and manage to generate realistic novel point clouds for 3D content creation and manipulation. Nevertheless, the generated 3D shapes lack associated point-wise semantic labels, restricting their usage in enlarging the training data for point cloud segmentation tasks. To bridge the gap between data augmentation techniques and the advanced diffusion models, we extend the state-of-the-art 3D diffusion model, Lion, to a part-aware generative model that can generate high-quality point clouds conditioned on given segmentation masks. Leveraging the novel generative model, we introduce a 3-step generative data augmentation (GDA) pipeline for point cloud segmentation training. Our GDA approach requires only a small amount of labeled samples but enriches the training data with generated variants and pseudo-labeled samples, which are validated by a novel diffusion-based pseudo-label filtering method. Extensive experiments on two large-scale synthetic datasets and a real-world medical dataset demonstrate that our GDA method outperforms TDA approach and related semi-supervised and self-supervised methods.

  Diffusion-based scene text synthesis has progressed rapidly, yet existing methods commonly rely on additional visual conditioning modules and require large-scale annotated data to support multilingual generation. In this work, we revisit the necessity of complex auxiliary modules and further explore an approach that simultaneously ensures glyph accuracy and achieves high-fidelity scene integration, by leveraging diffusion models' inherent capabilities for contextual reasoning. To this end, we introduce TextFlux, a DiT-based framework that enables multilingual scene text synthesis. The advantages of TextFlux can be summarized as follows: (1) OCR-free model architecture. TextFlux eliminates the need for OCR encoders (additional visual conditioning modules) that are specifically used to extract visual text-related features. (2) Strong multilingual scalability. TextFlux is effective in low-resource multilingual settings, and achieves strong performance in newly added languages with fewer than 1,000 samples. (3) Streamlined training setup. TextFlux is trained with only 1% of the training data required by competing methods. (4) Controllable multi-line text generation. TextFlux offers flexible multi-line synthesis with precise line-level control, outperforming methods restricted to single-line or rigid layouts. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that TextFlux outperforms previous methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

  While recent advances in image editing have enabled impressive visual synthesis capabilities, current methods remain constrained by explicit textual instructions and limited editing operations, lacking deep comprehension of implicit user intentions and contextual reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new image editing paradigm: reasoning-guided generative editing, which synthesizes images based on complex, multi-faceted textual queries accepting world knowledge and intention inference. To facilitate this task, we first construct a comprehensive dataset featuring over 1,000 image-instruction-edit triples that incorporate rich reasoning contexts and real-world knowledge. We then propose R-Genie: a reasoning-guided generative image editor, which synergizes the generation power of diffusion models with advanced reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models. R-Genie incorporates a reasoning-attention mechanism to bridge linguistic understanding with visual synthesis, enabling it to handle intricate editing requests involving abstract user intentions and contextual reasoning relations. Extensive experimental results validate that R-Genie can equip diffusion models with advanced reasoning-based editing capabilities, unlocking new potentials for intelligent image synthesis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safety-critical scenarios are rare yet pivotal for evaluating and enhancing the robustness of autonomous driving systems. While existing methods generate safety-critical driving trajectories, simulations, or single-view videos, they fall short of meeting the demands of advanced end-to-end autonomous systems (E2E AD), which require real-world, multi-view video data. To bridge this gap, we introduce SafeMVDrive, the first framework designed to generate high-quality, safety-critical, multi-view driving videos grounded in real-world domains. SafeMVDrive strategically integrates a safety-critical trajectory generator with an advanced multi-view video generator. To tackle the challenges inherent in this integration, we first enhance scene understanding ability of the trajectory generator by incorporating visual context -- which is previously unavailable to such generator -- and leveraging a GRPO-finetuned vision-language model to achieve more realistic and context-aware trajectory generation. Second, recognizing that existing multi-view video generators struggle to render realistic collision events, we introduce a two-stage, controllable trajectory generation mechanism that produces collision-evasion trajectories, ensuring both video quality and safety-critical fidelity. Finally, we employ a diffusion-based multi-view video generator to synthesize high-quality safety-critical driving videos from the generated trajectories. Experiments conducted on an E2E AD planner demonstrate a significant increase in collision rate when tested with our generated data, validating the effectiveness of SafeMVDrive in stress-testing planning modules.

  Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have achieved significant success in point cloud generation, enabling numerous downstream applications, such as generative data augmentation and 3D model editing. However, little attention has been given to generating point clouds with point-wise segmentation labels, as well as to developing evaluation metrics for this task. Therefore, in this paper, we present SeaLion, a novel diffusion model designed to generate high-quality and diverse point clouds with fine-grained segmentation labels. Specifically, we introduce the semantic part-aware latent point diffusion technique, which leverages the intermediate features of the generative models to jointly predict the noise for perturbed latent points and associated part segmentation labels during the denoising process, and subsequently decodes the latent points to point clouds conditioned on part segmentation labels. To effectively evaluate the quality of generated point clouds, we introduce a novel point cloud pairwise distance calculation method named part-aware Chamfer distance (p-CD). This method enables existing metrics, such as 1-NNA, to measure both the local structural quality and inter-part coherence of generated point clouds. Experiments on the large-scale synthetic dataset ShapeNet and real-world medical dataset IntrA demonstrate that SeaLion achieves remarkable performance in generation quality and diversity, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art model, DiffFacto, by 13.33% and 6.52% on 1-NNA (p-CD) across the two datasets. Experimental analysis shows that SeaLion can be trained semi-supervised, thereby reducing the demand for labeling efforts. Lastly, we validate the applicability of SeaLion in generative data augmentation for training segmentation models and the capability of SeaLion to serve as a tool for part-aware 3D shape editing.

  Despite the impressive performance of generative Diffusion Models (DMs), their internal working is still not well understood, which is potentially problematic. This paper focuses on exploring the important notion of bias-variance tradeoff in diffusion models. Providing a systematic foundation for this exploration, it establishes that at one extreme the diffusion models may amplify the inherent bias in the training data and, on the other, they may compromise the presumed privacy of the training samples. Our exploration aligns with the memorization-generalization understanding of the generative models, but it also expands further along this spectrum beyond ``generalization'', revealing the risk of bias amplification in deeper models. Building on the insights, we also introduce a training-free method to improve output quality in text-to-image and image-to-image generation. By progressively encouraging temporary high variance in the generation process with partial bypassing of the mid-block's contribution in the denoising process of DMs, our method consistently improves generative image quality with zero training cost. Our claims are validated both theoretically and empirically.

  Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have significantly enhanced the quality of generated videos. However, their ability to produce explicit or harmful content raises concerns about misuse and potential rights violations. Inspired by the success of unlearning techniques in erasing undesirable concepts from text-to-image (T2I) models, we extend unlearning to T2V models and propose a robust and precise unlearning method. Specifically, we adopt negatively-guided velocity prediction fine-tuning and enhance it with prompt augmentation to ensure robustness against LLM-refined prompts. To achieve precise unlearning, we incorporate a localization and a preservation regularization to preserve the model's ability to generate non-target concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively erases a specific concept while preserving the model's generation capability for all other concepts, outperforming existing methods. We provide the unlearned models in \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

  Generating high resolution 3D shapes using volumetric representations such as Signed Distance Functions presents substantial computational and memory challenges. We introduce Direct3D S2, a scalable 3D generation framework based on sparse volumes that achieves superior output quality with dramatically reduced training costs. Our key innovation is the Spatial Sparse Attention mechanism, which greatly enhances the efficiency of Diffusion Transformer computations on sparse volumetric data. SSA allows the model to effectively process large token sets within sparse volumes, significantly reducing computational overhead and achieving a 3.9x speedup in the forward pass and a 9.6x speedup in the backward pass. Our framework also includes a variational autoencoder that maintains a consistent sparse volumetric format across input, latent, and output stages. Compared to previous methods with heterogeneous representations in 3D VAE, this unified design significantly improves training efficiency and stability. Our model is trained on public available datasets, and experiments demonstrate that Direct3D S2 not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generation quality and efficiency, but also enables training at 1024 resolution using only 8 GPUs, a task typically requiring at least 32 GPUs for volumetric representations at 256 resolution, thus making gigascale 3D generation both practical and accessible.

  Recent monocular metric depth estimation (MMDE) methods have made notable progress towards zero-shot generalization. However, they still exhibit a significant performance drop on out-of-distribution datasets. We address this limitation by injecting defocus blur cues at inference time into Marigold, a \textit{pre-trained} diffusion model for zero-shot, scale-invariant monocular depth estimation (MDE). Our method effectively turns Marigold into a metric depth predictor in a training-free manner. To incorporate defocus cues, we capture two images with a small and a large aperture from the same viewpoint. To recover metric depth, we then optimize the metric depth scaling parameters and the noise latents of Marigold at inference time using gradients from a loss function based on the defocus-blur image formation model. We compare our method against existing state-of-the-art zero-shot MMDE methods on a self-collected real dataset, showing quantitative and qualitative improvements.

  Diffusion models have emerged as leading generative models for images and other modalities, but aligning their outputs with human preferences and safety constraints remains a critical challenge. This thesis proposal investigates methods to align diffusion models using reinforcement learning (RL) and reward modeling. We survey recent advances in fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models with human feedback, including reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback, direct preference optimization, and differentiable reward approaches. We classify these methods based on the type of feedback (human, automated, binary or ranked preferences), the fine-tuning technique (policy gradient, reward-weighted likelihood, direct backpropagation, etc.), and their efficiency and safety outcomes. We compare key algorithms and frameworks, highlighting how they improve alignment with user intent or safety standards, and discuss inter-relationships such as how newer methods build on or diverge from earlier ones. Based on the survey, we identify five promising research directions for the next two years: (1) multi-objective alignment with combined rewards, (2) efficient human feedback usage and active learning, (3) robust safety alignment against adversarial inputs, (4) continual and online alignment of diffusion models, and (5) interpretable and trustworthy reward modeling for generative images. Each direction is elaborated with its problem statement, challenges, related work, and a proposed research plan. The proposal is organized as a comprehensive document with literature review, comparative tables of methods, and detailed research plans, aiming to contribute new insights and techniques for safer and value-aligned diffusion-based generative AI.

  Temporal modeling on regular respiration-induced motions is crucial to image-guided clinical applications. Existing methods cannot simulate temporal motions unless high-dose imaging scans including starting and ending frames exist simultaneously. However, in the preoperative data acquisition stage, the slight movement of patients may result in dynamic backgrounds between the first and last frames in a respiratory period. This additional deviation can hardly be removed by image registration, thus affecting the temporal modeling. To address that limitation, we pioneeringly simulate the regular motion process via the image-to-video (I2V) synthesis framework, which animates with the first frame to forecast future frames of a given length. Besides, to promote the temporal consistency of animated videos, we devise the Temporal Differential Diffusion Model to generate temporal differential fields, which measure the relative differential representations between adjacent frames. The prompt attention layer is devised for fine-grained differential fields, and the field augmented layer is adopted to better interact these fields with the I2V framework, promoting more accurate temporal variation of synthesized videos. Extensive results on ACDC cardiac and 4D Lung datasets reveal that our approach simulates 4D videos along the intrinsic motion trajectory, rivaling other competitive methods on perceptual similarity and temporal consistency. Codes will be available soon.

  Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved text-to-face generation, but achieving fine-grained control over facial features remains a challenge. Existing methods often require training additional modules to handle specific controls such as identity, attributes, or age, making them inflexible and resource-intensive. We propose ExpertGen, a training-free framework that leverages pre-trained expert models such as face recognition, facial attribute recognition, and age estimation networks to guide generation with fine control. Our approach uses a latent consistency model to ensure realistic and in-distribution predictions at each diffusion step, enabling accurate guidance signals to effectively steer the diffusion process. We show qualitatively and quantitatively that expert models can guide the generation process with high precision, and multiple experts can collaborate to enable simultaneous control over diverse facial aspects. By allowing direct integration of off-the-shelf expert models, our method transforms any such model into a plug-and-play component for controllable face generation.

  Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve a wide range of tasks requiring visual reasoning. In real-world scenarios, desirable properties for VLMs include fast inference and controllable generation (e.g., constraining outputs to adhere to a desired format). However, existing autoregressive (AR) VLMs like LLaVA struggle in these aspects. Discrete diffusion models (DMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling parallel decoding for faster inference and bidirectional context for controllable generation through text-infilling. While effective in language-only settings, DMs' potential for multimodal tasks is underexplored. We introduce LaViDa, a family of VLMs built on DMs. We build LaViDa by equipping DMs with a vision encoder and jointly fine-tune the combined parts for multimodal instruction following. To address challenges encountered, LaViDa incorporates novel techniques such as complementary masking for effective training, prefix KV cache for efficient inference, and timestep shifting for high-quality sampling. Experiments show that LaViDa achieves competitive or superior performance to AR VLMs on multi-modal benchmarks such as MMMU, while offering unique advantages of DMs, including flexible speed-quality tradeoff, controllability, and bidirectional reasoning. On COCO captioning, LaViDa surpasses Open-LLaVa-Next-8B by +4.1 CIDEr with 1.92x speedup. On bidirectional tasks, it achieves +59% improvement on Constrained Poem Completion. These results demonstrate LaViDa as a strong alternative to AR VLMs. Code and models will be released in the camera-ready version.

  Generating photorealistic driving videos has seen significant progress recently, but current methods largely focus on ordinary, non-adversarial scenarios. Meanwhile, efforts to generate adversarial driving scenarios often operate on abstract trajectory or BEV representations, falling short of delivering realistic sensor data that can truly stress-test autonomous driving (AD) systems. In this work, we introduce Challenger, a framework that produces physically plausible yet photorealistic adversarial driving videos. Generating such videos poses a fundamental challenge: it requires jointly optimizing over the space of traffic interactions and high-fidelity sensor observations. Challenger makes this affordable through two techniques: (1) a physics-aware multi-round trajectory refinement process that narrows down candidate adversarial maneuvers, and (2) a tailored trajectory scoring function that encourages realistic yet adversarial behavior while maintaining compatibility with downstream video synthesis. As tested on the nuScenes dataset, Challenger generates a diverse range of aggressive driving scenarios-including cut-ins, sudden lane changes, tailgating, and blind spot intrusions-and renders them into multiview photorealistic videos. Extensive evaluations show that these scenarios significantly increase the collision rate of state-of-the-art end-to-end AD models (UniAD, VAD, SparseDrive, and DiffusionDrive), and importantly, adversarial behaviors discovered for one model often transfer to others.

  Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis. Yet, their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution, quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out inference overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs, with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3$B $\sim14$B, show that QVGen is the first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings. Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our 3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and $+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.

  Synthesizing medical images remains challenging due to limited annotated pathological data, modality domain gaps, and the complexity of representing diffuse pathologies such as liver cirrhosis. Existing methods often struggle to maintain anatomical fidelity while accurately modeling pathological features, frequently relying on priors derived from natural images or inefficient multi-step sampling. In this work, we introduce ViCTr (Vital Consistency Transfer), a novel two-stage framework that combines a rectified flow trajectory with a Tweedie-corrected diffusion process to achieve high-fidelity, pathology-aware image synthesis. First, we pretrain ViCTr on the ATLAS-8k dataset using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to preserve critical anatomical structures. We then fine-tune the model adversarially with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules for precise control over pathology severity. By reformulating Tweedie's formula within a linear trajectory framework, ViCTr supports one-step sampling, reducing inference from 50 steps to just 4, without sacrificing anatomical realism. We evaluate ViCTr on BTCV (CT), AMOS (MRI), and CirrMRI600+ (cirrhosis) datasets. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a Medical Frechet Inception Distance (MFID) of 17.01 for cirrhosis synthesis 28% lower than existing approaches and improving nnUNet segmentation by +3.8% mDSC when used for data augmentation. Radiologist reviews indicate that ViCTr-generated liver cirrhosis MRIs are clinically indistinguishable from real scans. To our knowledge, ViCTr is the first method to provide fine-grained, pathology-aware MRI synthesis with graded severity control, closing a critical gap in AI-driven medical imaging research.

  Recent advances in image generation, particularly diffusion models, have significantly lowered the barrier for creating sophisticated forgeries, making image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) increasingly challenging. While prior work in IMDL has focused largely on natural images, the anime domain remains underexplored-despite its growing vulnerability to AI-generated forgeries. Misrepresentations of AI-generated images as hand-drawn artwork, copyright violations, and inappropriate content modifications pose serious threats to the anime community and industry. To address this gap, we propose AnimeDL-2M, the first large-scale benchmark for anime IMDL with comprehensive annotations. It comprises over two million images including real, partially manipulated, and fully AI-generated samples. Experiments indicate that models trained on existing IMDL datasets of natural images perform poorly when applied to anime images, highlighting a clear domain gap between anime and natural images. To better handle IMDL tasks in anime domain, we further propose AniXplore, a novel model tailored to the visual characteristics of anime imagery. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AniXplore achieves superior performance compared to existing methods. Dataset and code can be found inthis https URL.

  Text-driven 3D indoor scene generation is useful for gaming, the film industry, and AR/VR applications. However, existing methods cannot faithfully capture the room layout, nor do they allow flexible editing of individual objects in the room. To address these problems, we present Ctrl-Room, which can generate convincing 3D rooms with designer-style layouts and high-fidelity textures from just a text prompt. Moreover, Ctrl-Room enables versatile interactive editing operations such as resizing or moving individual furniture items. Our key insight is to separate the modeling of layouts and appearance. Our proposed method consists of two stages: a Layout Generation Stage and an Appearance Generation Stage. The Layout Generation Stage trains a text-conditional diffusion model to learn the layout distribution with our holistic scene code parameterization. Next, the Appearance Generation Stage employs a fine-tuned ControlNet to produce a vivid panoramic image of the room guided by the 3D scene layout and text prompt. We thus achieve a high-quality 3D room generation with convincing layouts and lively textures. Benefiting from the scene code parameterization, we can easily edit the generated room model through our mask-guided editing module, without expensive edit-specific training. Extensive experiments on the Structured3D dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in producing more reasonable, view-consistent, and editable 3D rooms from natural language prompts.

  The rapid progress in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) generation has created an urgent need for interpretable automatic evaluation methods that can assess the quality of generated images, therefore reducing the human annotation burden. To reduce the prohibitive cost of relying on commercial models for large-scale evaluation, and to improve the reasoning capabilities of open-source models, recent research has explored supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as dedicated T2I evaluators. However, SFT approaches typically rely on high-quality critique datasets, which are either generated by proprietary LLMs-with potential issues of bias and inconsistency-or annotated by humans at high cost, limiting their scalability and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-Eval-R1, a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains open-source MLLMs using only coarse-grained quality scores, thereby avoiding the need for annotating high-quality interpretable evaluation rationale. Our approach integrates Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the instruction-tuning process, enabling models to generate both scalar scores and interpretable reasoning chains with only easy accessible annotated judgment scores or preferences. Furthermore, we introduce a continuous reward formulation that encourages score diversity and provides stable optimization signals, leading to more robust and discriminative evaluation behavior. Experimental results on three established T2I meta-evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that T2I-Eval-R1 achieves significantly higher alignment with human assessments and offers more accurate interpretable score rationales compared to strong baseline methods.
