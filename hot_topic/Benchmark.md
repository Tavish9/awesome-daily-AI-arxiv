- **[DEIO: Deep Event Inertial Odometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03928)**  `arXiv:2411.03928`  `cs.RO`  
  _Weipeng Guan, Fuling Lin, Peiyu Chen, Peng Lu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Event cameras show great potential for visual odometry (VO) in handling challenging situations, such as fast motion and high dynamic range. Despite this promise, the sparse and motion-dependent characteristics of event data continue to limit the performance of feature-based or direct-based data association methods in practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose Deep Event Inertial Odometry (DEIO), the first monocular learning-based event-inertial framework, which combines a learning-based method with traditional nonlinear graph-based optimization. Specifically, an event-based recurrent network is adopted to provide accurate and sparse associations of event patches over time. DEIO further integrates it with the IMU to recover up-to-scale pose and provide robust state estimation. The Hessian information derived from the learned differentiable bundle adjustment (DBA) is utilized to optimize the co-visibility factor graph, which tightly incorporates event patch correspondences and IMU pre-integration within a keyframe-based sliding window. Comprehensive validations demonstrate that DEIO achieves superior performance on \textit{10} challenging public benchmarks compared with more than 20 state-of-the-art methods.

  Multi-agent systems represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, enabling complex problem-solving through coordinated specialized agents. However, these systems face fundamental challenges in context management, coordination efficiency, and scalable operation. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for advancing multi-agent systems through Model Context Protocol (MCP), addressing these challenges through standardized context sharing and coordination mechanisms. We extend previous work on AI agent architectures by developing a unified theoretical foundation, advanced context management techniques, and scalable coordination patterns. Through detailed implementation case studies across enterprise knowledge management, collaborative research, and distributed problem-solving domains, we demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to traditional approaches. Our evaluation methodology provides a systematic assessment framework with benchmark tasks and datasets specifically designed for multi-agent systems. We identify current limitations, emerging research opportunities, and potential transformative applications across industries. This work contributes to the evolution of more capable, collaborative, and context-aware artificial intelligence systems that can effectively address complex real-world challenges.

  Video games have served as useful benchmarks for the decision-making community, but going beyond Atari games towards modern games has been prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of the research community. Prior work in modern video games typically relied on game-specific integration to obtain game features and enable online training, or on existing large datasets. An alternative approach is to train agents using imitation learning to play video games purely from images. However, this setting poses a fundamental question: which visual encoders obtain representations that retain information critical for decision making? To answer this question, we conduct a systematic study of imitation learning with publicly available pre-trained visual encoders compared to the typical task-specific end-to-end training approach in Minecraft, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Minecraft Dungeons. Our results show that end-to-end training can be effective with comparably low-resolution images and only minutes of demonstrations, but significant improvements can be gained by utilising pre-trained encoders such as DINOv2 depending on the game. In addition to enabling effective decision making, we show that pre-trained encoders can make decision-making research in video games more accessible by significantly reducing the cost of training.

- **[Token-Level Prompt Mixture with Parameter-Free Routing for Federated Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21063)**  `arXiv:2504.21063`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated domain generalization (FedDG) aims to learn a globally generalizable model from decentralized clients with heterogeneous data while preserving privacy. Recent studies have introduced prompt learning to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) in FedDG by learning a single global prompt. However, such a one-prompt-fits-all learning paradigm typically leads to performance degradation on personalized samples. Although the mixture of experts (MoE) offers a promising solution for specialization, existing MoE-based methods suffer from coarse image-level expert assignment and high communication costs from parameterized routers. To address these limitations, we propose TRIP, a Token-level prompt mixture with parameter-free routing framework for FedDG, which treats multiple prompts as distinct experts. Unlike existing image-level routing designs, TRIP assigns different tokens within an image to specific experts. To ensure communication efficiency, TRIP incorporates a parameter-free routing mechanism based on token clustering and optimal transport. The instance-specific prompt is then synthesized by aggregating experts, weighted by the number of tokens assigned to each. Additionally, TRIP develops an unbiased learning strategy for prompt experts, leveraging the VLM's zero-shot generalization capability. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that TRIP achieves optimal generalization results, with communication of only 1K parameters per round. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Masked Generative Priors Improve World Models Sequence Modelling Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07836)**  `arXiv:2410.07836`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the leading approach for creating artificial agents in complex environments. Model-based approaches, which are RL methods with world models that predict environment dynamics, are among the most promising directions for improving data efficiency, forming a critical step toward bridging the gap between research and real-world deployment. In particular, world models enhance sample efficiency by learning in imagination, which involves training a generative sequence model of the environment in a self-supervised manner. Recently, Masked Generative Modelling has emerged as a more efficient and superior inductive bias for modelling and generating token sequences. Building on the Efficient Stochastic Transformer-based World Models (STORM) architecture, we replace the traditional MLP prior with a Masked Generative Prior (e.g., MaskGIT Prior) and introduce GIT-STORM. We evaluate our model on two downstream tasks: reinforcement learning and video prediction. GIT-STORM demonstrates substantial performance gains in RL tasks on the Atari 100k benchmark. Moreover, we apply Transformer-based World Models to continuous action environments for the first time, addressing a significant gap in prior research. To achieve this, we employ a state mixer function that integrates latent state representations with actions, enabling our model to handle continuous control tasks. We validate this approach through qualitative and quantitative analyses on the DeepMind Control Suite, showcasing the effectiveness of Transformer-based World Models in this new domain. Our results highlight the versatility and efficacy of the MaskGIT dynamics prior, paving the way for more accurate world models and effective RL policies.

- **[Historically Relevant Event Structuring for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10621)**  `arXiv:2405.10621`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Jinchuan Zhang, Ming Sun, Chong Mu, Jinhao Zhang, Quanjiang Guo, Ling Tian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning focuses on predicting events through historical information within snapshots distributed on a timeline. Existing studies mainly concentrate on two perspectives of leveraging the history of TKGs, including capturing evolution of each recent snapshot or correlations among global historical facts. Despite the achieved significant accomplishments, these models still fall short of I) investigating the impact of multi-granular interactions across recent snapshots, and II) harnessing the expressive semantics of significant links accorded with queries throughout the entire history, particularly events exerting a profound impact on the future. These inadequacies restrict representation ability to reflect historical dependencies and future trends thoroughly. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an innovative TKG reasoning approach towards \textbf{His}torically \textbf{R}elevant \textbf{E}vents \textbf{S}tructuring (HisRES). Concretely, HisRES comprises two distinctive modules excelling in structuring historically relevant events within TKGs, including a multi-granularity evolutionary encoder that captures structural and temporal dependencies of the most recent snapshots, and a global relevance encoder that concentrates on crucial correlations among events relevant to queries from the entire history. Furthermore, HisRES incorporates a self-gating mechanism for adaptively merging multi-granularity recent and historically relevant structuring representations. Extensive experiments on four event-based benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of HisRES and indicate the superiority and effectiveness of structuring historical relevance for TKG reasoning.

- **[Graph Synthetic Out-of-Distribution Exposure with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21198)**  `arXiv:2504.21198`  `cs.LG`  
  _Haoyan Xu, Zhengtao Yao, Ziyi Wang, Zhan Cheng, Xiyang Hu, Mengyuan Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in graphs is critical for ensuring model robustness in open-world and safety-sensitive applications. Existing approaches to graph OOD detection typically involve training an in-distribution (ID) classifier using only ID data, followed by the application of post-hoc OOD scoring techniques. Although OOD exposure - introducing auxiliary OOD samples during training - has proven to be an effective strategy for enhancing detection performance, current methods in the graph domain generally assume access to a set of real OOD nodes. This assumption, however, is often impractical due to the difficulty and cost of acquiring representative OOD samples. In this paper, we introduce GOE-LLM, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for OOD exposure in graph OOD detection without requiring real OOD nodes. GOE-LLM introduces two pipelines: (1) identifying pseudo-OOD nodes from the initially unlabeled graph using zero-shot LLM annotations, and (2) generating semantically informative synthetic OOD nodes via LLM-prompted text generation. These pseudo-OOD nodes are then used to regularize the training of the ID classifier for improved OOD awareness. We evaluate our approach across multiple benchmark datasets, showing that GOE-LLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph OOD detection methods that do not use OOD exposure and achieves comparable performance to those relying on real OOD data.

- **[GLIP-OOD: Zero-Shot Graph OOD Detection with Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21186)**  `arXiv:2504.21186`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of machine learning systems, particularly in dynamic and open-world environments. In the vision and text domains, zero-shot OOD detection - which requires no training on in-distribution (ID) data - has made significant progress through the use of large-scale pretrained models such as vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs). However, zero-shot OOD detection in graph-structured data remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the challenges posed by complex relational structures and the absence of powerful, large-scale pretrained models for graphs. In this work, we take the first step toward enabling zero-shot graph OOD detection by leveraging a graph foundation model (GFM). We show that, when provided only with class label names, the GFM can perform OOD detection without any node-level supervision - outperforming existing supervised methods across multiple datasets. To address the more practical setting where OOD label names are unavailable, we introduce GLIP-OOD, a novel framework that employs LLMs to generate semantically informative pseudo-OOD labels from unlabeled data. These labels enable the GFM to capture nuanced semantic boundaries between ID and OOD classes and perform fine-grained OOD detection - without requiring any labeled nodes. Our approach is the first to enable node-level graph OOD detection in a fully zero-shot setting, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark text-attributed graph datasets.

  Sensor degradation poses a significant challenge in autonomous driving. During heavy rainfall, the interference from raindrops can adversely affect the quality of LiDAR point clouds, resulting in, for instance, inaccurate point measurements. This, in turn, can potentially lead to safety concerns if autonomous driving systems are not weather-aware, i.e., if they are unable to discern such changes. In this study, we release a new, large-scale, multi-modal emulated rain dataset, REHEARSE-3D, to promote research advancements in 3D point cloud de-raining. Distinct from the most relevant competitors, our dataset is unique in several respects. First, it is the largest point-wise annotated dataset, and second, it is the only one with high-resolution LiDAR data (LiDAR-256) enriched with 4D Radar point clouds logged in both daytime and nighttime conditions in a controlled weather environment. Furthermore, REHEARSE-3D involves rain-characteristic information, which is of significant value not only for sensor noise modeling but also for analyzing the impact of weather at a point level. Leveraging REHEARSE-3D, we benchmark raindrop detection and removal in fused LiDAR and 4D Radar point clouds. Our comprehensive study further evaluates the performance of various statistical and deep-learning models. Upon publication, the dataset and benchmark models will be made publicly available at:this https URL.

- **[CMD: Constraining Multimodal Distribution for Domain Adaptation in Stereo Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21302)**  `arXiv:2504.21302`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Zhelun Shen, Zhuo Li, Chenming Wu, Zhibo Rao, Lina Liu, Yuchao Dai, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, learning-based stereo matching methods have achieved great improvement in public benchmarks, where soft argmin and smooth L1 loss play a core contribution to their success. However, in unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios, we observe that these two operations often yield multimodal disparity probability distributions in target domains, resulting in degraded generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Constrain Multi-modal Distribution (CMD), to address this issue. Specifically, we introduce \textit{uncertainty-regularized minimization} and \textit{anisotropic soft argmin} to encourage the network to produce predominantly unimodal disparity distributions in the target domain, thereby improving prediction accuracy. Experimentally, we apply the proposed method to multiple representative stereo-matching networks and conduct domain adaptation from synthetic data to unlabeled real-world scenes. Results consistently demonstrate improved generalization in both top-performing and domain-adaptable stereo-matching models. The code for CMD will be available at: \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

- **[Visual Adaptive Prompting for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20292)**  `arXiv:2502.20292`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Kyle Stein, Arash Mahyari, Guillermo Francia, Eman El-Sheikh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in learning joint representations of visual and textual data, making them powerful tools for tasks such as Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL). CZSL requires models to generalize to novel combinations of visual primitives-such as attributes and objects-that were not explicitly encountered during training. Recent works in prompting for CZSL have focused on modifying inputs for the text encoder, often using static prompts that do not change across varying visual contexts. However, these approaches struggle to fully capture varying visual contexts, as they focus on text adaptation rather than leveraging visual features for compositional reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual Adaptive Prompting System (VAPS) that leverages a learnable visual prompt repository and similarity-based retrieval mechanism within the framework of VLMs to bridge the gap between semantic and visual features. Our method introduces a dynamic visual prompt repository mechanism that selects the most relevant attribute and object prompts based on the visual features of the image. Our proposed system includes a visual prompt adapter that encourages the model to learn a more generalizable embedding space. Experiments on three CZSL benchmarks, across both closed and open-world scenarios, demonstrate state-of-the-art results.

- **[Semantic Positive Pairs for Enhancing Visual Representation Learning of Instance Discrimination Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16122)**  `arXiv:2306.16122`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Mohammad Alkhalefi, Georgios Leontidis, Mingjun Zhong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-supervised learning algorithms (SSL) based on instance discrimination have shown promising results, performing competitively or even outperforming supervised learning counterparts in some downstream tasks. Such approaches employ data augmentation to create two views of the same instance (i.e., positive pairs) and encourage the model to learn good representations by attracting these views closer in the embedding space without collapsing to the trivial solution. However, data augmentation is limited in representing positive pairs, and the repulsion process between the instances during contrastive learning may discard important features for instances that have similar categories. To address this issue, we propose an approach to identify those images with similar semantic content and treat them as positive instances, thereby reducing the chance of discarding important features during representation learning and increasing the richness of the latent representation. Our approach is generic and could work with any self-supervised instance discrimination frameworks such as MoCo and SimSiam. To evaluate our method, we run experiments on three benchmark datasets: ImageNet, STL-10 and CIFAR-10 with different instance discrimination SSL approaches. The experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all three datasets; for instance, we improve upon the vanilla MoCo-v2 by 4.1% on ImageNet under a linear evaluation protocol over 800 epochs. We also report results on semi-supervised learning, transfer learning on downstream tasks, and object detection.

- **[All Languages Matter: Evaluating LMMs on Culturally Diverse 100 Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16508)**  `arXiv:2411.16508`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`  
  _Ashmal Vayani, Dinura Dissanayake, Hasindri Watawana, Noor Ahsan, Nevasini Sasikumar, Omkar Thawakar, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) generally focus on only a few regions and languages. As LMMs continue to improve, it is increasingly important to ensure they understand cultural contexts, respect local sensitivities, and support low-resource languages, all while effectively integrating corresponding visual cues. In pursuit of culturally diverse global multimodal models, our proposed All Languages Matter Benchmark (ALM-bench) represents the largest and most comprehensive effort to date for evaluating LMMs across 100 languages. ALM-bench challenges existing models by testing their ability to understand and reason about culturally diverse images paired with text in various languages, including many low-resource languages traditionally underrepresented in LMM research. The benchmark offers a robust and nuanced evaluation framework featuring various question formats, including true/false, multiple choice, and open-ended questions, which are further divided into short and long-answer categories. ALM-bench design ensures a comprehensive assessment of a model's ability to handle varied levels of difficulty in visual and linguistic reasoning. To capture the rich tapestry of global cultures, ALM-bench carefully curates content from 13 distinct cultural aspects, ranging from traditions and rituals to famous personalities and celebrations. Through this, ALM-bench not only provides a rigorous testing ground for state-of-the-art open and closed-source LMMs but also highlights the importance of cultural and linguistic inclusivity, encouraging the development of models that can serve diverse global populations effectively. Our benchmark is publicly available.

- **[HOT3D: Hand and Object Tracking in 3D from Egocentric Multi-View Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19167)**  `arXiv:2411.19167`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.RO`  
  _Prithviraj Banerjee, Sindi Shkodrani, Pierre Moulon, Shreyas Hampali, Shangchen Han, Fan Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce HOT3D, a publicly available dataset for egocentric hand and object tracking in 3D. The dataset offers over 833 minutes (3.7M+ images) of recordings that feature 19 subjects interacting with 33 diverse rigid objects. In addition to simple pick-up, observe, and put-down actions, the subjects perform actions typical for a kitchen, office, and living room environment. The recordings include multiple synchronized data streams containing egocentric multi-view RGB/monochrome images, eye gaze signal, scene point clouds, and 3D poses of cameras, hands, and objects. The dataset is recorded with two headsets from Meta: Project Aria, which is a research prototype of AI glasses, and Quest 3, a virtual-reality headset that has shipped millions of units. Ground-truth poses were obtained by a motion-capture system using small optical markers attached to hands and objects. Hand annotations are provided in the UmeTrack and MANO formats, and objects are represented by 3D meshes with PBR materials obtained by an in-house scanner. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-view egocentric data for three popular tasks: 3D hand tracking, model-based 6DoF object pose estimation, and 3D lifting of unknown in-hand objects. The evaluated multi-view methods, whose benchmarking is uniquely enabled by HOT3D, significantly outperform their single-view counterparts.

- **[Black-Box Visual Prompt Engineering for Mitigating Object Hallucination in Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21559)**  `arXiv:2504.21559`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Sangmin Woo, Kang Zhou, Yun Zhou, Shuai Wang, Sheng Guan, Haibo Ding, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, which undermines their reliability. Surprisingly, we find that simple object-based visual prompting -- overlaying visual cues (e.g., bounding box, circle) on images -- can significantly mitigate such hallucination; however, different visual prompts (VPs) vary in effectiveness. To address this, we propose Black-Box Visual Prompt Engineering (BBVPE), a framework to identify optimal VPs that enhance LVLM responses without needing access to model internals. Our approach employs a pool of candidate VPs and trains a router model to dynamically select the most effective VP for a given input image. This black-box approach is model-agnostic, making it applicable to both open-source and proprietary LVLMs. Evaluations on benchmarks such as POPE and CHAIR demonstrate that BBVPE effectively reduces object hallucination.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid development of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), an increasing number of benchmarks have been established to evaluate the video understanding capabilities of these models. However, these benchmarks focus on \textbf{standalone} videos and mainly assess ``visual elements'' like human actions and object states. In reality, contemporary videos often encompass complex and continuous narratives, typically presented as a \textbf{series}. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{SeriesBench}, a benchmark consisting of 105 carefully curated narrative-driven series, covering 28 specialized tasks that require deep narrative understanding. Specifically, we first select a diverse set of drama series spanning various genres. Then, we introduce a novel long-span narrative annotation method, combined with a full-information transformation approach to convert manual annotations into diverse task formats. To further enhance model capacity for detailed analysis of plot structures and character relationships within series, we propose a novel narrative reasoning framework, \textbf{PC-DCoT}. Extensive results on \textbf{SeriesBench} indicate that existing MLLMs still face significant challenges in understanding narrative-driven series, while \textbf{PC-DCoT} enables these MLLMs to achieve performance improvements. Overall, our \textbf{SeriesBench} and \textbf{PC-DCoT} highlight the critical necessity of advancing model capabilities to understand narrative-driven series, guiding the future development of MLLMs. SeriesBench is publicly available atthis https URL.

  _Eunsoo Im, Changhyun Jee, Jung Kwon Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emerging trend in computer vision emphasizes developing universal models capable of simultaneously addressing multiple diverse tasks. Such universality typically requires joint training across multi-domain datasets to ensure effective generalization. However, monocular 3D object detection presents unique challenges in multi-domain training due to the scarcity of datasets annotated with accurate 3D ground-truth labels, especially beyond typical road-based autonomous driving contexts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel weakly supervised framework leveraging pseudo-labels. Current pretrained models often struggle to accurately detect pedestrians in non-road environments due to inherent dataset biases. Unlike generalized image-based 2D object detection models, achieving similar generalization in monocular 3D detection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose GATE3D, a novel framework designed specifically for generalized monocular 3D object detection via weak supervision. GATE3D effectively bridges domain gaps by employing consistency losses between 2D and 3D predictions. Remarkably, our model achieves competitive performance on the KITTI benchmark as well as on an indoor-office dataset collected by us to evaluate the generalization capabilities of our framework. Our results demonstrate that GATE3D significantly accelerates learning from limited annotated data through effective pre-training strategies, highlighting substantial potential for broader impacts in robotics, augmented reality, and virtual reality applications.

  _Xingxi Yin, Zhi Li, Jingfeng Zhang, Chenglin Li, Yin Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, with their impressive generative capabilities, have been adopted for image editing tasks, demonstrating remarkable efficacy. However, due to attention leakage and collision between the cross-attention map of the object and the new color attribute from the text prompt, text-guided image editing methods may fail to change the color of an object, resulting in a misalignment between the resulting image and the text prompt. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the process of text-guided image synthesizing and what semantic information different cross-attention blocks have learned. We observe that the visual representation of an object is determined in the up-block of the diffusion model in the early stage of the denoising process, and color adjustment can be achieved through value matrices alignment in the cross-attention layer. Based on our findings, we propose a straightforward, yet stable, and effective image-guided method to modify the color of an object without requiring any additional fine-tuning or training. Lastly, we present a benchmark dataset called COLORBENCH, the first benchmark to evaluate the performance of color change methods. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in object-level color editing and surpass the performance of popular text-guided image editing approaches in both synthesized and real images.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  World models have attracted increasing attention in autonomous driving for their ability to forecast potential future scenarios. In this paper, we propose BEVWorld, a novel framework that transforms multimodal sensor inputs into a unified and compact Bird's Eye View (BEV) latent space for holistic environment modeling. The proposed world model consists of two main components: a multi-modal tokenizer and a latent BEV sequence diffusion model. The multi-modal tokenizer first encodes heterogeneous sensory data, and its decoder reconstructs the latent BEV tokens into LiDAR and surround-view image observations via ray-casting rendering in a self-supervised manner. This enables joint modeling and bidirectional encoding-decoding of panoramic imagery and point cloud data within a shared spatial representation. On top of this, the latent BEV sequence diffusion model performs temporally consistent forecasting of future scenes, conditioned on high-level action tokens, enabling scene-level reasoning over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BEVWorld on autonomous driving benchmarks, showcasing its capability in realistic future scene generation and its benefits for downstream tasks such as perception and motion prediction.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at simple vision-language tasks but struggle when faced with complex tasks that require multiple capabilities, such as simultaneously recognizing objects, counting them, and understanding their spatial relationships. This might be partially the result of the fact that Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT), a critical training step for MLLMs, has traditionally focused on scaling data volume, but not the compositional complexity of training examples. We propose COMPACT (COMPositional Atomic-to-complex visual Capability Tuning), which generates a training dataset explicitly controlling for the compositional complexity of the training examples. The data from COMPACT allows MLLMs to train on combinations of atomic capabilities to learn complex capabilities more efficiently. Across all benchmarks, COMPACT achieves comparable performance to the LLaVA-665k VIT while using less than 10% of its data budget, and even outperforms it on several, especially those involving complex multi-capability tasks. For example, COMPACT achieves substantial 83.3% improvement on MMStar and 94.0% improvement on MM-Vet compared to the full-scale VIT on particularly complex questions that require four or more atomic capabilities. COMPACT offers a scalable, data-efficient, visual compositional tuning recipe to improve on complex visual-language tasks.

  Generative models enhance neuroimaging through data augmentation, quality improvement, and rare condition studies. Despite advances in realistic synthetic MRIs, evaluations focus on texture and perception, lacking sensitivity to crucial anatomical fidelity. This study proposes a new metric, called WASABI (Wasserstein-Based Anatomical Brain Index), to assess the anatomical realism of synthetic brain MRIs. WASABI leverages \textit{SynthSeg}, a deep learning-based brain parcellation tool, to derive volumetric measures of brain regions in each MRI and uses the multivariate Wasserstein distance to compare distributions between real and synthetic anatomies. Based on controlled experiments on two real datasets and synthetic MRIs from five generative models, WASABI demonstrates higher sensitivity in quantifying anatomical discrepancies compared to traditional image-level metrics, even when synthetic images achieve near-perfect visual quality. Our findings advocate for shifting the evaluation paradigm beyond visual inspection and conventional metrics, emphasizing anatomical fidelity as a crucial benchmark for clinically meaningful brain MRI synthesis.

  Visual text is a crucial component in both document and scene images, conveying rich semantic information and attracting significant attention in the computer vision community. Beyond traditional tasks such as text detection and recognition, visual text processing has witnessed rapid advancements driven by the emergence of foundation models, including text image reconstruction and text image manipulation. Despite significant progress, challenges remain due to the unique properties that differentiate text from general objects. Effectively capturing and leveraging these distinct textual characteristics is essential for developing robust visual text processing models. In this survey, we present a comprehensive, multi-perspective analysis of recent advancements in visual text processing, focusing on two key questions: (1) What textual features are most suitable for different visual text processing tasks? (2) How can these distinctive text features be effectively incorporated into processing frameworks? Furthermore, we introduce VTPBench, a new benchmark that encompasses a broad range of visual text processing datasets. Leveraging the advanced visual quality assessment capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we propose VTPScore, a novel evaluation metric designed to ensure fair and reliable evaluation. Our empirical study with more than 20 specific models reveals substantial room for improvement in the current techniques. Our aim is to establish this work as a fundamental resource that fosters future exploration and innovation in the dynamic field of visual text processing.

  Multimodal agents, which integrate a controller (e.g., a large language model) with external tools, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tackling complex tasks. However, existing agents need to collect a large number of expert data for fine-tuning to adapt to new environments. In this paper, we propose an online self-exploration method for multimodal agents, namely SPORT, via step-wise preference optimization to refine the trajectories of agents, which automatically generates tasks and learns from solving the generated tasks, without any expert annotation. SPORT operates through four iterative components: task synthesis, step sampling, step verification, and preference tuning. First, we synthesize multi-modal tasks using language models. Then, we introduce a novel search scheme, where step sampling and step verification are executed alternately to solve each generated task. We employ a verifier to provide AI feedback to construct step-wise preference data. The data is subsequently used to update the controller's policy through preference tuning, producing a SPORT Agent. By interacting with real environments, the SPORT Agent evolves into a more refined and capable system. Evaluation in the GTA and GAIA benchmarks show that the SPORT Agent achieves 6.41\% and 3.64\% improvements, underscoring the generalization and effectiveness introduced by our method.

  We present SAM4EM, a novel approach for 3D segmentation of complex neural structures in electron microscopy (EM) data by leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) alongside advanced fine-tuning strategies. Our contributions include the development of a prompt-free adapter for SAM using two stage mask decoding to automatically generate prompt embeddings, a dual-stage fine-tuning method based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for enhancing segmentation with limited annotated data, and a 3D memory attention mechanism to ensure segmentation consistency across 3D stacks. We further release a unique benchmark dataset for the segmentation of astrocytic processes and synapses. We evaluated our method on challenging neuroscience segmentation benchmarks, specifically targeting mitochondria, glia, and synapses, with significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including recent SAM-based adapters developed for the medical domain and other vision transformer-based approaches. Experimental results indicate that our approach outperforms existing solutions in the segmentation of complex processes like glia and post-synaptic densities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose a method for video face reenactment that integrates a 3D face parametric model into a latent diffusion framework, aiming to improve shape consistency and motion control in existing video-based face generation approaches. Our approach employs the FLAME (Faces Learned with an Articulated Model and Expressions) model as the 3D face parametric representation, providing a unified framework for modeling face expressions and head pose. This enables precise extraction of detailed face geometry and motion features from driving videos. Specifically, we enhance the latent diffusion model with rich 3D expression and detailed pose information by incorporating depth maps, normal maps, and rendering maps derived from FLAME sequences. A multi-layer face movements fusion module with integrated self-attention mechanisms is used to combine identity and motion latent features within the spatial domain. By utilizing the 3D face parametric model as motion guidance, our method enables parametric alignment of face identity between the reference image and the motion captured from the driving video. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method excels at generating high-quality face animations with precise expression and head pose variation modeling. In addition, it demonstrates strong generalization performance on out-of-domain images. Code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to segment objects of novel classes in new domains, which is often challenging due to the diverse characteristics of target domains and the limited availability of support data. Most CD-FSS methods redesign and retrain in-domain FSS models using various domain-generalization techniques, which are effective but costly to train. To address these issues, we propose adapting informative model structures of the well-trained FSS model for target domains by learning domain characteristics from few-shot labeled support samples during inference, thereby eliminating the need for retraining. Specifically, we first adaptively identify domain-specific model structures by measuring parameter importance using a novel structure Fisher score in a data-dependent manner. Then, we progressively train the selected informative model structures with hierarchically constructed training samples, progressing from fewer to more support shots. The resulting Informative Structure Adaptation (ISA) method effectively addresses domain shifts and equips existing well-trained in-domain FSS models with flexible adaptation capabilities for new domains, eliminating the need to redesign or retrain CD-FSS models on base data. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating superior performance across multiple CD-FSS benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video question answering benefits from the rich information available in videos, enabling a wide range of applications. However, the large volume of tokens generated from longer videos presents significant challenges to memory efficiency and model performance. To alleviate this issue, existing works propose to compress video inputs, but usually overlooking the varying importance of static and dynamic information across different queries, leading to inefficient token usage within limited budgets. To tackle this, we propose a novel token selection strategy, EXPLORE-THEN-SELECT, that adaptively adjust static and dynamic information needed based on question requirements. Our framework first explores different token allocations between static frames, which preserve spatial details, and dynamic frames, which capture temporal changes. Next, it employs a query-aware attention-based metric to select the optimal token combination without model updates. Our proposed framework is plug-and-play that can be seamlessly integrated within diverse video-language models. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves significant performance improvements (up to 5.8%) among various video question answering benchmarks.

  Automatic font generation (AFG) is the process of creating a new font using only a few examples of the style images. Generating fonts for complex languages like Korean and Chinese, particularly in handwritten styles, presents significant challenges. Traditional AFGs, like Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), are usually unstable during training and often face mode collapse problems. They also struggle to capture fine details within font images. To address these problems, we present a diffusion-based AFG method which generates high-quality, diverse Korean font images using only a single reference image, focusing on handwritten and printed styles. Our approach refines noisy images incrementally, ensuring stable training and visually appealing results. A key innovation is our text encoder, which processes phonetic representations to generate accurate and contextually correct characters, even for unseen characters. We used a pre-trained style encoder from DG FONT to effectively and accurately encode the style images. To further enhance the generation quality, we used perceptual loss that guides the model to focus on the global style of generated images. Experimental results on over 2000 Korean characters demonstrate that our model consistently generates accurate and detailed font images and outperforms benchmark methods, making it a reliable tool for generating authentic Korean fonts across different styles.

  Facial expression recognition (FER) is a key research area in computer vision and human-computer interaction. Despite recent advances in deep learning, challenges persist, especially in generalizing to new scenarios. In fact, zero-shot FER significantly reduces the performance of state-of-the-art FER models. To address this problem, the community has recently started to explore the integration of knowledge from Large Language Models for visual tasks. In this work, we evaluate a broad collection of locally executed Visual Language Models (VLMs), avoiding the lack of task-specific knowledge by adopting a Visual Question Answering strategy. We compare the proposed pipeline with state-of-the-art FER models, both integrating and excluding VLMs, evaluating well-known FER benchmarks: AffectNet, FERPlus, and RAF-DB. The results show excellent performance for some VLMs in zero-shot FER scenarios, indicating the need for further exploration to improve FER generalization.

  The rapid development of text-to-image (T2I) generation approaches has attracted extensive interest in evaluating the quality of generated images, leading to the development of various quality assessment methods for general-purpose T2I outputs. However, existing image quality assessment (IQA) methods are limited to providing global quality scores, failing to deliver fine-grained perceptual evaluations for structurally complex subjects like humans, which is a critical challenge considering the frequent anatomical and textural distortions in AI-generated human images (AGHIs). To address this gap, we introduce AGHI-QA, the first large-scale benchmark specifically designed for quality assessment of AGHIs. The dataset comprises 4,000 images generated from 400 carefully crafted text prompts using 10 state of-the-art T2I models. We conduct a systematic subjective study to collect multidimensional annotations, including perceptual quality scores, text-image correspondence scores, visible and distorted body part labels. Based on AGHI-QA, we evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of current T2I methods in generating human images from multiple dimensions. Furthermore, we propose AGHI-Assessor, a novel quality metric that integrates the large multimodal model (LMM) with domain-specific human features for precise quality prediction and identification of visible and distorted body parts in AGHIs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AGHI-Assessor showcases state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing IQA methods in multidimensional quality assessment and surpassing leading LMMs in detecting structural distortions in AGHIs.

  In action recognition tasks, feature diversity is essential for enhancing model generalization and performance. Existing methods typically promote feature diversity by expanding the training data in the sample space, which often leads to inefficiencies and semantic inconsistencies. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel Coarse-fine text co-guidance Diffusion model (CoCoDiff). CoCoDiff generates diverse yet semantically consistent features in the latent space by leveraging diffusion and multi-granularity textual guidance. Specifically, our approach feeds spatio-temporal features extracted from skeleton sequences into a latent diffusion model to generate diverse action representations. Meanwhile, we introduce a coarse-fine text co-guided strategy that leverages textual information from large language models (LLMs) to ensure semantic consistency between the generated features and the original inputs. It is noted that CoCoDiff operates as a plug-and-play auxiliary module during training, incurring no additional inference cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoCoDiff achieves SOTA performance on skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120 and Kinetics-Skeleton.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image inpainting is a fundamental research area between image editing and image generation. Recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have explored novel attention mechanisms, lightweight architectures, and context-aware modeling, demonstrating impressive performance. However, they often struggle with complex structure (e.g., texture, shape, spatial relations) and semantics (e.g., color consistency, object restoration, and logical correctness), leading to artifacts and inappropriate generation. To address this challenge, we design a simple yet effective inpainting paradigm called latent categories guidance, and further propose a diffusion-based model named PixelHacker. Specifically, we first construct a large dataset containing 14 million image-mask pairs by annotating foreground and background (potential 116 and 21 categories, respectively). Then, we encode potential foreground and background representations separately through two fixed-size embeddings, and intermittently inject these features into the denoising process via linear attention. Finally, by pre-training on our dataset and fine-tuning on open-source benchmarks, we obtain PixelHacker. Extensive experiments show that PixelHacker comprehensively outperforms the SOTA on a wide range of datasets (Places2, CelebA-HQ, and FFHQ) and exhibits remarkable consistency in both structure and semantics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Class-agnostic counting (CAC) aims to estimate the number of objects in images without being restricted to predefined categories. However, while current exemplar-based CAC methods offer flexibility at inference time, they still rely heavily on labeled data for training, which limits scalability and generalization to many downstream use cases. In this paper, we introduce CountingDINO, the first training-free exemplar-based CAC framework that exploits a fully unsupervised feature extractor. Specifically, our approach employs self-supervised vision-only backbones to extract object-aware features, and it eliminates the need for annotated data throughout the entire proposed pipeline. At inference time, we extract latent object prototypes via ROI-Align from DINO features and use them as convolutional kernels to generate similarity maps. These are then transformed into density maps through a simple yet effective normalization scheme. We evaluate our approach on the FSC-147 benchmark, where we consistently outperform a baseline based on an SOTA unsupervised object detector under the same label- and training-free setting. Additionally, we achieve competitive results -- and in some cases surpass -- training-free methods that rely on supervised backbones, non-training-free unsupervised methods, as well as several fully supervised SOTA approaches. This demonstrates that label- and training-free CAC can be both scalable and effective. Code:this https URL.

  With the rapid development of 3D reconstruction technology, research in 4D reconstruction is also advancing, existing 4D reconstruction methods can generate high-quality 4D scenes. However, due to the challenges in acquiring multi-view video data, the current 4D reconstruction benchmarks mainly display actions performed in place, such as dancing, within limited scenarios. In practical scenarios, many scenes involve wide-range spatial movements, highlighting the limitations of existing 4D reconstruction datasets. Additionally, existing 4D reconstruction methods rely on deformation fields to estimate the dynamics of 3D objects, but deformation fields struggle with wide-range spatial movements, which limits the ability to achieve high-quality 4D scene reconstruction with wide-range spatial movements. In this paper, we focus on 4D scene reconstruction with significant object spatial movements and propose a novel 4D reconstruction benchmark, WideRange4D. This benchmark includes rich 4D scene data with large spatial variations, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of the generation capabilities of 4D generation methods. Furthermore, we introduce a new 4D reconstruction method, Progress4D, which generates stable and high-quality 4D results across various complex 4D scene reconstruction tasks. We conduct both quantitative and qualitative comparison experiments on WideRange4D, showing that our Progress4D outperforms existing state-of-the-art 4D reconstruction methods. Project:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pseudo-label learning methods have been widely applied in weakly-supervised temporal action localization. Existing works directly utilize weakly-supervised base model to generate instance-level pseudo-labels for training the fully-supervised detection head. We argue that the noise in pseudo-labels would interfere with the learning of fully-supervised detection head, leading to significant performance leakage. Issues with noisy labels include:(1) inaccurate boundary localization; (2) undetected short action clips; (3) multiple adjacent segments incorrectly detected as one segment. To target these issues, we introduce a two-stage noisy label learning strategy to harness every potential useful signal in noisy labels. First, we propose a frame-level pseudo-label generation model with a context-aware denoising algorithm to refine the boundaries. Second, we introduce an online-revised teacher-student framework with a missing instance compensation module and an ambiguous instance correction module to solve the short-action-missing and many-to-one problems. Besides, we apply a high-quality pseudo-label mining loss in our online-revised teacher-student framework to add different weights to the noisy labels to train more effectively. Our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method in detection accuracy and inference speed greatly upon the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.2 benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual odometry (VO) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, robotic navigation, and other related tasks by estimating the position and orientation of a camera based on visual input. Significant progress has been made in data-driven VO methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques to extract image features and estimate camera poses. However, these methods often struggle in low-light conditions because of the reduced visibility of features and the increased difficulty of matching keypoints. To address this limitation, we introduce BrightVO, a novel VO model based on Transformer architecture, which not only performs front-end visual feature extraction, but also incorporates a multi-modality refinement module in the back-end that integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Using pose graph optimization, this module iteratively refines pose estimates to reduce errors and improve both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we create a synthetic low-light dataset, KiC4R, which includes a variety of lighting conditions to facilitate the training and evaluation of VO frameworks in challenging environments. Experimental results demonstrate that BrightVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the KiC4R dataset and the KITTI benchmarks. Specifically, it provides an average improvement of 20% in pose estimation accuracy in normal outdoor environments and 259% in low-light conditions, outperforming existing methods.

  Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for extracting representations from Earth observation data, but their evaluation remains inconsistent and narrow. Existing works often evaluate on suboptimal downstream datasets and tasks, that are often too easy or too narrow, limiting the usefulness of the evaluations to assess the real-world applicability of GFMs. Additionally, there is a distinct lack of diversity in current evaluation protocols, which fail to account for the multiplicity of image resolutions, sensor types, and temporalities, which further complicates the assessment of GFM performance. In particular, most existing benchmarks are geographically biased towards North America and Europe, questioning the global applicability of GFMs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PANGAEA, a standardized evaluation protocol that covers a diverse set of datasets, tasks, resolutions, sensor modalities, and temporalities. It establishes a robust and widely applicable benchmark for GFMs. We evaluate the most popular GFMs openly available on this benchmark and analyze their performance across several domains. In particular, we compare these models to supervised baselines (e.g. UNet and vanilla ViT), and assess their effectiveness when faced with limited labeled data. Our findings highlight the limitations of GFMs, under different scenarios, showing that they do not consistently outperform supervised models. PANGAEA is designed to be highly extensible, allowing for the seamless inclusion of new datasets, models, and tasks in future research. By releasing the evaluation code and benchmark, we aim to enable other researchers to replicate our experiments and build upon our work, fostering a more principled evaluation protocol for large pre-trained geospatial models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pathology and anatomy are two essential groups of semantics in medical data. Pathology describes what the diseases are, while anatomy explains where the diseases occur. They describe diseases from different perspectives, providing complementary insights into diseases. Thus, properly understanding these semantics and their relationships can enhance medical vision-language models (VLMs). However, pathology and anatomy semantics are usually entangled in medical data, hindering VLMs from explicitly modeling these semantics and their relationships. To address this challenge, we propose MeDSLIP, a novel Medical Dual-Stream Language-Image Pre-training pipeline, to disentangle pathology and anatomy semantics and model the relationships between them. We introduce a dual-stream mechanism in MeDSLIP to explicitly disentangle medical semantics into pathology-relevant and anatomy-relevant streams and align visual and textual information within each stream. Furthermore, we propose an interaction modeling module with prototypical contrastive learning loss and intra-image contrastive learning loss to regularize the relationships between pathology and anatomy semantics. We apply MeDSLIP to chest X-ray analysis and conduct comprehensive evaluations with four benchmark datasets: NIH CXR14, RSNA Pneumonia, SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax, and COVIDx CXR-4. The results demonstrate MeDSLIP's superior generalizability and transferability across different scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current prevailing Video Object Segmentation methods follow the pipeline of extraction-then-matching, which first extracts features on current and reference frames independently, and then performs dense matching between them. This decoupled pipeline limits information propagation between frames to high-level features, hindering fine-grained details for matching. Furthermore, the pixel-wise matching lacks holistic target understanding, making it prone to disturbance by similar distractors. To address these issues, we propose a unified VOS framework, coined as JointFormer, for jointly modeling feature extraction, correspondence matching, and a compressed memory. The core Joint Modeling Block leverages attention to simultaneously extract and propagate the target information from the reference frame to the current frame and a compressed memory token. This joint scheme enables extensive multi-layer propagation beyond high-level feature space and facilitates robust instance-distinctive feature learning. To incorporate the long-term and holistic target information, we introduce a compressed memory token with a customized online updating mechanism, which aggregates target features and facilitates temporal information propagation in a frame-wise manner, enhancing global modeling consistency. Our JointFormer achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the DAVIS 2017 val/test-dev (89.7\% and 87.6\%) benchmarks and the YouTube-VOS 2018/2019 val (87.0\% and 87.0\%) benchmarks, outperforming the existing works. To demonstrate the generalizability of our model, it is further evaluated on four new benchmarks with various difficulties, including MOSE for complex scenes, VISOR for egocentric videos, VOST for complex transformations, and LVOS for long-term videos.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often require extensive fine-tuning and large datasets for specialized domains like law. General-purpose pre-training may not capture legal nuances, and acquiring sufficient legal data is challenging. We introduce SynLexLM, a novel approach to efficiently pre-train a legal LLM. Our method employs curriculum learning, progressing from simple to complex legal texts and queries, combined with synthetic data augmentation using models like Gemini Pro to address data scarcity. We aim to achieve improved performance on legal benchmarks (BigLaw-Bench, EUR-Lex-Sum) compared to traditional models and fine-tuned versions. Preliminary work involves generating synthetic QA pairs reflecting legal reasoning. This work aims to enhance legal document analysis and research tools, potentially democratizing access to advanced legal AI.

  Hallucinations are a persistent problem with Large Language Models (LLMs). As these models become increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare and finance, the need for effective hallucination detection is crucial. To this end, we propose a versatile framework for zero-resource hallucination detection that practitioners can apply to real-world use cases. To achieve this, we adapt a variety of existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques, including black-box UQ, white-box UQ, and LLM-as-a-Judge, transforming them as necessary into standardized response-level confidence scores ranging from 0 to 1. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a tunable ensemble approach that incorporates any combination of the individual confidence scores. This approach enables practitioners to optimize the ensemble for a specific use case for improved performance. To streamline implementation, the full suite of scorers is offered in this paper's companion Python toolkit, UQLM. To evaluate the performance of the various scorers, we conduct an extensive set of experiments using several LLM question-answering benchmarks. We find that our tunable ensemble typically surpasses its individual components and outperforms existing hallucination detection methods. Our results demonstrate the benefits of customized hallucination detection strategies for improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs.

  We introduce DeepSeek-Prover-V2, an open-source large language model designed for formal theorem proving in Lean 4, with initialization data collected through a recursive theorem proving pipeline powered by DeepSeek-V3. The cold-start training procedure begins by prompting DeepSeek-V3 to decompose complex problems into a series of subgoals. The proofs of resolved subgoals are synthesized into a chain-of-thought process, combined with DeepSeek-V3's step-by-step reasoning, to create an initial cold start for reinforcement learning. This process enables us to integrate both informal and formal mathematical reasoning into a unified model. The resulting model, DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B, achieves state-of-the-art performance in neural theorem proving, reaching 88.9% pass ratio on the MiniF2F-test and solving 49 out of 658 problems from PutnamBench. In addition to standard benchmarks, we introduce ProverBench, a collection of 325 formalized problems, to enrich our evaluation, including 15 selected problems from the recent AIME competitions (years 24-25). Further evaluation on these 15 AIME problems shows that the model successfully solves 6 of them. In comparison, DeepSeek-V3 solves 8 of these problems using majority voting, highlighting that the gap between formal and informal mathematical reasoning in large language models is substantially narrowing.

  Arabic text diacritization remains a persistent challenge in natural language processing due to the language's morphological richness. In this paper, we introduce Sadeed, a novel approach based on a fine-tuned decoder-only language model adapted from Kuwain 1.5B Hennara et al. [2025], a compact model originally trained on diverse Arabic corpora. Sadeed is fine-tuned on carefully curated, high-quality diacritized datasets, constructed through a rigorous data-cleaning and normalization pipeline. Despite utilizing modest computational resources, Sadeed achieves competitive results compared to proprietary large language models and outperforms traditional models trained on similar domains. Additionally, we highlight key limitations in current benchmarking practices for Arabic diacritization. To address these issues, we introduce SadeedDiac-25, a new benchmark designed to enable fairer and more comprehensive evaluation across diverse text genres and complexity levels. Together, Sadeed and SadeedDiac-25 provide a robust foundation for advancing Arabic NLP applications, including machine translation, text-to-speech, and language learning tools.

  Speech Event Extraction (SpeechEE) is a challenging task that lies at the intersection of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), requiring the identification of structured event information from spoken language. In this work, we present a modular, pipeline-based SpeechEE framework that integrates high-performance ASR with semantic search-enhanced prompting of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our system first classifies speech segments likely to contain events using a hybrid filtering mechanism including rule-based, BERT-based, and LLM-based models. It then employs few-shot LLM prompting, dynamically enriched via semantic similarity retrieval, to identify event triggers and extract corresponding arguments. We evaluate the pipeline using multiple LLMs (Llama3-8B, GPT-4o-mini, and o1-mini) highlighting significant performance gains with o1-mini, which achieves 63.3% F1 on trigger classification and 27.8% F1 on argument classification, outperforming prior benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that pipeline approaches, when empowered by retrieval-augmented LLMs, can rival or exceed end-to-end systems while maintaining interpretability and modularity. This work provides practical insights into LLM-driven event extraction and opens pathways for future hybrid models combining textual and acoustic features.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the recent advances in Large Language Models, benchmarks for evaluating legal writing remain scarce due to the inherent complexity of assessing open-ended responses in this domain. One of the key challenges in evaluating language models on domain-specific tasks is finding test datasets that are public, frequently updated, and contain comprehensive evaluation guidelines. The Brazilian Bar Examination meets these requirements. We introduce oab-bench, a benchmark comprising 105 questions across seven areas of law from recent editions of the exam. The benchmark includes comprehensive evaluation guidelines and reference materials used by human examiners to ensure consistent grading. We evaluate the performance of four LLMs on oab-bench, finding that Claude-3.5 Sonnet achieves the best results with an average score of 7.93 out of 10, passing all 21 exams. We also investigated whether LLMs can serve as reliable automated judges for evaluating legal writing. Our experiments show that frontier models like OpenAI's o1 achieve a strong correlation with human scores when evaluating approved exams, suggesting their potential as reliable automated evaluators despite the inherently subjective nature of legal writing assessment. The source code and the benchmark -- containing questions, evaluation guidelines, model-generated responses, and their respective automated evaluations -- are publicly available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) holds promise for revolutionizing various fields traditionally dominated by human expertise. Urban planning, a professional discipline that fundamentally shapes our daily surroundings, is one such field heavily relying on multifaceted domain knowledge and experience of human experts. The extent to which LLMs can assist human practitioners in urban planning remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark, UrbanPlanBench, tailored to evaluate the efficacy of LLMs in urban planning, which encompasses fundamental principles, professional knowledge, and management and regulations, aligning closely with the qualifications expected of human planners. Through extensive evaluation, we reveal a significant imbalance in the acquisition of planning knowledge among LLMs, with even the most proficient models falling short of meeting professional standards. For instance, we observe that 70% of LLMs achieve subpar performance in understanding planning regulations compared to other aspects. Besides the benchmark, we present the largest-ever supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset, UrbanPlanText, comprising over 30,000 instruction pairs sourced from urban planning exams and textbooks. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuned models exhibit enhanced performance in memorization tests and comprehension of urban planning knowledge, while there exists significant room for improvement, particularly in tasks requiring domain-specific terminology and reasoning. By making our benchmark, dataset, and associated evaluation and fine-tuning toolsets publicly available atthis https URL, we aim to catalyze the integration of LLMs into practical urban planning, fostering a symbiotic collaboration between human expertise and machine intelligence.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to follow instructions accurately is fundamental for Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as reliable agents in real-world applications. While existing instruction-following benchmarks are either single-turn or introduce new requirements in each turn without allowing self-correction, Meeseeks simulates realistic human-LLM interactions through an iterative feedback process. This design enables models to self-correct based on specific requirement failures, better reflecting real-world user-end usage patterns. The benchmark implements a comprehensive evaluation system with 38 capability tags organized across three dimensions: Intent Recognition, Granular Content Validation, and Output Structure Validation. Through rigorous evaluation across LLMs, Meeseeks provides valuable insights into LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in practical applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RWKV-X}, a novel hybrid architecture that combines the efficiency of RWKV for short-range modeling with a sparse attention mechanism designed to capture long-range context. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that rely on full attention layers and retain quadratic complexity, RWKV-X achieves linear-time complexity in training and constant-time complexity in inference decoding. We demonstrate that RWKV-X, when continually pretrained on 64K-token sequences, achieves near-perfect accuracy on the 64K passkey retrieval benchmark. It consistently outperforms prior RWKV-7 models on long-context benchmarks, while maintaining strong performance on short-context tasks. These results highlight RWKV-X as a scalable and efficient backbone for general-purpose language modeling, capable of decoding sequences up to 1 million tokens with stable speed and memory usage. To facilitate further research and analysis, we have made the checkpoints and the associated code publicly accessible at:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical question answering (QA) is a reasoning-intensive task that remains challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to hallucinations and outdated domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) provides a promising post-training solution by leveraging external knowledge. However, existing medical RAG systems suffer from two key limitations: (1) a lack of modeling for human-like reasoning behaviors during information retrieval, and (2) reliance on suboptimal medical corpora, which often results in the retrieval of irrelevant or noisy snippets. To overcome these challenges, we propose Discuss-RAG, a plug-and-play module designed to enhance the medical QA RAG system through collaborative agent-based reasoning. Our method introduces a summarizer agent that orchestrates a team of medical experts to emulate multi-turn brainstorming, thereby improving the relevance of retrieved content. Additionally, a decision-making agent evaluates the retrieved snippets before their final integration. Experimental results on four benchmark medical QA datasets show that Discuss-RAG consistently outperforms MedRAG, especially significantly improving answer accuracy by up to 16.67% on BioASQ and 12.20% on PubMedQA. The code is available at:this https URL.

  In this paper, we introduce PolyMath, a multilingual mathematical reasoning benchmark covering 18 languages and 4 easy-to-hard difficulty levels. Our benchmark ensures difficulty comprehensiveness, language diversity, and high-quality translation, making it a highly discriminative multilingual mathematical benchmark in the era of reasoning LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation for advanced LLMs and find that even Qwen-3-235B-A22B-Thinking and Gemini-2.5-pro, achieve only 54.6 and 52.2 benchmark scores, with about 40% accuracy under the highest level From a language perspective, our benchmark reveals several key challenges of LLMs in multilingual reasoning: (1) Reasoning performance varies widely across languages for current LLMs; (2) Input-output language consistency is low in reasoning LLMs and may be correlated with performance; (3) The thinking length differs significantly by language for current LLMs. Additionally, we demonstrate that controlling the output language in the instructions has the potential to affect reasoning performance, especially for some low-resource languages, suggesting a promising direction for improving multilingual capabilities in LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt tuning has emerged as a lightweight adaptation strategy for adapting foundation models to downstream tasks, particularly in resource-constrained systems. As pre-trained prompts have become valuable intellectual assets, combining multiple source prompts offers a promising approach to enhance generalization to new tasks by leveraging complementary knowledge from diverse sources. However, naive aggregation of these prompts often leads to representation collapse due to mutual interference, undermining their collective potential. To address these challenges, we propose HGPrompt, an adaptive framework for multi-source prompt transfer that learns optimal ensemble weights by jointly optimizing dual objectives: transferability and stability. Specifically, we first introduce an information-theoretic metric to evaluate the transferability of prompt-induced features on the target task, capturing the intrinsic alignment between the feature representations. Additionally, we propose a novel Gradient Alignment Regularization to mitigate gradient conflicts among prompts, enabling stable and coherent knowledge transfer from multiple sources while suppressing interference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale VTAB benchmark demonstrate that HGPrompt achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness in multi-source prompt transfer.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current multimodal benchmarks often conflate reasoning with domain-specific knowledge, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate general reasoning abilities in non-expert settings. To address this, we introduce VisualPuzzles, a benchmark that targets visual reasoning while deliberately minimizing reliance on specialized knowledge. VisualPuzzles consists of diverse questions spanning five categories: algorithmic, analogical, deductive, inductive, and spatial reasoning. One major source of our questions is manually translated logical reasoning questions from the Chinese Civil Service Examination. Experiments show that VisualPuzzles requires significantly less intensive domain-specific knowledge and more complex reasoning compared to benchmarks like MMMU, enabling us to better evaluate genuine multimodal reasoning. Evaluations show that state-of-the-art multimodal large language models consistently lag behind human performance on VisualPuzzles, and that strong performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks does not necessarily translate to success on reasoning-focused, knowledge-light tasks. Additionally, reasoning enhancements such as scaling up inference compute (with "thinking" modes) yield inconsistent gains across models and task types, and we observe no clear correlation between model size and performance. We also found that models exhibit different reasoning and answering patterns on VisualPuzzles compared to benchmarks with heavier emphasis on knowledge. VisualPuzzles offers a clearer lens through which to evaluate reasoning capabilities beyond factual recall and domain knowledge.

  Recent math benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) such as MathArena indicate that state-of-the-art reasoning models achieve impressive performance on mathematical competitions like AIME, with the leading model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieving scores comparable to top human competitors. However, these benchmarks evaluate models solely based on final numerical answers, neglecting rigorous reasoning and proof generation which are essential for real-world mathematical tasks. To address this, we introduce the first comprehensive evaluation of full-solution reasoning for challenging mathematical problems. Using expert human annotators, we evaluated several state-of-the-art reasoning models on the six problems from the 2025 USAMO within hours of their release. Our results reveal that all tested models struggled significantly: only Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves a non-trivial score of 25%, while all other models achieve less than 5%. Through detailed analysis of reasoning traces, we identify the most common failure modes and find several unwanted artifacts arising from the optimization strategies employed during model training. Overall, our results suggest that current LLMs are inadequate for rigorous mathematical reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for substantial improvements in reasoning and proof generation capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the evolving landscape of online communication, hate speech detection remains a formidable challenge, further compounded by the diversity of digital platforms. This study investigates the effectiveness and adaptability of pre-trained and fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) in identifying hate speech, to address two central questions: (1) To what extent does the model performance depend on the fine-tuning and training parameters?, (2) To what extent do models generalize to cross-domain hate speech detection? and (3) What are the specific features of the datasets or models that influence the generalization potential? The experiment shows that LLMs offer a huge advantage over the state-of-the-art even without pretraining. Ordinary least squares analyses suggest that the advantage of training with fine-grained hate speech labels is washed away with the increase in dataset size. While our research demonstrates the potential of large language models (LLMs) for hate speech detection, several limitations remain, particularly regarding the validity and the reproducibility of the results. We conclude with an exhaustive discussion of the challenges we faced in our experimentation and offer recommended best practices for future scholars designing benchmarking experiments of this kind.

  Achieving safe autonomous navigation systems is critical for deploying robots in dynamic and uncertain real-world environments. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical control framework leveraging neural network verification techniques to design control barrier functions (CBFs) and policy correction mechanisms that ensure safe reinforcement learning navigation policies. Our approach relies on probabilistic enumeration to identify unsafe regions of operation, which are then used to construct a safe CBF-based control layer applicable to arbitrary policies. We validate our framework both in simulation and on a real robot, using a standard mobile robot benchmark and a highly dynamic aquatic environmental monitoring task. These experiments demonstrate the ability of the proposed solution to correct unsafe actions while preserving efficient navigation behavior. Our results show the promise of developing hierarchical verification-based systems to enable safe and robust navigation behaviors in complex scenarios.

  We introduce Phi-4-reasoning, a 14-billion parameter reasoning model that achieves strong performance on complex reasoning tasks. Trained via supervised fine-tuning of Phi-4 on carefully curated set of "teachable" prompts-selected for the right level of complexity and diversity-and reasoning demonstrations generated using o3-mini, Phi-4-reasoning generates detailed reasoning chains that effectively leverage inference-time compute. We further develop Phi-4-reasoning-plus, a variant enhanced through a short phase of outcome-based reinforcement learning that offers higher performance by generating longer reasoning traces. Across a wide range of reasoning tasks, both models outperform significantly larger open-weight models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B model and approach the performance levels of full DeepSeek-R1 model. Our comprehensive evaluations span benchmarks in math and scientific reasoning, coding, algorithmic problem solving, planning, and spatial understanding. Interestingly, we observe a non-trivial transfer of improvements to general-purpose benchmarks as well. In this report, we provide insights into our training data, our training methodologies, and our evaluations. We show that the benefit of careful data curation for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) extends to reasoning language models, and can be further amplified by reinforcement learning (RL). Finally, our evaluation points to opportunities for improving how we assess the performance and robustness of reasoning models.

  The integration of reinforcement learning (RL) into the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has rapidly emerged as a transformative research direction. While MLLMs significantly extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle diverse modalities such as vision, audio, and video, enabling robust reasoning across multimodal inputs remains a major challenge. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in RL-based reasoning for MLLMs, covering key algorithmic designs, reward mechanism innovations, and practical applications. We highlight two main RL paradigms--value-free and value-based methods--and analyze how RL enhances reasoning abilities by optimizing reasoning trajectories and aligning multimodal information. Furthermore, we provide an extensive overview of benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and existing limitations, and propose future research directions to address current bottlenecks such as sparse rewards, inefficient cross-modal reasoning, and real-world deployment constraints. Our goal is to offer a comprehensive and structured guide to researchers interested in advancing RL-based reasoning in the multimodal era.

  Being able to cooperate with new people is an important component of many economically valuable AI tasks, from household robotics to autonomous driving. However, generalizing to novel humans requires training on data that captures the diversity of human behaviors. Adversarial training is one avenue for searching for such data and ensuring that agents are robust. However, it is difficult to apply in the cooperative setting because adversarial policies intentionally learn to sabotage the task instead of simulating valid cooperation partners. To address this challenge, we propose a novel strategy for overcoming self-sabotage that combines a pre-trained generative model to simulate valid cooperative agent policies with adversarial training to maximize regret. We call our method GOAT: Generative Online Adversarial Training. In this framework, the GOAT dynamically searches for and generates coordination strategies where the learning policy -- the Cooperator agent -- underperforms. GOAT enables better generalization by exposing the Cooperator to various challenging interaction scenarios. We maintain realistic coordination strategies by updating only the generative model's embedding while keeping its parameters frozen, thus avoiding adversarial exploitation. We evaluate GOAT with real human partners, and the results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the Overcooked benchmark, highlighting its effectiveness in generalizing to diverse human behaviors.
