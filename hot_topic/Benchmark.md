- **[AgentThink: A Unified Framework for Tool-Augmented Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15298)**  `arXiv:2505.15298`  `cs.RO` `cs.CL` `cs.CV`

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise for autonomous driving, yet their struggle with hallucinations, inefficient reasoning, and limited real-world validation hinders accurate perception and robust step-by-step reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce \textbf{AgentThink}, a pioneering unified framework that, for the first time, integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with dynamic, agent-style tool invocation for autonomous driving tasks. AgentThink's core innovations include: \textbf{(i) Structured Data Generation}, by establishing an autonomous driving tool library to automatically construct structured, self-verified reasoning data explicitly incorporating tool usage for diverse driving scenarios; \textbf{(ii) A Two-stage Training Pipeline}, employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to equip VLMs with the capability for autonomous tool invocation; and \textbf{(iii) Agent-style Tool-Usage Evaluation}, introducing a novel multi-tool assessment protocol to rigorously evaluate the model's tool invocation and utilization. Experiments on the DriveLMM-o1 benchmark demonstrate AgentThink significantly boosts overall reasoning scores by \textbf{53.91\%} and enhances answer accuracy by \textbf{33.54\%}, while markedly improving reasoning quality and consistency. Furthermore, ablation studies and robust zero-shot/few-shot generalization experiments across various benchmarks underscore its powerful capabilities. These findings highlight a promising trajectory for developing trustworthy and tool-aware autonomous driving models.

- **[Raw2Drive: Reinforcement Learning with Aligned World Models for End-to-End Autonomous Driving (in CARLA v2)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16394)**  `arXiv:2505.16394`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  Reinforcement Learning (RL) can mitigate the causal confusion and distribution shift inherent to imitation learning (IL). However, applying RL to end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) remains an open problem for its training difficulty, and IL is still the mainstream paradigm in both academia and industry. Recently Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) have demonstrated promising results in neural planning; however, these methods typically require privileged information as input rather than raw sensor data. We fill this gap by designing Raw2Drive, a dual-stream MBRL approach. Initially, we efficiently train an auxiliary privileged world model paired with a neural planner that uses privileged information as input. Subsequently, we introduce a raw sensor world model trained via our proposed Guidance Mechanism, which ensures consistency between the raw sensor world model and the privileged world model during rollouts. Finally, the raw sensor world model combines the prior knowledge embedded in the heads of the privileged world model to effectively guide the training of the raw sensor policy. Raw2Drive is so far the only RL based end-to-end method on CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, and Bench2Drive and it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  While autonomous driving (AD) stacks struggle with decision making under partial observability and real-world complexity, human drivers are capable of commonsense reasoning to make near-optimal decisions with limited information. Recent work has attempted to leverage finetuned Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for trajectory planning at inference time to emulate human behavior. Despite their success in benchmark evaluations, these methods are often impractical to deploy (a 70B parameter VLM inference at merely 8 tokens per second requires more than 160G of memory), and their monolithic network structure prohibits safety decomposition. To bridge this gap, we propose VLM-Embedded Reasoning for autonomous Driving (VERDI), a training-time framework that distills the reasoning process and commonsense knowledge of VLMs into the AD stack. VERDI augments modular differentiable end-to-end (e2e) AD models by aligning intermediate module outputs at the perception, prediction, and planning stages with text features explaining the driving reasoning process produced by VLMs. By encouraging alignment in latent space, \textsc{VERDI} enables the modular AD stack to internalize structured reasoning, without incurring the inference-time costs of large VLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the NuScenes dataset and find that VERDI outperforms existing e2e methods that do not embed reasoning by 10% in $\ell_{2}$ distance, while maintaining high inference speed.

- **[UAV See, UGV Do: Aerial Imagery and Virtual Teach Enabling Zero-Shot Ground Vehicle Repeat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16912)**  `arXiv:2505.16912`  `cs.RO`  
  _Desiree Fisker, Alexander Krawciw, Sven Lilge, Melissa Greeff, Timothy D. Barfoot_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents Virtual Teach and Repeat (VirT&R): an extension of the Teach and Repeat (T&R) framework that enables GPS-denied, zero-shot autonomous ground vehicle navigation in untraversed environments. VirT&R leverages aerial imagery captured for a target environment to train a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model so that dense point clouds and photo-textured meshes can be extracted. The NeRF mesh is used to create a high-fidelity simulation of the environment for piloting an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to virtually define a desired path. The mission can then be executed in the actual target environment by using NeRF-derived point cloud submaps associated along the path and an existing LiDAR Teach and Repeat (LT&R) framework. We benchmark the repeatability of VirT&R on over 12 km of autonomous driving data using physical markings that allow a sim-to-real lateral path-tracking error to be obtained and compared with LT&R. VirT&R achieved measured root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 19.5 cm and 18.4 cm in two different environments, which are slightly less than one tire width (24 cm) on the robot used for testing, and respective maximum errors were 39.4 cm and 47.6 cm. This was done using only the NeRF-derived teach map, demonstrating that VirT&R has similar closed-loop path-tracking performance to LT&R but does not require a human to manually teach the path to the UGV in the actual environment.

- **[D-LIO: 6DoF Direct LiDAR-Inertial Odometry based on Simultaneous Truncated Distance Field Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16726)**  `arXiv:2505.16726`  `cs.RO`  
  _Lucia Coto-Elena, J.E. Maese, L. Merino, F. Caballero_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a new approach for 6DoF Direct LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (D-LIO) based on the simultaneous mapping of truncated distance fields on CPU. Such continuous representation (in the vicinity of the points) enables working with raw 3D LiDAR data online, avoiding the need of LiDAR feature selection and tracking, simplifying the odometry pipeline and easily generalizing to many scenarios. The method is based on the proposed Fast Truncated Distance Field (Fast-TDF) method as a convenient tool to represent the environment. Such representation enables i) solving the LiDAR point-cloud registration as a nonlinear optimization process without the need of selecting/tracking LiDAR features in the input data, ii) simultaneously producing an accurate truncated distance field map of the environment, and iii) updating such map at constant time independently of its size. The approach is tested using open datasets, aerial and ground. It is also benchmarked against other state-of-the-art odometry approaches, demonstrating the same or better level of accuracy with the added value of an online-generated TDF representation of the environment, that can be used for other robotics tasks as planning or collision avoidance.

- **[TacCompress: A Benchmark for Multi-Point Tactile Data Compression in Dexterous Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16289)**  `arXiv:2505.16289`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yang Li, Yan Zhao, Zhengxue Cheng, Hengdi Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Though robotic dexterous manipulation has progressed substantially recently, challenges like in-hand occlusion still necessitate fine-grained tactile perception, leading to the integration of more tactile sensors into robotic hands. Consequently, the increased data volume imposes substantial bandwidth pressure on signal transmission from the hand's controller. However, the acquisition and compression of multi-point tactile signals based on the dexterous hands' physical structures have not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a Multi-Point Tactile Dataset for Dexterous Hand Grasping (Dex-MPTD). This dataset captures tactile signals from multiple contact sensors across various objects and grasping poses, offering a comprehensive benchmark for advancing dexterous robotic manipulation research. Second, we investigate both lossless and lossy compression on Dex-MPTD by converting tactile data into images and applying six lossless and five lossy image codecs for efficient compression. Experimental results demonstrate that tactile data can be losslessly compressed to as low as 0.0364 bits per sub-sample (bpss), achieving approximately 200$\times$ compression ratio compared to the raw tactile data. Efficient lossy compressors like HM and VTM can achieve about 1000x data reductions while preserving acceptable data fidelity. The exploration of lossy compression also reveals that screen-content-targeted coding tools outperform general-purpose codecs in compressing tactile data.

- **[GraspMolmo: Generalizable Task-Oriented Grasping via Large-Scale Synthetic Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13441)**  `arXiv:2505.13441`  `cs.RO`  
  _Abhay Deshpande, Yuquan Deng, Arijit Ray, Jordi Salvador, Winson Han, Jiafei Duan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present GrasMolmo, a generalizable open-vocabulary task-oriented grasping (TOG) model. GraspMolmo predicts semantically appropriate, stable grasps conditioned on a natural language instruction and a single RGB-D frame. For instance, given "pour me some tea", GraspMolmo selects a grasp on a teapot handle rather than its body. Unlike prior TOG methods, which are limited by small datasets, simplistic language, and uncluttered scenes, GraspMolmo learns from PRISM, a novel large-scale synthetic dataset of 379k samples featuring cluttered environments and diverse, realistic task descriptions. We fine-tune the Molmo visual-language model on this data, enabling GraspMolmo to generalize to novel open-vocabulary instructions and objects. In challenging real-world evaluations, GraspMolmo achieves state-of-the-art results, with a 70% prediction success on complex tasks, compared to the 35% achieved by the next best alternative. GraspMolmo also successfully demonstrates the ability to predict semantically correct bimanual grasps zero-shot. We release our synthetic dataset, code, model, and benchmarks to accelerate research in task-semantic robotic manipulation, which, along with videos, are available atthis https URL.

- **[QLLM: Do We Really Need a Mixing Network for Credit Assignment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12961)**  `arXiv:2504.12961`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhouyang Jiang, Bin Zhang, Airong Wei, Zhiwei Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Credit assignment has remained a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Previous studies have primarily addressed this issue through value decomposition methods under the centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm, where neural networks are utilized to approximate the nonlinear relationship between individual Q-values and the global Q-value. Although these approaches have achieved considerable success in various benchmark tasks, they still suffer from several limitations, including imprecise attribution of contributions, limited interpretability, and poor scalability in high-dimensional state spaces. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm, \textbf{QLLM}, which facilitates the automatic construction of credit assignment functions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the concept of \textbf{TFCAF} is introduced, wherein the credit allocation process is represented as a direct and expressive nonlinear functional formulation. A custom-designed \textit{coder-evaluator} framework is further employed to guide the generation, verification, and refinement of executable code by LLMs, significantly mitigating issues such as hallucination and shallow reasoning during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on several standard MARL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, QLLM exhibits strong generalization capability and maintains compatibility with a wide range of MARL algorithms that utilize mixing networks, positioning it as a promising and versatile solution for complex multi-agent scenarios.

- **[Multi-Agent Corridor Generating Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12397)**  `arXiv:2410.12397`  `cs.MA`  
  _Arseniy Pertzovsky, Roni Stern, Roie Zivan, Ariel Felner_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose the Multi-Agent Corridor Generating Algorithm (MACGA) for solving the Multi-agent Pathfinding (MAPF) problem, where a group of agents need to find non-colliding paths to their target locations. Existing approaches struggle to solve dense MAPF instances. In MACGA, the agents build \emph{corridors}, which are sequences of connected vertices, from current locations towards agents' goals, and evacuate other agents out of the corridors to avoid collisions and deadlocks. We also present the MACGA+PIBT algorithm, which integrates the well-known rule-based PIBT algorithm into MACGA to improve runtime and solution quality. The proposed algorithms run in polynomial time and have a reachability property, i.e., every agent is guaranteed to reach its goal location at some point. We demonstrate experimentally that MACGA and MACGA+PIBT outperform baseline algorithms in terms of success rate, runtime, and makespan across diverse MAPF benchmark grids.

- **[GradPCA: Leveraging NTK Alignment for Reliable Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16017)**  `arXiv:2505.16017`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Mariia Seleznova, Hung-Hsu Chou, Claudio Mayrink Verdun, Gitta Kutyniok_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce GradPCA, an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection method that exploits the low-rank structure of neural network gradients induced by Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) alignment. GradPCA applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to gradient class-means, achieving more consistent performance than existing methods across standard image classification benchmarks. We provide a theoretical perspective on spectral OOD detection in neural networks to support GradPCA, highlighting feature-space properties that enable effective detection and naturally emerge from NTK alignment. Our analysis further reveals that feature quality -- particularly the use of pretrained versus non-pretrained representations -- plays a crucial role in determining which detectors will succeed. Extensive experiments validate the strong performance of GradPCA, and our theoretical framework offers guidance for designing more principled spectral OOD detectors.

- **[Split Gibbs Discrete Diffusion Posterior Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01161)**  `arXiv:2503.01161`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Wenda Chu, Zihui Wu, Yifan Chen, Yang Song, Yisong Yue_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the problem of posterior sampling in discrete-state spaces using discrete diffusion models. While posterior sampling methods for continuous diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress, analogous methods for discrete diffusion models remain challenging. In this work, we introduce a principled plug-and-play discrete diffusion posterior sampling algorithm based on split Gibbs sampling, which we call SGDD. Our algorithm enables reward-guided generation and solving inverse problems in discrete-state spaces. We demonstrate the convergence of SGDD to the target posterior distribution and verify this through controlled experiments on synthetic benchmarks. Our method enjoys state-of-the-art posterior sampling performance on a range of benchmarks for discrete data, including DNA sequence design, discrete image inverse problems, and music infilling, achieving more than 30% improved performance compared to existing baselines.

- **[ATR-Bench: A Federated Learning Benchmark for Adaptation, Trust, and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16850)**  `arXiv:2505.16850`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL` `cs.CV`  
  _Tajamul Ashraf, Mohammed Mohsen Peerzada, Moloud Abdar, Yutong Xie, Yuyin Zhou, Xiaofeng Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative model training while preserving data privacy across decentralized participants. As FL adoption grows, numerous techniques have been proposed to tackle its practical challenges. However, the lack of standardized evaluation across key dimensions hampers systematic progress and fair comparison of FL methods. In this work, we introduce ATR-Bench, a unified framework for analyzing federated learning through three foundational dimensions: Adaptation, Trust, and Reasoning. We provide an in-depth examination of the conceptual foundations, task formulations, and open research challenges associated with each theme. We have extensively benchmarked representative methods and datasets for adaptation to heterogeneous clients and trustworthiness in adversarial or unreliable environments. Due to the lack of reliable metrics and models for reasoning in FL, we only provide literature-driven insights for this dimension. ATR-Bench lays the groundwork for a systematic and holistic evaluation of federated learning with real-world relevance. We will make our complete codebase publicly accessible and a curated repository that continuously tracks new developments and research in the FL literature.

- **[HyperMARL: Adaptive Hypernetworks for Multi-Agent RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04233)**  `arXiv:2412.04233`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.MA`  
  _Kale-ab Abebe Tessera, Arrasy Rahman, Amos Storkey, Stefano V. Albrecht_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adaptability to specialised or homogeneous behaviours is critical in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Parameter sharing (PS) techniques, common for efficient adaptation, often limit behavioural diversity due to cross-agent gradient interference, which we show can be exacerbated by the coupling of observations and agent IDs. Current remedies typically add complexity through altered objectives, manual preset diversity levels, or sequential updates. We ask: can shared policies adapt without these complexities? We propose HyperMARL, a PS approach using hypernetworks for dynamic agent-specific parameters, without altering the RL objective or requiring preset diversity levels. HyperMARL's explicit decoupling of observation- and agent-conditioned gradients empirically reduces policy gradient variance, facilitates shared-policy adaptation (including specialisation), and helps mitigate cross-agent interference. Across diverse MARL benchmarks (up to 20 agents), requiring homogeneous, heterogeneous, or mixed behaviours, HyperMARL achieves competitive performance against key baselines -- fully shared, non-parameter sharing, and three diversity-promoting methods -- while preserving behavioural diversity comparable to non-parameter sharing. These findings establish HyperMARL as a versatile approach for adaptive MARL. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[Logit Scaling for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01175)**  `arXiv:2409.01175`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Andrija Djurisic, Rosanne Liu, Mladen Nikolic_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The safe deployment of machine learning and AI models in open-world settings hinges critically on the ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data accurately, data samples that contrast vastly from what the model was trained with. Current approaches to OOD detection often require further training the model, and/or statistics about the training data which may no longer be accessible. Additionally, many existing OOD detection methods struggle to maintain performance when transferred across different architectures. Our research tackles these issues by proposing a simple, post-hoc method that does not require access to the training data distribution, keeps a trained network intact, and holds strong performance across a variety of architectures. Our method, Logit Scaling (LTS), as the name suggests, simply scales the logits in a manner that effectively distinguishes between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. We tested our method on benchmarks across various scales, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet and OpenOOD. The experiments cover 3 ID and 14 OOD datasets, as well as 9 model architectures. Overall, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, robustness and adaptability across different architectures, paving the way towards a universally applicable solution for advanced OOD detection.

  Despite recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning, the training recipe for building high-performing reasoning models remains elusive. Key implementation details of frontier models, such as DeepSeek-R1, including data curation strategies and RL training recipe, are often omitted. Moreover, recent research indicates distillation remains more effective than RL for smaller models. In this work, we demonstrate that large-scale RL can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of strong, small- and mid-sized models, achieving results that surpass those of state-of-the-art distillation-based models. We systematically study the RL training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective approach: first training on math-only prompts, then on code-only prompts. Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks (e.g., +14.6% / +17.2% on AIME 2025 for the 7B / 14B models), but also code reasoning tasks (e.g., +6.8% / +5.8% on LiveCodeBench for the 7B / 14B models). In addition, extended code-only RL iterations further improve performance on code benchmarks with minimal or no degradation in math results. We develop a robust data curation pipeline to collect challenging prompts with high-quality, verifiable answers and test cases to enable verification-based RL across both domains. Finally, we identify key experimental insights, including curriculum learning with progressively increasing response lengths and the stabilizing effect of on-policy parameter updates. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational reasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.

- **[AdaSTaR: Adaptive Data Sampling for Training Self-Taught Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16322)**  `arXiv:2505.16322`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Woosung Koh, Wonbeen Oh, Jaein Jang, MinHyung Lee, Hyeongjin Kim, Ah Yeon Kim, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-Taught Reasoners (STaR), synonymously known as Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT), is an integral part of the training pipeline of self-improving reasoning Language Models (LMs). The self-improving mechanism often employs random observation (data) sampling. However, this results in trained observation imbalance; inefficiently over-training on solved examples while under-training on challenging ones. In response, we introduce Adaptive STaR (AdaSTaR), a novel algorithm that rectifies this by integrating two adaptive sampling principles: (1) Adaptive Sampling for Diversity: promoting balanced training across observations, and (2) Adaptive Sampling for Curriculum: dynamically adjusting data difficulty to match the model's evolving strength. Across six benchmarks, AdaSTaR achieves best test accuracy in all instances (6/6) and reduces training FLOPs by an average of 58.6% against an extensive list of baselines. These improvements in performance and efficiency generalize to different pre-trained LMs and larger models, paving the way for more efficient and effective self-improving LMs.

  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by optimizing their policies with reward signals. Yet, RL's success relies on the reliability of rewards, which are provided by verifiers. In this paper, we expose and analyze a widespread problem--false negatives--where verifiers wrongly reject correct model outputs. Our in-depth study of the Big-Math-RL-Verified dataset reveals that over 38% of model-generated responses suffer from false negatives, where the verifier fails to recognize correct answers. We show, both empirically and theoretically, that these false negatives severely impair RL training by depriving the model of informative gradient signals and slowing convergence. To mitigate this, we propose tinyV, a lightweight LLM-based verifier that augments existing rule-based methods, which dynamically identifies potential false negatives and recovers valid responses to produce more accurate reward estimates. Across multiple math-reasoning benchmarks, integrating TinyV boosts pass rates by up to 10% and accelerates convergence relative to the baseline. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing verifier false negatives and offer a practical approach to improve RL-based fine-tuning of LLMs. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Transformers for molecular property prediction: Domain adaptation efficiently improves performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03360)**  `arXiv:2503.03360`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Afnan Sultan, Max Rausch-Dupont, Shahrukh Khan, Olga Kalinina, Dietrich Klakow, Andrea Volkamer_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Over the past six years, molecular transformer models have become key tools in drug discovery. Most existing models are pre-trained on large, unlabeled datasets such as ZINC or ChEMBL. However, the extent to which large-scale pre-training improves molecular property prediction remains unclear. This study evaluates transformer models for this task while addressing their limitations. We explore how pre-training dataset size and chemically informed objectives impact performance. Our results show that increasing the dataset beyond approximately 400K to 800K molecules from large-scale unlabeled databases does not enhance performance across seven datasets covering five ADME endpoints: lipophilicity, permeability, solubility (two datasets), microsomal stability (two datasets), and plasma protein binding. In contrast, domain adaptation on a small, domain-specific dataset (less than or equal 4K molecules) using multi-task regression of physicochemical properties significantly boosts performance (P-value less than 0.001). A model pre-trained on 400K molecules and adapted with domain-specific data outperforms larger models such as MolFormer and performs comparably to MolBERT. Benchmarks against Random Forest (RF) baselines using descriptors and Morgan fingerprints show that chemically and physically informed features consistently yield better performance across model types. While RF remains a strong baseline, we identify concrete practices to enhance transformer performance. Aligning pre-training and adaptation with chemically meaningful tasks and domain-relevant data presents a promising direction for molecular property prediction. Our models are available on HuggingFace for easy use and adaptation.

  _Tillmann Rheude, Roland Eils, Benjamin Wild_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-world machine learning applications often involve data from multiple modalities that must be integrated effectively to make robust predictions. However, in many practical settings, not all modalities are available for every sample, and acquiring additional modalities can be costly. This raises the question: which samples should be prioritized for additional modality acquisition when resources are limited? While prior work has explored individual-level acquisition strategies and training-time active learning paradigms, test-time and cohort-based acquisition remain underexplored despite their importance in many real-world settings. We introduce Cohort-based Active Modality Acquisition (CAMA), a novel test-time setting to formalize the challenge of selecting which samples should receive additional modalities. We derive acquisition strategies that leverage a combination of generative imputation and discriminative modeling to estimate the expected benefit of acquiring missing modalities based on common evaluation metrics. We also introduce upper-bound heuristics that provide performance ceilings to benchmark acquisition strategies. Experiments on common multimodal datasets demonstrate that our proposed imputation-based strategies can more effectively guide the acquisition of new samples in comparison to those relying solely on unimodal information, entropy guidance, and random selections. Our work provides an effective solution for optimizing modality acquisition at the cohort level, enabling better utilization of resources in constrained settings.

- **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790)**  `arXiv:2505.16790`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Hyunjin Seo, Taewon Kim, Sihyun Yu, SungSoo Ahn_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.

- **[Your Pre-trained LLM is Secretly an Unsupervised Confidence Calibrator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16690)**  `arXiv:2505.16690`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Beier Luo, Shuoyuan Wang, Yixuan Li, Hongxin Wei_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks. While PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language models (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to both correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical applications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled data for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Disagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to optimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\tau$) in post-hoc confidence calibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by prediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their confidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence underestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a larger $\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by selectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively decoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an overly large $\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples, improving calibration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, improving the average ECE of open-sourced and API-based LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o) by up to 15.08$\%$ on common benchmarks.

  How to design reinforcement learning (RL) tasks that effectively unleash the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) remains an open question. Existing RL tasks (e.g., math, programming, and constructing reasoning tasks) suffer from three key limitations: (1) Scalability. They rely heavily on human annotation or expensive LLM synthesis to generate sufficient training data. (2) Verifiability. LLMs' outputs are hard to verify automatically and reliably. (3) Controllable Difficulty. Most tasks lack fine-grained difficulty control, making it hard to train LLMs to develop reasoning ability from easy to hard.To address these limitations, we propose Saturn, a SAT-based RL framework that uses Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems to train and evaluate LLM reasoning. Saturn enables scalable task construction, rule-based verification, and precise difficulty control. Saturn designs a curriculum learning pipeline that continuously improves LLMs' reasoning capability by constructing SAT tasks of increasing difficulty and training LLMs from easy to hard. To ensure stable training, we design a principled mechanism to control difficulty transitions.We introduce Saturn-2.6k, a dataset of 2,660 SAT problems with varying difficulty. It supports the evaluation of how LLM reasoning changes with problem difficulty. We apply Saturn to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen and obtain Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B. We achieve several notable results: (1) On SAT problems, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B achieve average pass@3 improvements of +14.0 and +28.1, respectively. (2) On math and programming tasks, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B improve average scores by +4.9 and +1.8 on benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench). (3) Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach in constructing RL tasks, Saturn achieves further improvements of +8.8%. We release the source code, data, and models to support future research.

  We introduce Equivariant Neural Eikonal Solvers, a novel framework that integrates Equivariant Neural Fields (ENFs) with Neural Eikonal Solvers. Our approach employs a single neural field where a unified shared backbone is conditioned on signal-specific latent variables - represented as point clouds in a Lie group - to model diverse Eikonal solutions. The ENF integration ensures equivariant mapping from these latent representations to the solution field, delivering three key benefits: enhanced representation efficiency through weight-sharing, robust geometric grounding, and solution steerability. This steerability allows transformations applied to the latent point cloud to induce predictable, geometrically meaningful modifications in the resulting Eikonal solution. By coupling these steerable representations with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), our framework accurately models Eikonal travel-time solutions while generalizing to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds with regular group actions. This includes homogeneous spaces such as Euclidean, position-orientation, spherical, and hyperbolic manifolds. We validate our approach through applications in seismic travel-time modeling of 2D and 3D benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance, scalability, adaptability, and user controllability compared to existing Neural Operator-based Eikonal solver methods.

  The rapid expansion of distributed photovoltaic (PV) installations worldwide, many being behind-the-meter systems, has significantly challenged energy management and grid operations, as unobservable PV generation further complicates the supply-demand balance. Therefore, estimating this generation from net load, known as PV disaggregation, is critical. Given privacy concerns and the need for large training datasets, federated learning becomes a promising approach, but statistical heterogeneity, arising from geographical and behavioral variations among prosumers, poses new challenges to PV disaggregation. To overcome these challenges, a privacy-preserving distributed PV disaggregation framework is proposed using Personalized Federated Learning (PFL). The proposed method employs a two-level framework that combines local and global modeling. At the local level, a transformer-based PV disaggregation model is designed to generate solar irradiance embeddings for representing local PV conditions. A novel adaptive local aggregation mechanism is adopted to mitigate the impact of statistical heterogeneity on the local model, extracting a portion of global information that benefits the local model. At the global level, a central server aggregates information uploaded from multiple data centers, preserving privacy while enabling cross-center knowledge sharing. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed framework, showing improved accuracy and robustness compared to benchmark methods.

  Episodic tasks in Reinforcement Learning (RL) often pose challenges due to sparse reward signals and high-dimensional state spaces, which hinder efficient learning. Additionally, these tasks often feature hidden "trap states" -- irreversible failures that prevent task completion but do not provide explicit negative rewards to guide agents away from repeated errors. To address these issues, we propose Time-Weighted Contrastive Reward Learning (TW-CRL), an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that leverages both successful and failed demonstrations. By incorporating temporal information, TW-CRL learns a dense reward function that identifies critical states associated with success or failure. This approach not only enables agents to avoid trap states but also encourages meaningful exploration beyond simple imitation of expert trajectories. Empirical evaluations on navigation tasks and robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that TW-CRL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving improved efficiency and robustness.

  Reinforcement learning has achieved significant milestones, but sample efficiency remains a bottleneck for real-world applications. Recently, CrossQ has demonstrated state-of-the-art sample efficiency with a low update-to-data (UTD) ratio of 1. In this work, we explore CrossQ's scaling behavior with higher UTD ratios. We identify challenges in the training dynamics, which are emphasized by higher UTD ratios. To address these, we integrate weight normalization into the CrossQ framework, a solution that stabilizes training, has been shown to prevent potential loss of plasticity and keeps the effective learning rate constant. Our proposed approach reliably scales with increasing UTD ratios, achieving competitive performance across 25 challenging continuous control tasks on the DeepMind Control Suite and Myosuite benchmarks, notably the complex dog and humanoid environments. This work eliminates the need for drastic interventions, such as network resets, and offers a simple yet robust pathway for improving sample efficiency and scalability in model-free reinforcement learning.

  Diffusion models, while powerful, can inadvertently generate harmful or undesirable content, raising significant ethical and safety concerns. Recent machine unlearning approaches offer potential solutions but often lack transparency, making it difficult to understand the changes they introduce to the base model. In this work, we introduce SAeUron, a novel method leveraging features learned by sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to remove unwanted concepts in text-to-image diffusion models. First, we demonstrate that SAEs, trained in an unsupervised manner on activations from multiple denoising timesteps of the diffusion model, capture sparse and interpretable features corresponding to specific concepts. Building on this, we propose a feature selection method that enables precise interventions on model activations to block targeted content while preserving overall performance. Our evaluation shows that SAeUron outperforms existing approaches on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark for concepts and style unlearning, and effectively eliminates nudity when evaluated with I2P. Moreover, we show that with a single SAE, we can remove multiple concepts simultaneously and that in contrast to other methods, SAeUron mitigates the possibility of generating unwanted content under adversarial attack.

  Machine learning (ML) models benefit from large datasets. Collecting data in biomedical domains is costly and challenging, hence, combining datasets has become a common practice. However, datasets obtained under different conditions could present undesired site-specific variability. Data harmonization methods aim to remove site-specific variance while retaining biologically relevant information. This study evaluates the effectiveness of popularly used ComBat-based methods for harmonizing data in scenarios where the class balance is not equal across sites. We find that these methods struggle with data leakage issues. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach PrettYharmonize, designed to harmonize data by pretending the target labels. We validate our approach using controlled datasets designed to benchmark the utility of harmonization. Finally, using real-world MRI and clinical data, we compare leakage-prone methods with PrettYharmonize and show that it achieves comparable performance while avoiding data leakage, particularly in site-target-dependence scenarios.

  Real-world time series inference requires more than point forecasting. It demands multi-step reasoning, constraint handling, domain knowledge incorporation, and domain-specific workflow assembly. Existing time series foundation models are limited to narrow tasks and lack flexibility to generalize across diverse scenarios. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) struggle with numerical precision. To address these limitations, we introduce TS-Reasoner, a Domain-Oriented Time Series Agent that integrates natural language reasoning with precise numerical execution. TS-Reasoner decomposes natural language instructions into structured workflows composed of statistical, logical, and domain-specific operators, and incorporates a self-refinement mechanism for adaptive execution. We evaluate its capabilities through two axes: basic time series understanding and complex multi-step inference, using the TimeSeriesExam benchmark and a newly constructed dataset. Experimental results show that TS-Reasoner significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs, highlighting the promise of domain-specialized agents for robust and interpretable time series reasoning.

  Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated considerable potential in supporting model design and optimization for combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. However, much of the progress to date has been evaluated on small-scale, synthetic datasets, raising concerns about the practical effectiveness of ML-based solvers in real-world, large-scale CO scenarios. Additionally, many existing CO benchmarks lack sufficient training data, limiting their utility for evaluating data-driven approaches. To address these limitations, we introduce FrontierCO, a comprehensive benchmark that covers eight canonical CO problem types and evaluates 16 representative ML-based solvers--including graph neural networks and large language model (LLM) agents. FrontierCO features challenging instances drawn from industrial applications and frontier CO research, offering both realistic problem difficulty and abundant training data. Our empirical results provide critical insights into the strengths and limitations of current ML methods, helping to guide more robust and practically relevant advances at the intersection of machine learning and combinatorial optimization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has gained traction as a powerful paradigm for learning control policies from pre-collected data, eliminating the need for costly or risky online interactions. While many open-source libraries offer robust implementations of offline RL algorithms, they all rely on datasets composed of experience tuples consisting of state, action, next state, and reward. Managing, curating, and distributing such datasets requires suitable infrastructure. Although static datasets exist for established benchmark problems, no standardized or scalable solution supports developing and sharing datasets for novel or user-defined benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce PyTupli, a Python-based tool to streamline the creation, storage, and dissemination of benchmark environments and their corresponding tuple datasets. PyTupli includes a lightweight client library with defined interfaces for uploading and retrieving benchmarks and data. It supports fine-grained filtering at both the episode and tuple level, allowing researchers to curate high-quality, task-specific datasets. A containerized server component enables production-ready deployment with authentication, access control, and automated certificate provisioning for secure use. By addressing key barriers in dataset infrastructure, PyTupli facilitates more collaborative, reproducible, and scalable offline RL research.

  Causal discovery for dynamical systems poses a major challenge in fields where active interventions are infeasible. Most methods used to investigate these systems and their associated benchmarks are tailored to deterministic, low-dimensional and weakly nonlinear time-series data. To address these limitations, we present CausalDynamics, a large-scale benchmark and extensible data generation framework to advance the structural discovery of dynamical causal models. Our benchmark consists of true causal graphs derived from thousands of coupled ordinary and stochastic differential equations as well as two idealized climate models. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms for graph reconstruction on systems with noisy, confounded, and lagged dynamics. CausalDynamics consists of a plug-and-play, build-your-own coupling workflow that enables the construction of a hierarchy of physical systems. We anticipate that our framework will facilitate the development of robust causal discovery algorithms that are broadly applicable across domains while addressing their unique challenges. We provide a user-friendly implementation and documentation onthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly recognized as powerful tools for scientific discovery, particularly in molecular science. A fundamental requirement for these models is the ability to accurately understand molecular structures, commonly encoded in the SMILES representation. However, current LLMs struggle to interpret SMILES, even failing to carry out basic tasks such as counting molecular rings. To address this limitation, we introduce CLEANMOL, a novel framework that formulates SMILES parsing into a suite of clean and deterministic tasks explicitly designed to promote graph-level molecular comprehension. These tasks span from subgraph matching to global graph matching, providing structured supervision aligned with molecular structural properties. We construct a molecular pretraining dataset with adaptive difficulty scoring and pre-train open-source LLMs on these tasks. Our results show that CLEANMOL not only enhances structural comprehension but also achieves the best or competes with the baseline on the Mol-Instructions benchmark.

  Differential Transformer has recently gained significant attention for its impressive empirical performance, often attributed to its ability to perform noise canceled attention. However, precisely how differential attention achieves its empirical benefits remains poorly understood. Moreover, Differential Transformer architecture demands large-scale training from scratch, hindering utilization of open pretrained weights. In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation of Differential Transformer, uncovering three key factors behind its success: (1) enhanced expressivity via negative attention, (2) reduced redundancy among attention heads, and (3) improved learning dynamics. Based on these findings, we propose DEX, a novel method to efficiently integrate the advantages of differential attention into pretrained language models. By reusing the softmax attention scores and adding a lightweight differential operation on the output value matrix, DEX effectively incorporates the key advantages of differential attention while remaining lightweight in both training and inference. Evaluations confirm that DEX substantially improves the pretrained LLMs across diverse benchmarks, achieving significant performance gains with minimal adaptation data (< 0.01\%).

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made impressive progress in many applications in recent years. However, chemical MLLMs that can handle cross-modal understanding and generation remain underexplored. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose ChemMLLM, a unified chemical multimodal large language model for molecule understanding and generation. Also, we design five multimodal tasks across text, molecular SMILES strings, and image, and curate the datasets. We benchmark ChemMLLM against a range of general leading MLLMs and Chemical LLMs on these tasks. Experimental results show that ChemMLLM achieves superior performance across all evaluated tasks. For example, in molecule image optimization task, ChemMLLM outperforms the best baseline (GPT-4o) by 118.9\% (4.27 vs 1.95 property improvement). The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  Accurate demand estimation is critical for the retail business in guiding the inventory and pricing policies of perishable products. However, it faces fundamental challenges from censored sales data during stockouts, where unobserved demand creates systemic policy biases. Existing datasets lack the temporal resolution and annotations needed to address this censoring effect. To fill this gap, we present FreshRetailNet-50K, the first large-scale benchmark for censored demand estimation. It comprises 50,000 store-product time series of detailed hourly sales data from 898 stores in 18 major cities, encompassing 863 perishable SKUs meticulously annotated for stockout events. The hourly stock status records unique to this dataset, combined with rich contextual covariates, including promotional discounts, precipitation, and temporal features, enable innovative research beyond existing solutions. We demonstrate one such use case of two-stage demand modeling: first, we reconstruct the latent demand during stockouts using precise hourly annotations. We then leverage the recovered demand to train robust demand forecasting models in the second stage. Experimental results show that this approach achieves a 2.73\% improvement in prediction accuracy while reducing the systematic demand underestimation from 7.37\% to near-zero bias. With unprecedented temporal granularity and comprehensive real-world information, FreshRetailNet-50K opens new research directions in demand imputation, perishable inventory optimization, and causal retail analytics. The unique annotation quality and scale of the dataset address long-standing limitations in retail AI, providing immediate solutions and a platform for future methodological innovation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most existing multivariate time series forecasting methods adopt an all-to-all paradigm that feeds all variable histories into a unified model to predict their future values without distinguishing their individual roles. However, this undifferentiated paradigm makes it difficult to identify variable-specific causal influences and often entangles causally relevant information with spurious correlations. To address this limitation, we propose an all-to-one forecasting paradigm that predicts each target variable separately. Specifically, we first construct a Structural Causal Model from observational data and then, for each target variable, we partition the historical sequence into four sub-segments according to the inferred causal structure: endogenous, direct causal, collider causal, and spurious correlation. The prediction relies solely on the first three causally relevant sub-segments, while the spurious correlation sub-segment is excluded. Furthermore, we propose Causal Informed Transformer (CAIFormer), a novel forecasting model comprising three components: Endogenous Sub-segment Prediction Block, Direct Causal Sub-segment Prediction Block, and Collider Causal Sub-segment Prediction Block, which process the endogenous, direct causal, and collider causal sub-segments, respectively. Their outputs are then combined to produce the final prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the CAIFormer.

  Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a powerful post-training paradigm for aligning large language models with human preferences. A core challenge in RLHF is constructing accurate reward signals, where the conventional Bradley-Terry reward models (BT RMs) often suffer from sensitivity to data size and coverage, as well as vulnerability to reward hacking. Generative reward models (GenRMs) offer a more robust alternative by generating chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales followed by a final reward. However, existing GenRMs rely on shallow, vertically scaled reasoning, limiting their capacity to handle nuanced or complex (e.g., reasoning-intensive) tasks. Moreover, their pairwise preference outputs are incompatible with standard RLHF algorithms that require pointwise reward signals. In this work, we introduce Think-RM, a training framework that enables long-horizon reasoning in GenRMs by modeling an internal thinking process. Rather than producing structured, externally provided rationales, Think-RM generates flexible, self-guided reasoning traces that support advanced capabilities such as self-reflection, hypothetical reasoning, and divergent reasoning. To elicit these reasoning abilities, we first warm-up the models by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over long CoT data. We then further improve the model's long-horizon abilities by rule-based reinforcement learning (RL). In addition, we propose a novel pairwise RLHF pipeline that directly optimizes policies using pairwise preference rewards, eliminating the need for pointwise reward conversion and enabling more effective use of Think-RM outputs. Experiments show that Think-RM achieves state-of-the-art results on RM-Bench, outperforming both BT RM and vertically scaled GenRM by 8%. When combined with our pairwise RLHF pipeline, it demonstrates superior end-policy performance compared to traditional approaches.

  Tabular data, owing to its ubiquitous presence in real-world domains, has garnered significant attention in machine learning research. While tree-based models have long dominated tabular machine learning tasks, the recently proposed deep learning model TabPFN v2 has emerged, demonstrating unparalleled performance and scalability potential. Although extensive research has been conducted on TabPFN v2 to further improve performance, the majority of this research remains confined to closed environments, neglecting the challenges that frequently arise in open environments. This raises the question: Can TabPFN v2 maintain good performance in open environments? To this end, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of TabPFN v2's adaptability in open environments. We construct a unified evaluation framework covering various real-world challenges and assess the robustness of TabPFN v2 under open environments scenarios using this framework. Empirical results demonstrate that TabPFN v2 shows significant limitations in open environments but is suitable for small-scale, covariate-shifted, and class-balanced tasks. Tree-based models remain the optimal choice for general tabular tasks in open environments. To facilitate future research on open environments challenges, we advocate for open environments tabular benchmarks, multi-metric evaluation, and universal modules to strengthen model robustness. We publicly release our evaluation framework atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Transformers, leveraging the global attention to capture long-range dependencies in graph structures, have significantly advanced graph machine learning, but face prohibitive computational complexity. Tokenized Graph Learning Models (TGLMs) address this issue by converting graphs into ordered token lists for scalable processing. Besides, TGLMs also empower Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle text-attributed graphs more effectively and thus are also employed in Graph LLMs. However, existing TGLMs rely on hand-designed token lists and their adaptability to diverse graph learning scenarios remains unexplored. In this paper, we first conduct extensive empirical and theoretical preliminary studies for hand-designed token lists. Surprisingly, we identify an unexplored hop-overpriority problem: the common pre-defined token lists overemphasize nearby nodes and overwhelm the ability of TGLMs to balance local and global signals. This phenomenon is especially harmful for heterophilic graphs. To address this problem, we propose the Learnable Graph Token List (LGTL), a plug-and-play module to replace hand-designed token lists in TGLMs. Specifically, LGTL adaptively adjusts the weights across hops and prioritizes informative nodes within hops through a graph attention gate module and a selection module, respectively. In this way, contextually informative nodes can be adaptively emphasized for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Besides, we theoretically show that LGTL can address the hop-overpriority problem. Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the efficacy of LGTL across both Graph Transformers and Graph LLM backbones.

  While Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has attracted considerable attention in the field of graph self-supervised learning, its performance heavily relies on data augmentations that are expected to generate semantically consistent positive pairs. Existing strategies typically resort to random perturbations or local structure preservation, yet lack explicit control over global structural consistency between augmented views. To address this limitation, we propose Fractal Graph Contrastive Learning (FractalGCL), a theory-driven framework that leverages fractal self-similarity to enforce global topological coherence. FractalGCL introduces two key innovations: a renormalisation-based augmentation that generates structurally aligned positive views via box coverings; and a fractal-dimension-aware contrastive loss that aligns graph embeddings according to their fractal dimensions. While combining the two innovations markedly boosts graph-representation quality, it also adds non-trivial computational overhead. To mitigate the computational overhead of fractal dimension estimation, we derive a one-shot estimator by proving that the dimension discrepancy between original and renormalised graphs converges weakly to a centred Gaussian distribution. This theoretical insight enables a reduction in dimension computation cost by an order of magnitude, cutting overall training time by approximately 61%. The experiments show that FractalGCL not only delivers state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks but also outperforms traditional baselines on traffic networks by an average margin of about remarkably 7%.

  Selecting data points for model training is critical in machine learning. Effective selection methods can reduce the labeling effort, optimize on-device training for embedded systems with limited data storage, and enhance the model performance. This paper introduces a novel algorithm that uses Grad-CAM to make online decisions about retaining or discarding data points. Optimized for embedded devices, the algorithm computes a unique DRIP Score to quantify the importance of each data point. This enables dynamic decision-making on whether a data point should be stored for potential retraining or discarded without compromising model performance. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach can match or even surpass the accuracy of models trained on the entire dataset, all while achieving storage savings of up to 39\%. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that makes online decisions about data point retention without requiring access to the entire dataset.

  A tenet of reinforcement learning is that the agent always observes rewards. However, this is not true in many realistic settings, e.g., a human observer may not always be available to provide rewards, sensors may be limited or malfunctioning, or rewards may be inaccessible during deployment. Monitored Markov decision processes (Mon-MDPs) have recently been proposed to model such settings. However, existing Mon-MDP algorithms have several limitations: they do not fully exploit the problem structure, cannot leverage a known monitor, lack worst-case guarantees for 'unsolvable' Mon-MDPs without specific initialization, and offer only asymptotic convergence proofs. This paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce a model-based algorithm for Mon-MDPs that addresses these shortcomings. The algorithm employs two instances of model-based interval estimation: one to ensure that observable rewards are reliably captured, and another to learn the minimax-optimal policy. Second, we empirically demonstrate the advantages. We show faster convergence than prior algorithms in over four dozen benchmarks, and even more dramatic improvement when the monitoring process is known. Third, we present the first finite-sample bound on performance. We show convergence to a minimax-optimal policy even when some rewards are never observable.

  Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) underpins real-time monitoring in cloud services and web systems, allowing rapid identification of anomalies to prevent costly failures. Most TSAD methods driven by forecasting models tend to overfit by emphasizing minor fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that effective TSAD should focus on modeling "normal" behavior through smooth local patterns. To achieve this, we reformulate time series modeling as approximating the series with smooth univariate functions. The local smoothness of each univariate function ensures that the fitted time series remains resilient against local disturbances. However, a direct KAN implementation proves susceptible to these disturbances due to the inherently localized characteristics of B-spline functions. We thus propose KAN-AD, replacing B-splines with truncated Fourier expansions and introducing a novel lightweight learning mechanism that emphasizes global patterns while staying robust to local disturbances. On four popular TSAD benchmarks, KAN-AD achieves an average 15% improvement in detection accuracy (with peaks exceeding 27%) over state-of-the-art baselines. Remarkably, it requires fewer than 1,000 trainable parameters, resulting in a 50% faster inference speed compared to the original KAN, demonstrating the approach's efficiency and practical viability.

  MLLM agents demonstrate potential for complex embodied tasks by retrieving multimodal task-relevant trajectory data. However, current retrieval methods primarily focus on surface-level similarities of textual or visual cues in trajectories, neglecting their effectiveness for the specific task at hand. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, MLLM As ReTriever (MART), which enhances the performance of embodied agents by utilizing interaction data to fine-tune an MLLM retriever based on preference learning, such that the retriever fully considers the effectiveness of trajectories and prioritizes them for unseen tasks. We also introduce Trajectory Abstraction, a mechanism that leverages MLLMs' summarization capabilities to represent trajectories with fewer tokens while preserving key information, enabling agents to better comprehend milestones in the trajectory. Experimental results across various environments demonstrate our method significantly improves task success rates in unseen scenes compared to baseline methods. This work presents a new paradigm for multimodal retrieval in embodied agents, by fine-tuning a general-purpose MLLM as the retriever to assess trajectory effectiveness. All the code for benchmark tasks, simulator modifications, and the MLLM retriever is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) enables large-scale distributed training of machine learning models, while still allowing individual nodes to maintain data locally. However, executing FL at scale comes with inherent practical challenges: 1) heterogeneity of the local node data distributions, 2) heterogeneity of node computational speeds (asynchrony), but also 3) constraints in the amount of communication between the clients and the server. In this work, we present the first variant of the classic federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm which, at the same time, supports data heterogeneity, partial client asynchrony, and communication compression. Our algorithm comes with a novel, rigorous analysis showing that, in spite of these system relaxations, it can provide similar convergence to FedAvg in interesting parameter regimes. Experimental results in the rigorous LEAF benchmark on setups of up to 300 nodes show that our algorithm ensures fast convergence for standard federated tasks, improving upon prior quantized and asynchronous approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Driving simulation plays a crucial role in developing reliable driving agents by providing controlled, evaluative environments. To enable meaningful assessments, a high-quality driving simulator must satisfy several key requirements: multi-modal sensing capabilities (e.g., camera and LiDAR) with realistic scene rendering to minimize observational discrepancies; closed-loop evaluation to support free-form trajectory behaviors; highly diverse traffic scenarios for thorough evaluation; multi-agent cooperation to capture interaction dynamics; and high computational efficiency to ensure affordability and scalability. However, existing simulators and benchmarks fail to comprehensively meet these fundamental criteria. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces RealEngine, a novel driving simulation framework that holistically integrates 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis techniques to achieve realistic and flexible closed-loop simulation in the driving context. By leveraging real-world multi-modal sensor data, RealEngine reconstructs background scenes and foreground traffic participants separately, allowing for highly diverse and realistic traffic scenarios through flexible scene composition. This synergistic fusion of scene reconstruction and view synthesis enables photorealistic rendering across multiple sensor modalities, ensuring both perceptual fidelity and geometric accuracy. Building upon this environment, RealEngine supports three essential driving simulation categories: non-reactive simulation, safety testing, and multi-agent interaction, collectively forming a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the real-world performance of driving agents.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance in visual question answering. However, they often suffer from hallucinations. In this work, hallucinations are categorized into two main types: initial hallucinations and snowball hallucinations. We argue that adequate contextual information can be extracted directly from the token interaction process. Inspired by causal inference in the decoding strategy, we propose to leverage causal masks to establish information propagation between multimodal tokens. The hypothesis is that insufficient interaction between those tokens may lead the model to rely on outlier tokens, overlooking dense and rich contextual cues. Therefore, we propose to intervene in the propagation process by tackling outlier tokens to enhance in-context inference. With this goal, we present FarSight, a versatile plug-and-play decoding strategy to reduce attention interference from outlier tokens merely by optimizing the causal mask. The heart of our method is effective token propagation. We design an attention register structure within the upper triangular matrix of the causal mask, dynamically allocating attention to capture attention diverted to outlier tokens. Moreover, a positional awareness encoding method with a diminishing masking rate is proposed, allowing the model to attend to further preceding tokens, especially for video sequence tasks. With extensive experiments, FarSight demonstrates significant hallucination-mitigating performance across different MLLMs on both image and video benchmarks, proving its effectiveness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Maintaining robust 3D perception under dynamic and unpredictable test-time conditions remains a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often fail in high-variance tasks like 3D object detection due to unstable optimization and sharp minima. While recent model merging strategies based on linear mode connectivity (LMC) offer improved stability by interpolating between fine-tuned checkpoints, they are computationally expensive, requiring repeated checkpoint access and multiple forward passes. In this paper, we introduce CodeMerge, a lightweight and scalable model merging framework that bypasses these limitations by operating in a compact latent space. Instead of loading full models, CodeMerge represents each checkpoint with a low-dimensional fingerprint derived from the source model's penultimate features and constructs a key-value codebook. We compute merging coefficients using ridge leverage scores on these fingerprints, enabling efficient model composition without compromising adaptation quality. Our method achieves strong performance across challenging benchmarks, improving end-to-end 3D detection 14.9% NDS on nuScenes-C and LiDAR-based detection by over 7.6% mAP on nuScenes-to-KITTI, while benefiting downstream tasks such as online mapping, motion prediction and planning even without training. Code and pretrained models are released in the supplementary material.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time adaptation aims to adapt to realistic environments in an online manner by learning during test time. Entropy minimization has emerged as a principal strategy for test-time adaptation due to its efficiency and adaptability. Nevertheless, it remains underexplored in continual test-time adaptation, where stability is more important. We observe that the entropy minimization method often suffers from model collapse, where the model converges to predicting a single class for all images due to a trivial solution. We propose ranked entropy minimization to mitigate the stability problem of the entropy minimization method and extend its applicability to continuous scenarios. Our approach explicitly structures the prediction difficulty through a progressive masking strategy. Specifically, it gradually aligns the model's probability distributions across different levels of prediction difficulty while preserving the rank order of entropy. The proposed method is extensively evaluated across various benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness through empirical results. Our code is available atthis https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Local alignment between medical images and text is essential for accurate diagnosis, though it remains challenging due to the absence of natural local pairings and the limitations of rigid region recognition methods. Traditional approaches rely on hard boundaries, which introduce uncertainty, whereas medical imaging demands flexible soft region recognition to handle irregular structures. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Progressive Local Alignment Network (PLAN), which designs a novel contrastive learning-based approach for local alignment to establish meaningful word-pixel relationships and introduces a progressive learning strategy to iteratively refine these relationships, enhancing alignment precision and robustness. By combining these techniques, PLAN effectively improves soft region recognition while suppressing noise interference. Extensive experiments on multiple medical datasets demonstrate that PLAN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in phrase grounding, image-text retrieval, object detection, and zero-shot classification, setting a new benchmark for medical image-text alignment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While an image is worth more than a thousand words, only a few provide crucial information for a given task and thus should be focused on. In light of this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with 9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers, which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5 when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when prompts are only available during inference.

  Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced in visual tasks, yet their spatial understanding remains limited to single images, leaving them ill-suited for robotics and other real-world applications that require multi-frame reasoning. In this paper, we propose a framework to equip MLLMs with robust multi-frame spatial understanding by integrating depth perception, visual correspondence, and dynamic perception. Central to our approach is the MultiSPA dataset, a novel, large-scale collection of more than 27 million samples spanning diverse 3D and 4D scenes. Alongside MultiSPA, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark that tests a wide spectrum of spatial tasks under uniform metrics. Our resulting model, Multi-SpatialMLLM, achieves significant gains over baselines and proprietary systems, demonstrating scalable, generalizable multi-frame reasoning. We further observe multi-task benefits and early indications of emergent capabilities in challenging scenarios, and showcase how our model can serve as a multi-frame reward annotator for robotics.

  Existing medical VQA benchmarks mostly focus on single-image analysis, yet clinicians almost always compare a series of images before reaching a diagnosis. To better approximate this workflow, we introduce MedFrameQA -- the first benchmark that explicitly evaluates multi-image reasoning in medical VQA. To build MedFrameQA both at scale and in high-quality, we develop 1) an automated pipeline that extracts temporally coherent frames from medical videos and constructs VQA items whose content evolves logically across images, and 2) a multiple-stage filtering strategy, including model-based and manual review, to preserve data clarity, difficulty, and medical relevance. The resulting dataset comprises 2,851 VQA pairs (gathered from 9,237 high-quality frames in 3,420 videos), covering nine human body systems and 43 organs; every question is accompanied by two to five images. We comprehensively benchmark ten advanced Multimodal LLMs -- both proprietary and open source, with and without explicit reasoning modules -- on MedFrameQA. The evaluation challengingly reveals that all models perform poorly, with most accuracies below 50%, and accuracy fluctuates as the number of images per question increases. Error analysis further shows that models frequently ignore salient findings, mis-aggregate evidence across images, and propagate early mistakes through their reasoning chains; results also vary substantially across body systems, organs, and modalities. We hope this work can catalyze research on clinically grounded, multi-image reasoning and accelerate progress toward more capable diagnostic AI systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating image captions requires cohesive assessment of both visual semantics and language pragmatics, which is often not entirely captured by most metrics. We introduce Redemption Score, a novel hybrid framework that ranks image captions by triangulating three complementary signals: (1) Mutual Information Divergence (MID) for global image-text distributional alignment, (2) DINO-based perceptual similarity of cycle-generated images for visual grounding, and (3) BERTScore for contextual text similarity against human references. A calibrated fusion of these signals allows Redemption Score to offer a more holistic assessment. On the Flickr8k benchmark, Redemption Score achieves a Kendall-$\tau$ of 56.43, outperforming twelve prior methods and demonstrating superior correlation with human judgments without requiring task-specific training. Our framework provides a more robust and nuanced evaluation by effectively redeeming image semantics and linguistic interpretability indicated by strong transfer of knowledge in the Conceptual Captions and MS COCO datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to hallucination, often generating content misaligned with visual inputs. While recent approaches advance multi-modal Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate hallucination, they typically rely on predefined or randomly edited negative samples that fail to reflect actual model errors, limiting training efficacy. In this work, we propose an Online Vision-language Preference Learning (OViP) framework that dynamically constructs contrastive training data based on the model's own hallucinated outputs. By identifying semantic differences between sampled response pairs and synthesizing negative images using a diffusion model, OViP generates more relevant supervision signals in real time. This failure-driven training enables adaptive alignment of both textual and visual preferences. Moreover, we refine existing evaluation protocols to better capture the trade-off between hallucination suppression and expressiveness. Experiments on hallucination and general benchmarks demonstrate that OViP effectively reduces hallucinations while preserving core multi-modal capabilities.

  Recent advancements in Video Question Answering (VideoQA) have introduced LLM-based agents, modular frameworks, and procedural solutions, yielding promising results. These systems use dynamic agents and memory-based mechanisms to break down complex tasks and refine answers. However, significant improvements remain in tracking objects for grounding over time and decision-making based on reasoning to better align object references with language model outputs, as newer models get better at both tasks. This work presents an LLM-brained agent for zero-shot Video Question Answering (VideoQA) that combines a Chain-of-Thought framework with grounding reasoning alongside YOLO-World to enhance object tracking and alignment. This approach establishes a new state-of-the-art in VideoQA and Video Understanding, showing enhanced performance on NExT-QA, iVQA, and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. Our framework also enables cross-checking of grounding timeframes, improving accuracy and providing valuable support for verification and increased output reliability across multiple video domains.

  High-resolution (HR) image perception remains a key challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper shifts away from prior dedicated heuristic approaches and revisits the most fundamental idea to HR perception by enhancing the long-context capability of MLLMs, driven by recent advances in long-context techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general LLMs. Towards this end, this paper presents the first study exploring the use of RAG to address HR perception challenges. Specifically, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Perception (RAP), a training-free framework that retrieves and fuses relevant image crops while preserving spatial context using the proposed Spatial-Awareness Layout. To accommodate different tasks, the proposed Retrieved-Exploration Search (RE-Search) dynamically selects the optimal number of crops based on model confidence and retrieval scores. Experimental results on HR benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of RAP, with LLaVA-v1.5-13B achieving a 43% improvement on $V^*$ Bench and 19% on HR-Bench.

  End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) demands effective processing of multi-view sensory data and robust handling of diverse and complex driving scenarios, particularly rare maneuvers such as aggressive turns. Recent success of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates that specialization of parameters enables strong scalability. In this work, we propose DriveMoE, a novel MoE-based E2E-AD framework, with a Scene-Specialized Vision MoE and a Skill-Specialized Action MoE. DriveMoE is built upon our $\pi_0$ Vision-Language-Action (VLA) baseline (originally from the embodied AI field), called Drive-$\pi_0$. Specifically, we add Vision MoE to Drive-$\pi_0$ by training a router to select relevant cameras according to the driving context dynamically. This design mirrors human driving cognition, where drivers selectively attend to crucial visual cues rather than exhaustively processing all visual information. In addition, we add Action MoE by training another router to activate specialized expert modules for different driving behaviors. Through explicit behavioral specialization, DriveMoE is able to handle diverse scenarios without suffering from modes averaging like existing models. In Bench2Drive closed-loop evaluation experiments, DriveMoE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining vision and action MoE in autonomous driving tasks. We will release our code and models of DriveMoE and Drive-$\pi_0$.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and segmentation are crucial for deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery. While prior research has primarily focused on unimodal image data, real-world applications are inherently multimodal, requiring the integration of multiple modalities for improved OOD detection. A key challenge is the lack of supervision signals from unknown data, leading to overconfident predictions on OOD samples. To address this challenge, we propose Feature Mixing, an extremely simple and fast method for multimodal outlier synthesis with theoretical support, which can be further optimized to help the model better distinguish between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data. Feature Mixing is modality-agnostic and applicable to various modality combinations. Additionally, we introduce CARLA-OOD, a novel multimodal dataset for OOD segmentation, featuring synthetic OOD objects across diverse scenes and weather conditions. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, CARLA-OOD datasets, and the MultiOOD benchmark demonstrate that Feature Mixing achieves state-of-the-art performance with a $10 \times$ to $370 \times$ speedup.

  Continual post-training adapts a single text-to-image diffusion model to learn new tasks without incurring the cost of separate models, but naive post-training causes forgetting of pretrained knowledge and undermines zero-shot compositionality. We observe that the absence of a standardized evaluation protocol hampers related research for continual post-training. To address this, we introduce T2I-ConBench, a unified benchmark for continual post-training of text-to-image models. T2I-ConBench focuses on two practical scenarios, item customization and domain enhancement, and analyzes four dimensions: (1) retention of generality, (2) target-task performance, (3) catastrophic forgetting, and (4) cross-task generalization. It combines automated metrics, human-preference modeling, and vision-language QA for comprehensive assessment. We benchmark ten representative methods across three realistic task sequences and find that no approach excels on all fronts. Even joint "oracle" training does not succeed for every task, and cross-task generalization remains unsolved. We release all datasets, code, and evaluation tools to accelerate research in continual post-training for text-to-image models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current self-supervised algorithms commonly rely on transformations such as data augmentation and masking to learn visual representations. This is achieved by enforcing invariance or equivariance with respect to these transformations after encoding two views of an image. This dominant two-view paradigm often limits the flexibility of learned representations for downstream adaptation by creating performance trade-offs between high-level invariance-demanding tasks such as image classification and more fine-grained equivariance-related tasks. In this work, we proposes \emph{seq-JEPA}, a world modeling framework that introduces architectural inductive biases into joint-embedding predictive architectures to resolve this trade-off. Without relying on dual equivariance predictors or loss terms, seq-JEPA simultaneously learns two architecturally segregated representations: one equivariant to specified transformations and another invariant to them. To do so, our model processes short sequences of different views (observations) of inputs. Each encoded view is concatenated with an embedding of the relative transformation (action) that produces the next observation in the sequence. These view-action pairs are passed through a transformer encoder that outputs an aggregate representation. A predictor head then conditions this aggregate representation on the upcoming action to predict the representation of the next observation. Empirically, seq-JEPA demonstrates strong performance on both equivariant and invariant benchmarks without sacrificing one for the other. Furthermore, it excels at tasks that inherently require aggregating a sequence of observations, such as path integration across actions and predictive learning across eye movements.

  In this work, we aim to incentivize the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) and develop an effective approach that mitigates the sparse reward and advantage vanishing issues during RL. To this end, we propose Share-GRPO, a novel RL approach that tackle these issues by exploring and sharing diverse reasoning trajectories over expanded question space. Specifically, Share-GRPO first expands the question space for a given question via data transformation techniques, and then encourages MLLM to effectively explore diverse reasoning trajectories over the expanded question space and shares the discovered reasoning trajectories across the expanded questions during RL. In addition, Share-GRPO also shares reward information during advantage computation, which estimates solution advantages hierarchically across and within question variants, allowing more accurate estimation of relative advantages and improving the stability of policy training. Extensive evaluations over six widely-used reasoning benchmarks showcase the superior performance of our method. Code will be available atthis https URL.

  Image classification benchmark datasets such as CIFAR, MNIST, and ImageNet serve as critical tools for model evaluation. However, despite the cleaning efforts, these datasets still suffer from pervasive noisy labels and often contain missing labels due to the co-existing image pattern where multiple classes appear in an image sample. This results in misleading model comparisons and unfair evaluations. Existing label cleaning methods focus primarily on noisy labels, but the issue of missing labels remains largely overlooked. Motivated by these challenges, we present a comprehensive framework named REVEAL, integrating state-of-the-art pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., LLaVA, BLIP, Janus, Qwen) with advanced machine/human label curation methods (e.g., Docta, Cleanlab, MTurk), to systematically address both noisy labels and missing label detection in widely-used image classification test sets. REVEAL detects potential noisy labels and omissions, aggregates predictions from various methods, and refines label accuracy through confidence-informed predictions and consensus-based filtering. Additionally, we provide a thorough analysis of state-of-the-art vision-language models and pre-trained image classifiers, highlighting their strengths and limitations within the context of dataset renovation by revealing 10 observations. Our method effectively reveals missing labels from public datasets and provides soft-labeled results with likelihoods. Through human verifications, REVEAL significantly improves the quality of 6 benchmark test sets, highly aligning to human judgments and enabling more accurate and meaningful comparisons in image classification.

However, this reasoning process has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its effectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel framework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual reasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable VLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby enhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks. Our 7B model, \model, achieves 84\% on V* bench, 74\% on TallyQA-Complex, and 84\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy achieved by any open-source model to date. These results highlight the importance of pixel-space reasoning and the effectiveness of our framework.

  Large foundation models face challenges in acquiring transferable, structured thinking abilities, especially when supervised with rigid templates or crowd-annotated instruction datasets. Unlike prior approaches, we focus on a thinking-centric data synthesis paradigm that enables models to evolve through self-generated, cognitively guided data. We propose MindGYM, a structured and scalable framework for question synthesis, composed of: (1) Cognitive Thinking Process Injection, which infuses high-level reasoning objectives to shape the model's synthesis behavior; (2) Seed Single-Hop Question Synthesis, generating atomic questions from diverse semantic types to encourage broader thinking; and (3) Challenging Multi-Hop QA Synthesis, composing more complex multi-hop questions based on QA seeds for deeper reasoning. Detailed analysis shows that synthetic data generated by our method achieves 16.7% higher average quality and 67.91% lower quality variance compared to baseline sources, highlighting that both high-quality and self-contained data are essential for effective, thinking-oriented fine-tuning. MindGYM improves performance on six reasoning benchmarks, achieving gains of up to 16% on MathVision using only 400 data samples, and generalizable improvements across different model sizes and architectures. MindGYM underscores the viability of self-challenging mechanisms in refining large model capabilities while minimizing human intervention and resource demands. Code and data are released to promote data-centric research into self-evolving foundation models driven by their internal reasoning capabilities.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive success in question-answering tasks, yet their capabilities for spatial understanding are less explored. This work investigates a critical question: do existing MLLMs possess 3D spatial perception and understanding abilities? Concretely, we make the following contributions in this paper: (i) we introduce VGBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess MLLMs for visual geometry perception, e.g., camera pose and motion estimation; (ii) we propose SpatialScore, the most comprehensive and diverse multimodal spatial understanding benchmark to date, integrating VGBench with relevant data from the other 11 existing datasets. This benchmark comprises 28K samples across various spatial understanding tasks, modalities, and QA formats, along with a carefully curated challenging subset, SpatialScore-Hard; (iii) we develop SpatialAgent, a novel multi-agent system incorporating 9 specialized tools for spatial understanding, supporting both Plan-Execute and ReAct reasoning paradigms; (iv) we conduct extensive evaluations to reveal persistent challenges in spatial reasoning while demonstrating the effectiveness of SpatialAgent. We believe SpatialScore will offer valuable insights and serve as a rigorous benchmark for the next evolution of MLLMs.

  While recent text-to-image (T2I) models show impressive capabilities in synthesizing images from brief descriptions, their performance significantly degrades when confronted with long, detail-intensive prompts required in professional applications. We present DetailMaster, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate T2I models' systematical abilities to handle extended textual inputs that contain complex compositional requirements. Our benchmark introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: Character Attributes, Structured Character Locations, Multi-Dimensional Scene Attributes, and Explicit Spatial/Interactive Relationships. The benchmark comprises long and detail-rich prompts averaging 284.89 tokens, with high quality validated by expert annotators. Evaluation on 7 general-purpose and 5 long-prompt-optimized T2I models reveals critical performance limitations: state-of-the-art models achieve merely ~50% accuracy in key dimensions like attribute binding and spatial reasoning, while all models showing progressive performance degradation as prompt length increases. Our analysis highlights systemic failures in structural comprehension and detail overload handling, motivating future research into architectures with enhanced compositional reasoning. We open-source the dataset, data curation code, and evaluation tools to advance detail-rich T2I generation and enable broad applications that would otherwise be infeasible due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark.

  The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media has raised growing concerns, while research on video misinformation detection remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets. Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.

  While the safety risks of image-based large language models have been extensively studied, their video-based counterparts (Video LLMs) remain critically under-examined. To systematically study this problem, we introduce \textbf{VideoSafetyBench (VSB-77k) - the first large-scale, culturally diverse benchmark for Video LLM safety}, which compromises 77,646 video-query pairs and spans 19 principal risk categories across 10 language communities. \textit{We reveal that integrating video modality degrades safety performance by an average of 42.3\%, exposing systemic risks in multimodal attack exploitation.} To address this vulnerability, we propose \textbf{VideoSafety-R1}, a dual-stage framework achieving unprecedented safety gains through two innovations: (1) Alarm Token-Guided Safety Fine-Tuning (AT-SFT) injects learnable alarm tokens into visual and textual sequences, enabling explicit harm perception across modalities via multitask objectives. (2) Then, Safety-Guided GRPO enhances defensive reasoning through dynamic policy optimization with rule-based rewards derived from dual-modality verification. These components synergize to shift safety alignment from passive harm recognition to active reasoning. The resulting framework achieves a 65.1\% improvement on VSB-Eval-HH, and improves by 59.1\%, 44.3\%, and 15.0\% on the image safety datasets MMBench, VLGuard, and FigStep, respectively. \textit{Our codes are available in the supplementary materials.} \textcolor{red}{Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and videos, and reader discretion is recommended.}

Traditional approaches rely on isolated data streams, limiting their effectiveness in capturing the full context of a match. To address this, we introduce SoccerChat, a multimodal conversational AI framework that integrates visual and textual data for enhanced soccer video comprehension. Leveraging the extensive SoccerNet dataset, enriched with jersey color annotations and automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, SoccerChat is fine-tuned on a structured video instruction dataset to facilitate accurate game understanding, event classification, and referee decision making. We benchmark SoccerChat on action classification and referee decision-making tasks, demonstrating its performance in general soccer event comprehension while maintaining competitive accuracy in referee decision making.

  In recent years, the rapid development of deepfake technology has given rise to an emerging and serious threat to public security: diffusion model-based digital human generation. Unlike traditional face manipulation methods, such models can generate highly realistic videos with consistency through multimodal control signals. Their flexibility and covertness pose severe challenges to existing detection strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DigiFakeAV, the first large-scale multimodal digital human forgery dataset based on diffusion models. Employing five latest digital human generation methods (Sonic, Hallo, etc.) and voice cloning method, we systematically produce a dataset comprising 60,000 videos (8.4 million frames), covering multiple nationalities, skin tones, genders, and real-world scenarios, significantly enhancing data diversity and realism. User studies show that the confusion rate between forged and real videos reaches 68%, and existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection models exhibit large drops in AUC values on DigiFakeAV, highlighting the challenge of the dataset. To address this problem, we further propose DigiShield, a detection baseline based on spatiotemporal and cross-modal fusion. By jointly modeling the 3D spatiotemporal features of videos and the semantic-acoustic features of audio, DigiShield achieves SOTA performance on both the DigiFakeAV and DF-TIMIT datasets. Experiments show that this method effectively identifies covert artifacts through fine-grained analysis of the temporal evolution of facial features in synthetic videos.

  Long Video Temporal Grounding (LVTG) aims at identifying specific moments within lengthy videos based on user-provided text queries for effective content retrieval. The approach taken by existing methods of dividing video into clips and processing each clip via a full-scale expert encoder is challenging to scale due to prohibitive computational costs of processing a large number of clips in long videos. To address this issue, we introduce DeCafNet, an approach employing ``delegate-and-conquer'' strategy to achieve computation efficiency without sacrificing grounding performance. DeCafNet introduces a sidekick encoder that performs dense feature extraction over all video clips in a resource-efficient manner, while generating a saliency map to identify the most relevant clips for full processing by the expert encoder. To effectively leverage features from sidekick and expert encoders that exist at different temporal resolutions, we introduce DeCaf-Grounder, which unifies and refines them via query-aware temporal aggregation and multi-scale temporal refinement for accurate grounding. Experiments on two LTVG benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeCafNet reduces computation by up to 47\% while still outperforming existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art for LTVG in terms of both efficiency and performance.

  Recently, reasoning-based MLLMs have achieved a degree of success in generating long-form textual reasoning chains. However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on and revisiting of visual regions to achieve precise grounding of textual reasoning in visual evidence. We introduce \textbf{VLM-R$^3$} (\textbf{V}isual \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel with \textbf{R}egion \textbf{R}ecognition and \textbf{R}easoning), a framework that equips an MLLM with the ability to (i) decide \emph{when} additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine \emph{where} to ground within the image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved chain-of-thought. The core of our method is \textbf{Region-Conditioned Reinforcement Policy Optimization (R-GRPO)}, a training paradigm that rewards the model for selecting informative regions, formulating appropriate transformations (e.g.\ crop, zoom), and integrating the resulting visual context into subsequent reasoning steps. To bootstrap this policy, we compile a modest but carefully curated Visuo-Lingual Interleaved Rationale (VLIR) corpus that provides step-level supervision on region selection and textual justification. Extensive experiments on MathVista, ScienceQA, and other benchmarks show that VLM-R$^3$ sets a new state of the art in zero-shot and few-shot settings, with the largest gains appearing on questions demanding subtle spatial reasoning or fine-grained visual cue extraction.

  With video games now generating the highest revenues in the entertainment industry, optimizing game development workflows has become essential for the sector's sustained growth. Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer considerable potential to automate and enhance various aspects of game development, particularly Quality Assurance (QA), which remains one of the industry's most labor-intensive processes with limited automation options. To accurately evaluate the performance of VLMs in video game QA tasks and determine their effectiveness in handling real-world scenarios, there is a clear need for standardized benchmarks, as existing benchmarks are insufficient to address the specific requirements of this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce VideoGameQA-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers a wide array of game QA activities, including visual unit testing, visual regression testing, needle-in-a-haystack tasks, glitch detection, and bug report generation for both images and videos of various games.

  Road safety is a critical challenge, particularly for cyclists, who are among the most vulnerable road users. This study aims to enhance road safety by proposing a novel benchmark for bicycle occlusion level classification using advanced computer vision techniques. Utilizing a parts-based detection model, images are annotated and processed through a custom image detection pipeline. A novel method of bicycle occlusion level is proposed to objectively quantify the visibility and occlusion level of bicycle semantic parts. The findings indicate that the model robustly quantifies the visibility and occlusion level of bicycles, a significant improvement over the subjective methods used by the current state of the art. Widespread use of the proposed methodology will facilitate accurate performance reporting of cyclist detection algorithms for occluded cyclists, informing the development of more robust vulnerable road user detection methods for autonomous vehicles.

  As Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) become more capable, there is growing interest in evaluating their reasoning processes alongside their final outputs. However, most benchmarks remain focused on English, overlooking languages with rich linguistic and cultural contexts, such as Arabic. To address this gap, we introduce the Comprehensive Arabic Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark (ARB), the first benchmark designed to evaluate step-by-step reasoning in Arabic across both textual and visual modalities. ARB spans 11 diverse domains, including visual reasoning, document understanding, OCR, scientific analysis, and cultural interpretation. It comprises 1,356 multimodal samples paired with 5,119 human-curated reasoning steps and corresponding actions. We evaluated 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LMMs and found persistent challenges in coherence, faithfulness, and cultural grounding. ARB offers a structured framework for diagnosing multimodal reasoning in underrepresented languages and marks a critical step toward inclusive, transparent, and culturally aware AI systems. We release the benchmark, rubric, and evaluation suit to support future research and reproducibility. Code available at:this https URL

  The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has significantly enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and interpret diverse data modalities (e.g., image and video). However, as input complexity increases, particularly with long video sequences, the number of required tokens has grown significantly, leading to quadratically computational costs. This has made the efficient compression of video tokens in LMMs, while maintaining performance integrity, a pressing research challenge. In this paper, we introduce CrossLMM, decoupling long video sequences from LMMs via a dual cross-attention mechanism, which substantially reduces visual token quantity with minimal performance degradation. Specifically, we first implement a significant token reduction from pretrained visual encoders through a pooling methodology. Then, within LLM layers, we employ a visual-to-visual cross-attention mechanism, wherein the pooled visual tokens function as queries against the original visual token set. This module enables more efficient token utilization while retaining fine-grained informational fidelity. In addition, we introduce a text-to-visual cross-attention mechanism, for which the text tokens are enhanced through interaction with the original visual tokens, enriching the visual comprehension of the text tokens. Comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance across diverse video-based LMM benchmarks, despite utilizing substantially fewer computational resources.

  Recent advances have shown success in eliciting strong reasoning abilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome rewards. However, this paradigm typically lacks supervision over the thinking process leading to the finalthis http URLa result, the model may learn sub-optimal reasoning strategies, which can hinder its generalization ability. In light of this, we propose SophiaVL-R1, as an attempt to add reward signals for the thinking process in this paradigm. To achieve this, we first train a thinking reward model that evaluates the quality of the entire thinking process. Given that the thinking reward may be unreliable for certain samples due to reward hacking, we propose the Trust-GRPO method, which assigns a trustworthiness weight to the thinking reward during training. This weight is computed based on the thinking reward comparison of responses leading to correct answers versus incorrect answers, helping to mitigate the impact of potentially unreliable thinking rewards. Moreover, we design an annealing training strategy that gradually reduces the thinking reward over time, allowing the model to rely more on the accurate rule-based outcome reward in later training stages. Experiments show that our SophiaVL-R1 surpasses a series of reasoning MLLMs on various benchmarks (e.g., MathVisita, MMMU), demonstrating strong reasoning and generalization capabilities. Notably, our SophiaVL-R1-7B even outperforms LLaVA-OneVision-72B on most benchmarks, despite the latter having 10 times more parameters.

  Recent advancement in deep learning encouraged developing large automatic speech recognition (ASR) models that achieve promising results while ignoring computational and memory constraints. However, deploying such models on low resource devices is impractical despite of their favorable performance. Existing approaches (pruning, distillation, layer skip etc.) transform the large models into smaller ones at the cost of significant performance degradation or require prolonged training of smaller models for better performance. To address these issues, we introduce an efficacious two-step representation learning based approach capable of producing several small sized models from a single large model ensuring considerably better performance in limited number of epochs. Comprehensive experimentation on ASR benchmarks reveals the efficacy of our approach, achieving three-fold training speed-up and up to 12.54% word error rate improvement.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we propose Dimple, the first Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Large Language Model (DMLLM). We observe that training with a purely discrete diffusion approach leads to significant training instability, suboptimal performance, and severe length bias issues. To address these challenges, we design a novel training paradigm that combines an initial autoregressive phase with a subsequent diffusion phase. This approach yields the Dimple-7B model, trained on the same dataset and using a similar training pipeline as LLaVA-NEXT. Dimple-7B ultimately surpasses LLaVA-NEXT in performance by 3.9%, demonstrating that DMLLM can achieve performance comparable to that of autoregressive models. To improve inference efficiency, we propose a decoding strategy termed confident decoding, which dynamically adjusts the number of tokens generated at each step, significantly reducing the number of generation iterations. In autoregressive models, the number of forward iterations during generation equals the response length. With confident decoding, however, the number of iterations needed by Dimple is even only $\frac{\text{response length}}{3}$. We also re-implement the prefilling technique in autoregressive models and demonstrate that it does not significantly impact performance on most benchmark evaluations, while offering a speedup of 1.5x to 7x. Additionally, we explore Dimple's capability to precisely control its response using structure priors. These priors enable structured responses in a manner distinct from instruction-based or chain-of-thought prompting, and allow fine-grained control over response format and length, which is difficult to achieve in autoregressive models. Overall, this work validates the feasibility and advantages of DMLLM and enhances its inference efficiency and controllability. Code and models are available atthis https URL.

  Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) has drawn increasing attention for its capacity to generalize segmentation beyond predefined categories. However, existing methods typically predict segmentation masks with simple forward inference, lacking explicit reasoning and interpretability. This makes it challenging for OVS model to distinguish similar categories in open-world settings due to the lack of contextual understanding and discriminative visual cues. To address this limitation, we propose a step-by-step visual reasoning framework for open-vocabulary segmentation, named OpenSeg-R. The proposed OpenSeg-R leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to perform hierarchical visual reasoning before segmentation. Specifically, we generate both generic and image-specific reasoning for each image, forming structured triplets that explain the visual reason for objects in a coarse-to-fine manner. Based on these reasoning steps, we can compose detailed description prompts, and feed them to the segmentor to produce more accurate segmentation masks. To the best of our knowledge, OpenSeg-R is the first framework to introduce explicit step-by-step visual reasoning into OVS. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenSeg-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across five benchmark datasets. Moreover, it achieves consistent gains across all metrics on open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Qualitative results further highlight the effectiveness of our reasoning-guided framework in improving both segmentation precision and interpretability.

  Despite the remarkable generation quality of video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, their practical deployment is severely hindered by extensive computational requirements. This inefficiency stems from two key challenges: the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to token length and the multi-step nature of diffusion models. To address these limitations, we present Jenga, a novel inference pipeline that combines dynamic attention carving with progressive resolution generation. Our approach leverages two key insights: (1) early denoising steps do not require high-resolution latents, and (2) later steps do not require dense attention. Jenga introduces a block-wise attention mechanism that dynamically selects relevant token interactions using 3D space-filling curves, alongside a progressive resolution strategy that gradually increases latent resolution during generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Jenga achieves substantial speedups across multiple state-of-the-art video diffusion models while maintaining comparable generation quality (8.83$\times$ speedup with 0.01\% performance drop on VBench). As a plug-and-play solution, Jenga enables practical, high-quality video generation on modern hardware by reducing inference time from minutes to seconds -- without requiring model retraining.

  Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve a wide range of tasks requiring visual reasoning. In real-world scenarios, desirable properties for VLMs include fast inference and controllable generation (e.g., constraining outputs to adhere to a desired format). However, existing autoregressive (AR) VLMs like LLaVA struggle in these aspects. Discrete diffusion models (DMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling parallel decoding for faster inference and bidirectional context for controllable generation through text-infilling. While effective in language-only settings, DMs' potential for multimodal tasks is underexplored. We introduce LaViDa, a family of VLMs built on DMs. We build LaViDa by equipping DMs with a vision encoder and jointly fine-tune the combined parts for multimodal instruction following. To address challenges encountered, LaViDa incorporates novel techniques such as complementary masking for effective training, prefix KV cache for efficient inference, and timestep shifting for high-quality sampling. Experiments show that LaViDa achieves competitive or superior performance to AR VLMs on multi-modal benchmarks such as MMMU, while offering unique advantages of DMs, including flexible speed-quality tradeoff, controllability, and bidirectional reasoning. On COCO captioning, LaViDa surpasses Open-LLaVa-Next-8B by +4.1 CIDEr with 1.92x speedup. On bidirectional tasks, it achieves +59% improvement on Constrained Poem Completion. These results demonstrate LaViDa as a strong alternative to AR VLMs. Code and models will be released in the camera-ready version.

  Significant progress has been made in video restoration under rainy conditions over the past decade, largely propelled by advancements in deep learning. Nevertheless, existing methods that depend on paired data struggle to generalize effectively to real-world scenarios, primarily due to the disparity between synthetic and authentic rain effects. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-branch spatio-temporal state-space model to enhance rain streak removal in video sequences. Specifically, we design spatial and temporal state-space model layers to extract spatial features and incorporate temporal dependencies across frames, respectively. To improve multi-frame feature fusion, we derive a dynamic stacking filter, which adaptively approximates statistical filters for superior pixel-wise feature refinement. Moreover, we develop a median stacking loss to enable semi-supervised learning by generating pseudo-clean patches based on the sparsity prior of rain. To further explore the capacity of deraining models in supporting other vision-based tasks in rainy environments, we introduce a novel real-world benchmark focused on object detection and tracking in rainy conditions. Our method is extensively evaluated across multiple benchmarks containing numerous synthetic and real-world rainy videos, consistently demonstrating its superiority in quantitative metrics, visual quality, efficiency, and its utility for downstream tasks.

  Earth observation foundation models have shown strong generalization across multiple Earth observation tasks, but their robustness under real-world perturbations remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce REOBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the robustness of Earth observation foundation models across six tasks and twelve types of image corruptions, including both appearance-based and geometric perturbations. To ensure realistic and fine-grained evaluation, our benchmark focuses on high-resolution optical remote sensing images, which are widely used in critical applications such as urban planning and disaster response. We conduct a systematic evaluation of a broad range of models trained using masked image modeling, contrastive learning, and vision-language pre-training paradigms. Our results reveal that (1) existing Earth observation foundation models experience significant performance degradation when exposed to input corruptions. (2) The severity of degradation varies across tasks, model architectures, backbone sizes, and types of corruption, with performance drop varying from less than 1% to over 20%. (3) Vision-language models show enhanced robustness, particularly in multimodal tasks. REOBench underscores the vulnerability of current Earth observation foundation models to real-world corruptions and provides actionable insights for developing more robust and reliable models.

  The rapid advancement of native multi-modal models and omni-models, exemplified by GPT-4o, Gemini, and o3, with their capability to process and generate content across modalities such as text and images, marks a significant milestone in the evolution of intelligence. Systematic evaluation of their multi-modal output capabilities in visual thinking processes (also known as multi-modal chain of thought, M-CoT) becomes critically important. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating multi-modal models primarily focus on assessing multi-modal inputs and text-only reasoning while neglecting the importance of reasoning through multi-modal outputs. In this paper, we present a benchmark, dubbed RBench-V, designed to assess models' vision-indispensable reasoning abilities. To construct RBench-V, we carefully hand-pick 803 questions covering math, physics, counting, and games. Unlike previous benchmarks that typically specify certain input modalities, RBench-V presents problems centered on multi-modal outputs, which require image manipulation such as generating novel images and constructing auxiliary lines to support the reasoning process. We evaluate numerous open- and closed-source models on RBench-V, including o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, etc. Even the best-performing model, o3, achieves only 25.8% accuracy on RBench-V, far below the human score of 82.3%, highlighting that current models struggle to leverage multi-modal reasoning.

  Recent advances in multi-modal generative models have enabled significant progress in instruction-based image editing. However, while these models produce visually plausible outputs, their capacity for knowledge-based reasoning editing tasks remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce KRIS-Bench (Knowledge-based Reasoning in Image-editing Systems Benchmark), a diagnostic benchmark designed to assess models through a cognitively informed lens. Drawing from educational theory, KRIS-Bench categorizes editing tasks across three foundational knowledge types: Factual, Conceptual, and Procedural. Based on this taxonomy, we design 22 representative tasks spanning 7 reasoning dimensions and release 1,267 high-quality annotated editing instances. To support fine-grained evaluation, we propose a comprehensive protocol that incorporates a novel Knowledge Plausibility metric, enhanced by knowledge hints and calibrated through human studies. Empirical results on 10 state-of-the-art models reveal significant gaps in reasoning performance, highlighting the need for knowledge-centric benchmarks to advance the development of intelligent image editing systems.

  _Asrar Alruwayqi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel framework for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction that integrates three key components: an explicit tri-plane deformation field, a view-conditioned canonical radiance field with spherical harmonics (SH) attention, and a temporally-aware latent diffusion prior. Our method encodes 4D scenes using three orthogonal 2D feature planes that evolve over time, enabling efficient and compact spatiotemporal representation. These features are explicitly warped into a canonical space via a deformation offset field, eliminating the need for MLP-based motion modeling.In canonical space, we replace traditional MLP decoders with a structured SH-based rendering head that synthesizes view-dependent color via attention over learned frequency bands improving both interpretability and rendering efficiency. To further enhance fidelity and temporal consistency, we introduce a transformer-guided latent diffusion module that refines the tri-plane and deformation features in a compressed latent space. This generative module denoises scene representations under ambiguous or out-of-distribution (OOD) motion, improving generalization.Our model is trained in two stages: the diffusion module is first pre-trained independently, and then fine-tuned jointly with the full pipeline using a combination of image reconstruction, diffusion denoising, and temporal consistency losses. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on synthetic benchmarks, surpassing recent methods such as HexPlane and 4D Gaussian Splatting in visual quality, temporal coherence, and robustness to sparse-view dynamic inputs.

  While humans effortlessly draw visual objects and shapes by adaptively allocating attention based on their complexity, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain constrained by rigid token representations. Bridging this gap, we propose ALTo, an adaptive length tokenizer for autoregressive mask generation. To achieve this, a novel token length predictor is designed, along with a length regularization term and a differentiable token chunking strategy. We further build ALToLLM that seamlessly integrates ALTo into MLLM. Preferences on the trade-offs between mask quality and efficiency is implemented by group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Experiments demonstrate that ALToLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance with adaptive token cost on popular segmentation benchmarks. Code and models are released atthis https URL.

  Bounding box supervision has gained considerable attention in weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation. While this approach alleviates the need for extensive point-level annotations, obtaining accurate bounding boxes in practical applications remains challenging. To this end, we explore the inaccurate bounding box, named sketchy bounding box, which is imitated through perturbing ground truth bounding box by adding scaling, translation, and rotation. In this paper, we propose Sketchy-3DIS, a novel weakly 3D instance segmentation framework, which jointly learns pseudo labeler and segmentator to improve the performance under the sketchy bounding-box supervisions. Specifically, we first propose an adaptive box-to-point pseudo labeler that adaptively learns to assign points located in the overlapped parts between two sketchy bounding boxes to the correct instance, resulting in compact and pure pseudo instance labels. Then, we present a coarse-to-fine instance segmentator that first predicts coarse instances from the entire point cloud and then learns fine instances based on the region of coarse instances. Finally, by using the pseudo instance labels to supervise the instance segmentator, we can gradually generate high-quality instances through joint training. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the ScanNetV2 and S3DIS benchmarks, and even outperforms several fully supervised methods using sketchy bounding boxes.

  Due to the challenges of processing temporal information, most trackers depend solely on visual discriminability and overlook the unique temporal coherence of video data. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and plug-and-play motion prompt tracking method. It can be easily integrated into existing vision-based trackers to build a joint tracking framework leveraging both motion and vision cues, thereby achieving robust tracking through efficient prompt learning. A motion encoder with three different positional encodings is proposed to encode the long-term motion trajectory into the visual embedding space, while a fusion decoder and an adaptive weight mechanism are designed to dynamically fuse visual and motion features. We integrate our motion module into three different trackers with five models in total. Experiments on seven challenging tracking benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed motion module significantly improves the robustness of vision-based trackers, with minimal training costs and negligible speed sacrifice.

  Training large language models (LLMs) as interactive agents for controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents a unique challenge to optimize long-horizon action sequences with multimodal feedback from complex environments. While recent works have advanced multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning and tool-using capabilities in LLMs, their application to GUI-based agents remains relatively underexplored due to the difficulty of sparse rewards, delayed feedback, and high rollout costs. In this paper, we investigate end-to-end policy optimization for vision-language-based GUI agents with the aim of improving performance on complex, long-horizon computer tasks. We propose Agentic Replay Policy Optimization (ARPO), an end-to-end RL approach that augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a replay buffer to reuse the successful experience across training iterations. To further stabilize the training process, we propose a task selection strategy that filters tasks based on baseline agent performance, allowing the agent to focus on learning from informative interactions. Additionally, we compare ARPO with offline preference optimization approaches, highlighting the advantages of policy-based methods in GUI environments. Experiments on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that ARPO achieves competitive results, establishing a new performance baseline for LLM-based GUI agents trained via reinforcement learning. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of reinforcement learning for training multi-turn, vision-language GUI agents capable of managing complex real-world UI interactions.

  Ultra-high-definition (UHD) image restoration aims to specifically solve the problem of quality degradation in ultra-high-resolution images. Recent advancements in this field are predominantly driven by deep learning-based innovations, including enhancements in dataset construction, network architecture, sampling strategies, prior knowledge integration, and loss functions. In this paper, we systematically review recent progress in UHD image restoration, covering various aspects ranging from dataset construction to algorithm design. This serves as a valuable resource for understanding state-of-the-art developments in the field. We begin by summarizing degradation models for various image restoration subproblems, such as super-resolution, low-light enhancement, deblurring, dehazing, deraining, and desnowing, and emphasizing the unique challenges of their application to UHD image restoration. We then highlight existing UHD benchmark datasets and organize the literature according to degradation types and dataset construction methods. Following this, we showcase major milestones in deep learning-driven UHD image restoration, reviewing the progression of restoration tasks, technological developments, and evaluations of existing methods. We further propose a classification framework based on network architectures and sampling strategies, helping to clearly organize existing methods. Finally, we share insights into the current research landscape and propose directions for further advancements. A related repository is available atthis https URL.

  _Yuang Ai, Huaibo Huang, Tao Wu, Qihang Fan, Ran He_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based models have made remarkable progress in image restoration (IR) tasks. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention in Transformer hinders its applicability to high-resolution images. Existing methods mitigate this issue with sparse or window-based attention, yet inherently limit global context modeling. Linear attention, a variant of softmax attention, demonstrates promise in global context modeling while maintaining linear complexity, offering a potential solution to the above challenge. Despite its efficiency benefits, vanilla linear attention suffers from a significant performance drop in IR, largely due to the low-rank nature of its attention map. To counter this, we propose Rank Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA), a simple yet effective method that enriches feature representations by integrating a lightweight depthwise convolution. Building upon RELA, we propose an efficient and effective image restoration Transformer, named LAformer. LAformer achieves effective global perception by integrating linear attention and channel attention, while also enhancing local fitting capabilities through a convolutional gated feed-forward network. Notably, LAformer eliminates hardware-inefficient operations such as softmax and window shifting, enabling efficient processing of high-resolution images. Extensive experiments across 7 IR tasks and 21 benchmarks demonstrate that LAformer outperforms SOTA methods and offers significant computational advantages.

  Recent advances in Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o1) have showcased impressive reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning. However, extending these capabilities to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is hampered by the prohibitive costs of retraining and the scarcity of high-quality, verifiable multimodal reasoning datasets. This paper introduces FRANK Model, a training-FRee ANd r1-liKe MLLM that imbues off-the-shelf MLLMs with reasoning and reflection abilities, without any gradient updates or extra supervision. Our key insight is to decouple perception and reasoning across MLLM decoder layers. Specifically, we observe that compared to the deeper decoder layers, the shallow decoder layers allocate more attention to visual tokens, while the deeper decoder layers concentrate on textual semantics. This observation motivates a hierarchical weight merging approach that combines a visual-pretrained MLLM with a reasoning-specialized LLM. To this end, we propose a layer-wise, Taylor-derived closed-form fusion mechanism that integrates reasoning capacity into deep decoder layers while preserving visual grounding in shallow decoder layers. Extensive experiments on challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the MMMU benchmark, our model FRANK-38B achieves an accuracy of 69.2, outperforming the strongest baseline InternVL2.5-38B by +5.3, and even surpasses the proprietary GPT-4o model.

  Perceiving pedestrians in highly crowded urban environments is a difficult long-tail problem for learning-based autonomous perception. Speeding up 3D ground truth generation for such challenging scenes is performance-critical yet very challenging. The difficulties include the sparsity of the captured pedestrian point cloud and a lack of suitable benchmarks for a specific system design study. To tackle the challenges, we first collect a new multi-view LiDAR-camera 3D multiple-object-tracking benchmark of highly crowded pedestrians for in-depth analysis. We then build an offboard auto-labeling system that reconstructs pedestrian trajectories from LiDAR point cloud and multi-view images. To improve the generalization power for crowded scenes and the performance for small objects, we propose to learn high-resolution representations that are density-aware and relationship-aware. Extensive experiments validate that our approach significantly improves the 3D pedestrian tracking performance towards higher auto-labeling efficiency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image-to-image translation aims to learn a mapping between a source and a target domain, enabling tasks such as style transfer, appearance transformation, and domain adaptation. In this work, we explore a diffusion-based framework for image-to-image translation by adapting Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which combine the denoising capabilities of diffusion models with the global modeling power of transformers. To guide the translation process, we condition the model on image embeddings extracted from a pre-trained CLIP encoder, allowing for fine-grained and structurally consistent translations without relying on text or class labels. We incorporate both a CLIP similarity loss to enforce semantic consistency and an LPIPS perceptual loss to enhance visual fidelity during training. We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets: face2comics, which translates real human faces to comic-style illustrations, and edges2shoes, which translates edge maps to realistic shoe images. Experimental results demonstrate that DiT, combined with CLIP-based conditioning and perceptual similarity objectives, achieves high-quality, semantically faithful translations, offering a promising alternative to GAN-based models for paired image-to-image translation tasks.

  Personalized models have demonstrated remarkable success in understanding and generating concepts provided by users. However, existing methods use separate concept tokens for understanding and generation, treating these tasks in isolation. This may result in limitations for generating images with complex prompts. For example, given the concept $\langle bo\rangle$, generating "$\langle bo\rangle$ wearing its hat" without additional textual descriptions of its hat. We call this kind of generation personalized knowledge-driven generation. To address the limitation, we present UniCTokens, a novel framework that effectively integrates personalized information into a unified vision language model (VLM) for understanding and generation. UniCTokens trains a set of unified concept tokens to leverage complementary semantics, boosting two personalized tasks. Moreover, we propose a progressive training strategy with three stages: understanding warm-up, bootstrapping generation from understanding, and deepening understanding from generation to enhance mutual benefits between both tasks. To quantitatively evaluate the unified VLM personalization, we present UnifyBench, the first benchmark for assessing concept understanding, concept generation, and knowledge-driven generation. Experimental results on UnifyBench indicate that UniCTokens shows competitive performance compared to leading methods in concept understanding, concept generation, and achieving state-of-the-art results in personalized knowledge-driven generation. Our research demonstrates that enhanced understanding improves generation, and the generation process can yield valuable insights into understanding.

  Large vision-language models exhibit inherent capabilities to handle diverse visual perception tasks. In this paper, we introduce VisionReasoner, a unified framework capable of reasoning and solving multiple visual perception tasks within a shared model. Specifically, by designing novel multi-object cognitive learning strategies and systematic task reformulation, VisionReasoner enhances its reasoning capabilities to analyze visual inputs, and addresses diverse perception tasks in a unified framework. The model generates a structured reasoning process before delivering the desired outputs responding to user queries. To rigorously assess unified visual perception capabilities, we evaluate VisionReasoner on ten diverse tasks spanning three critical domains: detection, segmentation, and counting. Experimental results show that VisionReasoner achieves superior performance as a unified model, outperforming Qwen2.5VL by relative margins of 29.1% on COCO (detection), 22.1% on ReasonSeg (segmentation), and 15.3% on CountBench (counting).

  Visual instruction tuning aims to enable large language models to comprehend the visual world, with a pivotal challenge lying in establishing an effective vision-to-language projection. However, existing methods often grapple with the intractable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we present LLaVA-Meteor, a novel approach designed to break this deadlock, equipped with a novel Top-Down Compression paradigm that strategically compresses visual tokens without compromising core information. Specifically, we construct a trainable Flash Global Fusion module based on efficient selective state space operators, which aligns the feature space while enabling each token to perceive holistic visual context and instruction preference at low cost. Furthermore, a local-to-single scanning manner is employed to effectively capture local dependencies, thereby enhancing the model's capability in vision modeling. To alleviate computational overhead, we explore a Visual-Native Selection mechanism that independently assesses token significance by both the visual and native experts, followed by aggregation to retain the most critical subset. Extensive experiments show that our approach reduces visual tokens by 75--95% while achieving comparable or superior performance across 12 benchmarks, significantly improving efficiency.

  Recent years have seen remarkable progress in both multimodal understanding models and image generation models. Despite their respective successes, these two domains have evolved independently, leading to distinct architectural paradigms: While autoregressive-based architectures have dominated multimodal understanding, diffusion-based models have become the cornerstone of image generation. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally, we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering resources for future exploration. Finally, we discuss the key challenges facing this nascent field, including tokenization strategy, cross-modal attention, and data. As this area is still in its early stages, we anticipate rapid advancements and will regularly update this survey. Our goal is to inspire further research and provide a valuable reference for the community. The references associated with this survey are available on GitHub (this https URL).

  Publicly available biomedical videos, such as those on YouTube, serve as valuable educational resources for medical students. Unlike standard machine learning datasets, these videos are designed for human learners, often mixing medical imagery with narration, explanatory diagrams, and contextual framing. In this work, we investigate whether such pedagogically rich, yet non-standardized and heterogeneous videos can effectively teach general-domain vision-language models biomedical knowledge. To this end, we introduce OpenBiomedVi, a biomedical video instruction tuning dataset comprising 1031 hours of video-caption and Q/A pairs, curated through a multi-step human-in-the-loop pipeline. Diverse biomedical video datasets are rare, and OpenBiomedVid fills an important gap by providing instruction-style supervision grounded in real-world educational content. Surprisingly, despite the informal and heterogeneous nature of these videos, the fine-tuned Qwen-2-VL models exhibit substantial performance improvements across most benchmarks. The 2B model achieves gains of 98.7% on video tasks, 71.2% on image tasks, and 0.2% on text tasks. The 7B model shows improvements of 37.09% on video and 11.2% on image tasks, with a slight degradation of 2.7% on text tasks compared to their respective base models. To address the lack of standardized biomedical video evaluation datasets, we also introduce two new expert curated benchmarks, MIMICEchoQA and SurgeryVideoQA. On these benchmarks, the 2B model achieves gains of 99.1% and 98.1%, while the 7B model shows gains of 22.5% and 52.1%, respectively, demonstrating the models' ability to generalize and perform biomedical video understanding on cleaner and more standardized datasets than those seen during training. These results suggest that educational videos created for human learning offer a surprisingly effective training signal for biomedical VLMs.

  Recent feature matching methods have achieved remarkable performance but lack efficiency consideration. In this paper, we revisit the mainstream detector-free matching pipeline and improve all its stages considering both accuracy and efficiency. We propose an Efficient Deep feature Matching network, EDM. We first adopt a deeper CNN with fewer dimensions to extract multi-level features. Then we present a Correlation Injection Module that conducts feature transformation on high-level deep features, and progressively injects feature correlations from global to local for efficient multi-scale feature aggregation, improving both speed and performance. In the refinement stage, a novel lightweight bidirectional axis-based regression head is designed to directly predict subpixel-level correspondences from latent features, avoiding the significant computational cost of explicitly locating keypoints on high-resolution local feature heatmaps. Moreover, effective selection strategies are introduced to enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our EDM achieves competitive matching accuracy on various benchmarks and exhibits excellent efficiency, offering valuable best practices for real-world applications.

  In recent years, rapid advances in computer vision have significantly improved the processing and generation of raster images. However, vector graphics, which is essential in digital design, due to its scalability and ease of editing, have been relatively understudied. Traditional vectorization techniques, which are often used in vector generation, suffer from long processing times and excessive output complexity, limiting their usability in practical applications. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for the generation, editing, and analysis of vector graphics, particularly in the SVG format, which is inherently text-based and well-suited for integration with LLMs.This paper provides a systematic review of existing LLM-based approaches for SVG processing, categorizing them into three main tasks: generation, editing, and understanding. We observe notable models such as IconShop, StrokeNUWA, and StarVector, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we analyze benchmark datasets designed for assessing SVG-related tasks, including SVGEditBench, VGBench, and SGP-Bench, and conduct a series of experiments to evaluate various LLMs in these domains. Our results demonstrate that for vector graphics reasoning-enhanced models outperform standard LLMs, particularly in generation and understanding tasks. Furthermore, our findings underscore the need to develop more diverse and richly annotated datasets to further improve LLM capabilities in vector graphics tasks.

  The development of larger models for medical image analysis has led to increased performance. However, it also affected our ability to explain and validate model decisions. Models can use non-relevant parts of images, also called spurious correlations or shortcuts, to obtain high performance on benchmark datasets but fail in real-world scenarios. In this work, we challenge the capacity of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify chest X-rays and eye fundus images while masking out clinically relevant parts of the image. We show that all models trained on the PadChest dataset, irrespective of the masking strategy, are able to obtain an Area Under the Curve (AUC) above random. Moreover, the models trained on full images obtain good performance on images without the region of interest (ROI), even superior to the one obtained on images only containing the ROI. We also reveal a possible spurious correlation in the Chaksu dataset while the performances are more aligned with the expectation of an unbiased model. We go beyond the performance analysis with the usage of the explainability method SHAP and the analysis of embeddings. We asked a radiology resident to interpret chest X-rays under different masking to complement our findings with clinical knowledge. Our code is available atthis https URLandthis https URL

  While reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing large language models (LLMs), it has primarily focused on single-turn tasks such as solving math problems. Training effective web agents for multi-turn interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of long-horizon decision-making across dynamic web interfaces. In this work, we present WebAgent-R1, a simple yet effective end-to-end multi-turn RL framework for training web agents. It learns directly from online interactions with web environments by asynchronously generating diverse trajectories, entirely guided by binary rewards depending on task success. Experiments on the WebArena-Lite benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of WebAgent-R1, boosting the task success rate of Qwen-2.5-3B from 6.1% to 33.9% and Llama-3.1-8B from 8.5% to 44.8%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and strong proprietary models such as OpenAI o3. In-depth analyses reveal the effectiveness of the thinking-based prompting strategy and test-time scaling through increased interactions for web tasks. We further investigate different RL initialization policies by introducing two variants, namely WebAgent-R1-Zero and WebAgent-R1-CoT, which highlight the importance of the warm-up training stage (i.e., behavior cloning) and provide insights on incorporating long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in web agents.

  The attention mechanism is a core primitive in modern large language models (LLMs) and AI more broadly. Since attention by itself is permutation-invariant, position encoding is essential for modeling structured domains such as language. Rotary position encoding (RoPE) has emerged as the de facto standard approach for position encoding and is part of many modern LLMs. However, in RoPE the key/query transformation between two elements in a sequence is only a function of their relative position and otherwise independent of the actual input. This limits the expressivity of RoPE-based transformers.This paper describes PaTH, a flexible data-dependent position encoding scheme based on accumulated products of Householder(like) transformations, where each transformation is data-dependent, i.e., a function of the input. We derive an efficient parallel algorithm for training through exploiting a compact representation of products of Householder matrices, and implement a FlashAttention-style blockwise algorithm that minimizes I/O cost. Across both targeted synthetic benchmarks and moderate-scale real-world language modeling experiments, we find that PaTH demonstrates superior performance compared to RoPE and other recent baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using expert demonstrations often suffer from the imitation problem, where the model learns to reproduce the correct responses without understanding the underlying rationale. To address this limitation, we propose Critique-Guided Distillation (CGD), a novel multi-stage framework that integrates teacher model generated explanatory critiques and refined responses into the SFT process. A student model is then trained to map the triplet of prompt, teacher critique, and its own initial response to the corresponding refined teacher response, thereby learning both what to imitate and why. Using entropy-based analysis, we show that CGD reduces refinement uncertainty and can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior update. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of CGD, on variety of benchmark tasks, and demonstrate significant gains on both math (AMC23 +17.5%) and language understanding tasks (MMLU-Pro +6.3%), while successfully mitigating the format drift issues observed in previous critique fine-tuning (CFT) techniques.

  Scaling test-time computation, or affording a generator large language model (LLM) extra compute during inference, typically employs the help of external non-generative evaluators (i.e., reward models). Concurrently, LLM-judges, models trained to generate evaluations and critiques (explanations) in natural language, are becoming increasingly popular in automatic evaluation. Despite judge empirical successes, their effectiveness as evaluators in test-time scaling settings is largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce the Judge Evaluation for Test-Time Scaling (JETTS) benchmark, which evaluates judge performance in three domains (math reasoning, code generation, and instruction following) under three task settings: response reranking, step-level beam search, and critique-based response refinement. We evaluate 10 different judge models (7B-70B parameters) for 8 different base generator models (6.7B-72B parameters). Our benchmark shows that while judges are competitive with outcome reward models in reranking, they are consistently worse than process reward models in beam search procedures. Furthermore, though unique to LLM-judges, their natural language critiques are currently ineffective in guiding the generator towards better responses.

  The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has profoundly impacted the document domain, creating a wide array of application scenarios. This progress highlights the need for a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate these models' capabilities across various document-specific tasks. However, existing benchmarks often fail to locate specific model weaknesses or guide systematic improvements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a General Document Intelligence Benchmark (GDI-Bench), featuring 2.3k images across 9 key scenarios and 19 document-specific tasks. By decoupling visual complexity and reasoning complexity, the GDI-Bench structures graded tasks that allow performance assessment by difficulty, aiding in model weakness identification and optimization guidance. We evaluate various open-source and closed-source models on GDI-Bench, conducting decoupled analyses in the visual and reasoning domains, revealing their strengths and weaknesses. To address the diverse tasks and domains in the GDI-Bench, we propose a GDI-Model that mitigates catastrophic forgetting during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process through an intelligence-preserving training strategy, thereby reinforcing the inherent weaknesses of the base model. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on previous benchmarks and the GDI-Bench. Both our benchmark and models are or will be open-sourced onthis https URL.

  Vision Language Models exhibited immense potential for embodied AI, yet they often lack the sophisticated situational reasoning required for complex decision-making. This paper shows that VLMs can achieve surprisingly strong decision-making performance when visual scenes are represented merely as text-only descriptions, suggesting foundational reasoning can be effectively learned from language. Motivated by this insight, we propose Praxis-VLM, a reasoning VLM for vision-grounded decision-making. Praxis-VLM employs the GRPO algorithm on textual scenarios to instill robust reasoning capabilities, where models learn to evaluate actions and their consequences. These reasoning skills, acquired purely from text, successfully transfer to multimodal inference with visual inputs, significantly reducing reliance on scarce paired image-text training data. Experiments across diverse decision-making benchmarks demonstrate that Praxis-VLM substantially outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning, exhibiting superior performance and generalizability. Further analysis confirms that our models engage in explicit and effective reasoning, underpinning their enhanced performance and adaptability.

  This paper introduces MMMU-Pro, a robust version of the Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning (MMMU) benchmark. MMMU-Pro rigorously assesses multimodal models' true understanding and reasoning capabilities through a three-step process based on MMMU: (1) filtering out questions answerable by text-only models, (2) augmenting candidate options, and (3) introducing a vision-only input setting where questions are embedded within images. This setting challenges AI to truly "see" and "read" simultaneously, testing a fundamental human cognitive skill of seamlessly integrating visual and textual information. Results show that model performance is substantially lower on MMMU-Pro than on MMMU, ranging from 16.8% to 26.9% across models. We explore the impact of OCR prompts and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, finding that OCR prompts have minimal effect while CoT generally improves performance. MMMU-Pro provides a more rigorous evaluation tool, closely mimicking real-world scenarios and offering valuable directions for future research in multimodal AI.

  LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing single LLMs to address complex and diverse tasks in practical applications. Despite considerable advancements, the field lacks a unified codebase that consolidates existing methods, resulting in redundant re-implementation efforts, unfair comparisons, and high entry barriers for researchers. To address these challenges, we introduce MASLab, a unified, comprehensive, and research-friendly codebase for LLM-based MAS. (1) MASLab integrates over 20 established methods across multiple domains, each rigorously validated by comparing step-by-step outputs with its official implementation. (2) MASLab provides a unified environment with various benchmarks for fair comparisons among methods, ensuring consistent inputs and standardized evaluation protocols. (3) MASLab implements methods within a shared streamlined structure, lowering the barriers for understanding and extension. Building on MASLab, we conduct extensive experiments covering 10+ benchmarks and 8 models, offering researchers a clear and comprehensive view of the current landscape of MAS methods. MASLab will continue to evolve, tracking the latest developments in the field, and invite contributions from the broader open-source community.

  Large language models (LLMs) based agent systems have made great strides in real-world applications beyond traditional NLP tasks. This paper proposes a new LLM-powered Multi-Agent System (LLM-MAS) benchmark, Collab-Overcooked, built on the popular Overcooked-AI game with more applicable and challenging tasks in interactive environments. Collab-Overcooked extends existing benchmarks from two novel perspectives. First, it provides a multi-agent framework supporting diverse tasks and objectives and encourages collaboration through natural language communication. Second, it introduces a spectrum of process-oriented evaluation metrics to assess the fine-grained collaboration capabilities of different LLM agents, a dimension often overlooked in prior work. We conduct extensive experiments over 11 popular LLMs and show that, while the LLMs present a strong ability in goal interpretation, there is a significant discrepancy in active collaboration and continuous adaptation which are critical for efficiently fulfilling complicated tasks. Notably, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-MAS and provide insights for improving and evaluating LLM-MAS on a unified and open-sourced benchmark. The environments, 30 open-ended tasks, and the evaluation package are publicly available atthis https URL.

  When language model (LM) users aim to improve the quality of its generations, it is crucial to specify concrete behavioral attributes that the model should strive to reflect. However, curating such principles across many domains, even non-exhaustively, requires a labor-intensive annotation process. To automate this process, we propose eliciting these latent attributes guiding model reasoning towards human-preferred responses by explicitly modeling them in a self-correction setting. Our approach mines new principles from the LM itself and compresses the discovered elements to an interpretable set via clustering. Specifically, we employ an approximation of posterior-regularized Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization to both identify a condensed set of the most effective latent principles and teach the LM to strategically invoke them in order to intrinsically refine its responses. We demonstrate that bootstrapping our algorithm over multiple iterations enables smaller language models (7-8B parameters) to self-improve, achieving +8-10% in AlpacaEval win-rate, an average of +0.3 on MT-Bench, and +19-23% in principle-following win-rate on IFEval. We also show that clustering the principles yields interpretable and diverse model-generated constitutions while retaining model performance. The gains our method achieves highlight the potential of automated, principle-driven post-training recipes toward continual self-improvement.

  Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in machine translation (MT). However, most advanced MT-specific LLMs heavily rely on external supervision signals during training, such as human-annotated reference data or trained reward models (RMs), which are often expensive to obtain and challenging to scale. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for MT that is reference-free, fully online, and relies solely on self-judging rewards. Training with SSR using 13K monolingual examples and Qwen-2.5-7B as the backbone, our model SSR-Zero-7B outperforms existing MT-specific LLMs, e.g., TowerInstruct-13B and GemmaX-28-9B, as well as larger general LLMs like Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation tasks from WMT23, WMT24, and Flores200 benchmarks. Furthermore, by augmenting SSR with external supervision from COMET, our strongest model, SSR-X-Zero-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation, surpassing all existing open-source models under 72B parameters and even outperforming closed-source models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of the self-rewarding mechanism compared to the external LLM-as-a-judge approach in MT and demonstrates its complementary benefits when combined with trained RMs. Our findings provide valuable insight into the potential of self-improving RL methods. We have publicly released our code, data and models.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs) combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context (ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context sentences without additional fine-tuning or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG models.

  Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL). However, leveraging the RL algorithm to empower effective multi-tool collaborative reasoning in LLMs remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Tool-Star, an RL-based framework designed to empower LLMs to autonomously invoke multiple external tools during stepwise reasoning. Tool-Star integrates six types of tools and incorporates systematic designs in both data synthesis and training. To address the scarcity of tool-use data, we propose a general tool-integrated reasoning data synthesis pipeline, which combines tool-integrated prompting with hint-based sampling to automatically and scalably generate tool-use trajectories. A subsequent quality normalization and difficulty-aware classification process filters out low-quality samples and organizes the dataset from easy to hard. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework to enhance multi-tool collaborative reasoning by: (1) cold-start fine-tuning, which guides LLMs to explore reasoning patterns via tool-invocation feedback; and (2) a multi-tool self-critic RL algorithm with hierarchical reward design, which reinforces reward understanding and promotes effective tool collaboration. Experimental analyses on over 10 challenging reasoning benchmarks highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of Tool-Star. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Large language models are typically adapted to downstream tasks through supervised fine-tuning on domain-specific data. While standard fine-tuning focuses on minimizing generation loss to optimize model parameters, we take a deeper step by retaining and leveraging the model's own learning signals, analogous to how human learners reflect on past mistakes to improve future performance. We first introduce the concept of Mistake Log to systematically track the model's learning behavior and recurring errors throughout fine-tuning. Treating the original transformer-based model as the Pilot, we correspondingly design a Copilot model to refine the Pilot's inference performance via logits rectification. We name the overall Pilot-Copilot framework the Transformer Copilot, which introduces (i) a novel Copilot model design, (ii) a joint training paradigm where the Copilot continuously learns from the evolving Mistake Log alongside the Pilot, and (iii) a fused inference paradigm where the Copilot rectifies the Pilot's logits for enhanced generation. We provide both theoretical and empirical analyses on our new learning framework. Experiments on 12 benchmarks spanning commonsense, arithmetic, and recommendation tasks demonstrate that Transformer Copilot consistently improves performance by up to 34.5%, while introducing marginal computational overhead to Pilot models and exhibiting strong scalability and transferability.

  Neural language models are black-boxes -- both linguistic patterns and factual knowledge are distributed across billions of opaque parameters. This entangled encoding makes it difficult to reliably inspect, verify, or update specific facts. We propose a new class of language models, Large Memory Language Models (LMLM) with a pre-training recipe that stores factual knowledge in both internal weights and an external database. Our approach strategically masks externally retrieved factual values from the training loss, thereby teaching the model to perform targeted lookups rather than relying on memorization in model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that LMLMs achieve competitive performance compared to significantly larger, knowledge-dense LLMs on standard benchmarks, while offering the advantages of explicit, editable, and verifiable knowledge bases. This work represents a fundamental shift in how language models interact with and manage factual knowledge.

  Effective social intelligence simulation requires language agents to dynamically adjust reasoning depth, a capability notably absent in current studies. Existing methods either lack this kind of reasoning capability or enforce Long Chain-of-Thought reasoning uniformly across all scenarios, resulting in excessive token usage and inflexible social simulation. To address this, we propose an $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{AML}$) framework in this paper, aiming to improve the adaptive thinking ability of language agents in dynamic social interactions. To this end, we first identify hierarchical thinking modes ranging from intuitive response to deep deliberation based on the cognitive control theory. We then develop the $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{AMPO}$) algorithm to optimize the context-aware mode switching and reasoning. Our framework advances existing research in three key aspects: (1) Multi-granular thinking mode design, (2) Context-aware mode switching across social interaction, and (3) Token-efficient reasoning via depth-adaptive processing. Extensive experiments on social intelligence benchmarks verify that AML achieves 15.6% higher task performance than GPT-4o. Notably, our AMPO outperforms GRPO by 7.0% with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains, demonstrating the advantage of adaptive thinking mode selection and optimization mechanism in AMPO over GRPO's fixed-depth solution.

  Transformers have become the de facto architecture for a wide range of machine learning tasks, particularly in large language models (LLMs). Despite their remarkable performance, challenges remain in training deep transformer networks, especially regarding the position of layer normalization. While Pre-Norm structures facilitate more stable training owing to their stronger identity path, they often lead to suboptimal performance compared to Post-Norm. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{HybridNorm}$, a simple yet effective hybrid normalization strategy that integrates the advantages of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm. Specifically, HybridNorm employs QKV normalization within the attention mechanism and Post-Norm in the feed-forward network (FFN) of each transformer block. We provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence demonstrating that HybridNorm improves gradient flow and model robustness. Extensive experiments on large-scale transformer models, including both dense and sparse variants, show that HybridNorm consistently outperforms both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches across multiple benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of HybridNorm as a more stable and effective technique for improving the training and performance of deep transformer models.

  We introduce SelfCite, a novel self-supervised approach that aligns LLMs to generate high-quality, fine-grained, sentence-level citations for the statements in their generated responses. Instead of only relying on costly and labor-intensive annotations, SelfCite leverages a reward signal provided by the LLM itself through context ablation: If a citation is necessary, removing the cited text from the context should prevent the same response; if sufficient, retaining the cited text alone should preserve the same response. This reward can guide the inference-time best-of-N sampling strategy to improve citation quality significantly, as well as be used in preference optimization to directly fine-tune the models for generating better citations. The effectiveness of SelfCite is demonstrated by increasing citation F1 up to 5.3 points on the LongBench-Cite benchmark across five long-form question answering tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as intelligent agents capable of solving complex problems. However, effective planning in scenarios involving dependencies between API or tool calls-particularly in multi-turn conversations-remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce T1, a tool-augmented, multi-domain, multi-turn conversational dataset specifically designed to capture and manage inter-tool dependencies across diverse domains. T1 enables rigorous evaluation of agents' ability to coordinate tool use across nine distinct domains (4 single domain and 5 multi-domain) with the help of an integrated caching mechanism for both short- and long-term memory, while supporting dynamic replanning-such as deciding whether to recompute or reuse cached results. Beyond facilitating research on tool use and planning, T1 also serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of open-source language models. We present results powered by T1-Agent, highlighting their ability to plan and reason in complex, tool-dependent scenarios.

  This study addresses the challenges in intelligent processing of Chinese ancient mathematical classics by constructing Guji_MATH, a benchmark for evaluating classical texts based on Suanjing Shishu. It systematically assesses the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of mainstream reasoning models under the unique linguistic constraints of classical Chinese. Through machine-assisted annotation and manual verification, 538 mathematical problems were extracted from 8 canonical texts, forming a structured dataset centered on the "Question-Answer-Solution" framework, supplemented by problem types and difficulty levels. Dual evaluation modes--closed-book (autonomous problem-solving) and open-book (reproducing classical solution methods)--were designed to evaluate the performance of six reasoning models on ancient Chinese mathematical problems. Results indicate that reasoning models can partially comprehend and solve these problems, yet their overall performance remains inferior to benchmarks on modern mathematical tasks. Enhancing models' classical Chinese comprehension and cultural knowledge should be prioritized for optimization. This study provides methodological support for mining mathematical knowledge from ancient texts and disseminating traditional culture, while offering new perspectives for evaluating cross-linguistic and cross-cultural capabilities of reasoning models.

  Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advancements, are fundamentally limited by their static parametric knowledge, hindering performance on tasks requiring open-domain up-to-date information. While enabling LLMs to interact with external knowledge environments is a promising solution, current efforts primarily address closed-end problems. Open-ended questions, which characterized by lacking a standard answer or providing non-unique and diverse answers, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present O$^2$-Searcher, a novel search agent leveraging reinforcement learning to effectively tackle both open-ended and closed-ended questions in the open domain. O$^2$-Searcher leverages an efficient, locally simulated search environment for dynamic knowledge acquisition, effectively decoupling the external world knowledge from model's sophisticated reasoning processes. It employs a unified training mechanism with meticulously designed reward functions, enabling the agent to identify problem types and adapt different answer generation strategies. Furthermore, to evaluate performance on complex open-ended tasks, we construct O$^2$-QA, a high-quality benchmark featuring 300 manually curated, multi-domain open-ended questions with associated web page caches. Extensive experiments show that O$^2$-Searcher, using only a 3B model, significantly surpasses leading LLM agents on O$^2$-QA. It also achieves SOTA results on various closed-ended QA benchmarks against similarly-sized models, while performing on par with much larger ones.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite significant progress, recent studies have indicated that current large language models (LLMs) may still utilize bias during inference, leading to the poor generalizability of LLMs. Some benchmarks are proposed to investigate the generalizability of LLMs, with each piece of data typically containing one type of controlled bias. However, a single piece of data may contain multiple types of biases in practical applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-bias benchmark where each piece of data contains five types of biases. The evaluations conducted on this benchmark reveal that the performance of existing LLMs and debiasing methods is unsatisfying, highlighting the challenge of eliminating multiple types of biases simultaneously. To overcome this challenge, we propose a causal effect estimation-guided multi-bias elimination method (CMBE). This method first estimates the causal effect of multiple types of biases simultaneously. Subsequently, we eliminate the causal effect of biases from the total causal effect exerted by both the semantic information and biases during inference. Experimental results show that CMBE can effectively eliminate multiple types of bias simultaneously to enhance the generalizability of LLMs.

  Incorporating external knowledge is crucial for knowledge-intensive tasks, such as question answering and fact checking. However, language models (LMs) may ignore relevant information that contradicts outdated parametric memory or be distracted by irrelevant contexts. While many context utilisation manipulation techniques (CMTs) that encourage or suppress context utilisation have recently been proposed to alleviate these issues, few have seen systematic comparison. In this paper, we develop CUB (Context Utilisation Benchmark) to help practitioners within retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) identify the best CMT for their needs. CUB allows for rigorous testing on three distinct context types, observed to capture key challenges in realistic context utilisation scenarios. With this benchmark, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art methods, representative of the main categories of CMTs, across three diverse datasets and tasks, applied to nine LMs. Our results show that most of the existing CMTs struggle to handle the full set of types of contexts that may be encountered in real-world retrieval-augmented scenarios. Moreover, we find that many CMTs display an inflated performance on simple synthesised datasets, compared to more realistic datasets with naturally occurring samples. Altogether, our results show the need for holistic tests of CMTs and the development of CMTs that can handle multiple context types.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models (LLMs) can solve PhD-level reasoning problems over long context inputs, they still struggle with a seemingly simpler task: following explicit length instructions-e.g., write a 10,000-word novel. Additionally, models often generate far too short outputs, terminate prematurely, or even refuse the request. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on evaluating generations quality, but often overlook whether the generations meet length constraints. To this end, we introduce Length Instruction Following Evaluation Benchmark (LIFEBench) to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' ability to follow length instructions across diverse tasks and a wide range of specified lengths. LIFEBench consists of 10,800 instances across 4 task categories in both English and Chinese, covering length constraints ranging from 16 to 8192 words. We evaluate 26 widely-used LLMs and find that most models reasonably follow short-length instructions but deteriorate sharply beyond a certain threshold. Surprisingly, almost all models fail to reach the vendor-claimed maximum output lengths in practice, as further confirmed by our evaluations extending up to 32K words. Even long-context LLMs, despite their extended input-output windows, counterintuitively fail to improve length-instructions following. Notably, Reasoning LLMs outperform even specialized long-text generation models, achieving state-of-the-art length following. Overall, LIFEBench uncovers fundamental limitations in current LLMs' length instructions following ability, offering critical insights for future progress.

  _Gagan Bhatia, Maxime Peyrard, Wei Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern BPE tokenizers often split calendar dates into meaningless fragments, e.g., 20250312 $\rightarrow$ 202, 503, 12, inflating token counts and obscuring the inherent structure needed for robust temporal reasoning. In this work, we (1) introduce a simple yet interpretable metric, termed date fragmentation ratio, that measures how faithfully a tokenizer preserves multi-digit date components; (2) release DateAugBench, a suite of 6500 examples spanning three temporal reasoning tasks: context-based date resolution, format-invariance puzzles, and date arithmetic across historical, contemporary, and future regimes; and (3) through layer-wise probing and causal attention-hop analyses, uncover an emergent date-abstraction mechanism whereby large language models stitch together the fragments of month, day, and year components for temporal reasoning. Our experiments show that excessive fragmentation correlates with accuracy drops of up to 10 points on uncommon dates like historical and futuristic dates. Further, we find that the larger the model, the faster the emergent date abstraction that heals date fragments is accomplished. Lastly, we observe a reasoning path that LLMs follow to assemble date fragments, typically differing from human interpretation (year $\rightarrow$ month $\rightarrow$ day).

  _Roland Daynauth, Christopher Clarke, Krisztian Flautner, Lingjia Tang, Jason Mars_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm offers a scalable, reference-free approach for evaluating language models. Although several calibration techniques have been proposed to better align these evaluators with human judgment, prior studies focus primarily on narrow, well-structured benchmarks. As a result, it remains unclear whether such calibrations generalize to real-world, open-ended tasks.In this work, we show that SOTA calibrated evaluators often fail in these settings, exhibiting weak or even negative correlation with human judgments. To address this, we propose SLMEval, a novel and efficient calibration method based on entropy maximization over a small amount of human preference data. By estimating a latent distribution over model quality and reweighting evaluator scores accordingly, SLMEval achieves strong correlation with human evaluations across two real-world production use cases and the public benchmark. For example, on one such task, SLMEval achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.57 with human judgments, while G-Eval yields a negative correlation. In addition, SLMEval reduces evaluation costs by 5-30x compared to GPT-4-based calibrated evaluators such as G-eval.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of language models has demonstrated the potential of artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry. However, small language models struggle with specialized domains in low-resource languages like Persian. While numerous medical-domain websites exist in Persian, no curated dataset or corpus has been available making ours the first of its kind. This study explores the enhancement of medical knowledge in a small language model by leveraging accessible online data, including a crawled corpus from medical magazines and a dataset of real doctor-patient QA pairs. We fine-tuned a baseline model using our curated data to improve its medical knowledge. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves improved accuracy in medical question answering and provides better responses compared to its baseline. This work highlights the potential of leveraging open-access online data to enrich small language models in medical fields, providing a novel solution for Persian medical AI applications suitable for resource-constrained environments.

  This paper presents BR-TaxQA-R, a novel dataset designed to support question answering with references in the context of Brazilian personal income tax law. The dataset contains 715 questions from the 2024 official Q\&A document published by Brazil's Internal Revenue Service, enriched with statutory norms and administrative rulings from the Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais (CARF). We implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using OpenAI embeddings for searching and GPT-4o-mini for answer generation. We compare different text segmentation strategies and benchmark our system against commercial tools such as ChatGPT andthis http URLusing RAGAS-based metrics. Results show that our custom RAG pipeline outperforms commercial systems in Response Relevancy, indicating stronger alignment with user queries, while commercial models achieve higher scores in Factual Correctness and fluency. These findings highlight a trade-off between legally grounded generation and linguistic fluency. Crucially, we argue that human expert evaluation remains essential to ensure the legal validity of AI-generated answers in high-stakes domains such as taxation.

  While integrating external tools into large language models (LLMs) enhances their ability to access real-time information and domain-specific services, existing approaches focus narrowly on functional tool selection following user instructions, overlooking the context-aware personalization in tool selection. This oversight leads to suboptimal user satisfaction and inefficient tool utilization, particularly when overlapping toolsets require nuanced selection based on contextual factors. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolSpectrum, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in personalized tool utilization. Specifically, we formalize two key dimensions of personalization, user profile and environmental factors, and analyze their individual and synergistic impacts on tool utilization. Through extensive experiments on ToolSpectrum, we demonstrate that personalized tool utilization significantly improves user experience across diverse scenarios. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit the limited ability to reason jointly about user profiles and environmental factors, often prioritizing one dimension at the expense of the other. Our findings underscore the necessity of context-aware personalization in tool-augmented LLMs and reveal critical limitations for current models. Our data and code are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucination, i.e., generating factually incorrect content, remains a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). We introduce TOHA, a TOpology-based HAllucination detector in the RAG setting, which leverages a topological divergence metric to quantify the structural properties of graphs induced by attention matrices. Examining the topological divergence between prompt and response subgraphs reveals consistent patterns: higher divergence values in specific attention heads correlate with hallucinated outputs, independent of the dataset. Extensive experiments - including evaluation on question answering and summarization tasks - show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on several benchmarks while requiring minimal annotated data and computational resources. Our findings suggest that analyzing the topological structure of attention matrices can serve as an efficient and robust indicator of factual reliability in LLMs.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but their development has primarily focused on English and other high-resource languages, leaving many languages underserved. We present our latest Hindi-English bi-lingual LLM \textbf{Mantra-14B} with ~3\% average improvement in benchmark scores over both languages, outperforming models twice its size. Using a curated dataset composed of English and Hindi instruction data of 485K samples, we instruction tuned models such as Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct and Phi-4 to improve performance over both English and Hindi. Our experiments encompassing seven different LLMs of varying parameter sizes and over 140 training attempts with varying English-Hindi training data ratios demonstrated that it is possible to significantly improve multilingual performance without compromising native performance. Further, our approach avoids resource-intensive techniques like vocabulary expansion or architectural modifications, thus keeping the model size small. Our results indicate that modest fine-tuning with culturally and locally informed data can bridge performance gaps without incurring significant computational overhead. We release our training code, datasets, and models under mit and apache licenses to aid further research towards under-represented and low-resource languages.

  Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally been aligned through one-size-fits-all approaches that assume uniform human preferences, fundamentally overlooking the diversity in user values and needs. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for scalable personalized alignment of LLMs. We establish a systematic preference space characterizing psychological and behavioral dimensions, alongside diverse persona representations for robust preference inference in real-world scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we introduce \textsc{AlignX}, a large-scale dataset of over 1.3 million personalized preference examples, and develop two complementary alignment approaches: \textit{in-context alignment} directly conditioning on persona representations and \textit{preference-bridged alignment} modeling intermediate preference distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over existing methods, with an average 17.06\% accuracy gain across four benchmarks while exhibiting a strong adaptation capability to novel preferences, robustness to limited user data, and precise preference controllability. These results validate our approach toward user-adaptive AI systems.

  Recent works integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have shown promising improvements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on closed-ended tasks, leaving a gap in evaluating performance on more complex, real-world scenarios. This limitation also hinders a thorough assessment of KGs' potential to reduce hallucinations in LLMs. To address this, we introduce OKGQA, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs augmented with KGs in open-ended, real-world question answering settings. OKGQA reflects practical complexities through diverse question types and incorporates metrics to quantify both hallucination rates and reasoning improvements in LLM+KG models. To consider the scenarios in which KGs may contain varying levels of errors, we propose a benchmark variant, OKGQA-P, to assess model performance when the semantics and structure of KGs are deliberately perturbed and contaminated. In this paper, we aims to (1) explore whether KGs can make LLMs more trustworthy in an open-ended setting, and (2) conduct a comparative analysis to shed light on method design. We believe this study can facilitate a more complete performance comparison and encourages continuous improvement in integrating KGs with LLMs to mitigate hallucination, and make LLMs more trustworthy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, particularly in long-form generations. A promising direction to mitigate hallucination is to teach LLMs to express uncertainty explicitly when they lack sufficient knowledge. However, existing work lacks direct and fair evaluation of LLMs' ability to express uncertainty effectively in long-form generation. To address this gap, we first introduce UNCLE, a benchmark designed to evaluate uncertainty expression in both long- and short-form question answering (QA). UNCLE spans five domains and comprises 4k long-form QA instances and over 20k short-form QA pairs. Our dataset is the first to directly bridge short- and long-form QA with paired questions and gold-standard answers. Along with the benchmark, we propose a suite of new metrics to assess the models' capabilities to selectively express uncertainty. Using UNCLE, we then demonstrate that current models fail to convey uncertainty appropriately in long-form generation. We further explore both prompt-based and training-based methods to improve models' performance, with the training-based methods yielding greater gains. Further analysis of alignment gaps between short- and long-form uncertainty expression highlights promising directions for future research using UNCLE.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong instruction-following capabilities in text-based tasks. However, this ability often deteriorates in multimodal models after alignment with non-text modalities such as images or audio. While several recent efforts have investigated instruction-following performance in text and vision-language models, instruction-following in audio-based large language models remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce IFEval-Audio, a novel evaluation dataset designed to assess the ability to follow instructions in an audio LLM. IFEval-Audio contains 280 audio-instruction-answer triples across six diverse dimensions: Content, Capitalization, Symbol, List Structure, Length, and Format. Each example pairs an audio input with a text instruction, requiring the model to generate an output that follows a specified structure. We benchmark state-of-the-art audio LLMs on their ability to follow audio-involved instructions. The dataset is released publicly to support future research in this emerging area.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance, the multimodal instruction tuning stage often causes catastrophic forgetting of the base LLM's language ability, even in strong models like Llama3. To address this, we propose Locate-then-Merge, a training-free parameter fusion framework that first locates important parameters and then selectively merges them. We further introduce Neuron-Fusion, a neuron-level strategy that preserves the influence of neurons with large parameter shifts--neurons likely responsible for newly acquired visual capabilities--while attenuating the influence of neurons with smaller changes that likely encode general-purpose language skills. This design enables better retention of visual adaptation while mitigating language degradation. Experiments on 13 benchmarks across both language and visual tasks show that Neuron-Fusion consistently outperforms existing model merging methods. Further analysis reveals that our method effectively reduces context hallucination in generation.

  We present a Japanese domain-specific language model for the pharmaceutical field, developed through continual pretraining on 2 billion Japanese pharmaceutical tokens and 8 billion English biomedical tokens. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce three new benchmarks: YakugakuQA, based on national pharmacist licensing exams; NayoseQA, which tests cross-lingual synonym and terminology normalization; and SogoCheck, a novel task designed to assess consistency reasoning between paired statements. We evaluate our model against both open-source medical LLMs and commercial models, including GPT-4o. Results show that our domain-specific model outperforms existing open models and achieves competitive performance with commercial ones, particularly on terminology-heavy and knowledge-based tasks. Interestingly, even GPT-4o performs poorly on SogoCheck, suggesting that cross-sentence consistency reasoning remains an open challenge. Our benchmark suite offers a broader diagnostic lens for pharmaceutical NLP, covering factual recall, lexical variation, and logical consistency. This work demonstrates the feasibility of building practical, secure, and cost-effective language models for Japanese domain-specific applications, and provides reusable evaluation resources for future research in pharmaceutical and healthcare NLP.

  We introduce KoLasSimpleQA, the first benchmark evaluating the multilingual factual ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by existing research, we created the question set with features such as single knowledge point coverage, absolute objectivity, unique answers, and temporal stability. These questions enable efficient evaluation using the LLM-as-judge paradigm, testing both the LLMs' factual memory and self-awareness ("know what they don't know"). KoLasSimpleQA expands existing research in two key dimensions: (1) Breadth (Multilingual Coverage): It includes 9 languages, supporting global applicability evaluation. (2) Depth (Dual Domain Design): It covers both the general domain (global facts) and the language-specific domain (such as history, culture, and regional traditions) for a comprehensive assessment of multilingual capabilities. We evaluated mainstream LLMs, including traditional LLM and emerging Large Reasoning Models. Results show significant performance differences between the two domains, particularly in performance metrics, ranking, calibration, and robustness. This highlights the need for targeted evaluation and optimization in multilingual contexts. We hope KoLasSimpleQA will help the research community better identify LLM capability boundaries in multilingual contexts and provide guidance for model optimization. We will release KoLasSimpleQA atthis https URL.

  _Spencer Hong, Meng Luo, Xinyi Wan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Determining the veracity of atomic claims is an imperative component of many recently proposed fact-checking systems. Many approaches tackle this problem by first retrieving evidence by querying a search engine and then performing classification by providing the evidence set and atomic claim to a large language model, but this process deviates from what a human would do in order to perform the task. Recent work attempted to address this issue by proposing iterative evidence retrieval, allowing for evidence to be collected several times and only when necessary. Continuing along this line of research, we propose a novel claim verification system, called EMULATE, which is designed to better emulate human actions through the use of a multi-agent framework where each agent performs a small part of the larger task, such as ranking search results according to predefined criteria or evaluating webpage content. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show clear improvements over prior work, demonstrating the efficacy of our new multi-agent framework.

  Prior benchmarks for evaluating the domain-specific knowledge of large language models (LLMs) lack the scalability to handle complex academic tasks. To address this, we introduce \texttt{ScholarBench}, a benchmark centered on deep expert knowledge and complex academic problem-solving, which evaluates the academic reasoning ability of LLMs and is constructed through a three-step process. \texttt{ScholarBench} targets more specialized and logically complex contexts derived from academic literature, encompassing five distinct problem types. Unlike prior benchmarks, \texttt{ScholarBench} evaluates the abstraction, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs across eight distinct research domains. To ensure high-quality evaluation data, we define category-specific example attributes and design questions that are aligned with the characteristic research methodologies and discourse structures of each domain. Additionally, this benchmark operates as an English-Korean bilingual dataset, facilitating simultaneous evaluation for linguistic capabilities of LLMs in both languages. The benchmark comprises 5,031 examples in Korean and 5,309 in English, with even state-of-the-art models like o3-mini achieving an average evaluation score of only 0.543, demonstrating the challenging nature of this benchmark.

  Language confusion -- where large language models (LLMs) generate unintended languages against the user's need -- remains a critical challenge, especially for English-centric models. We present the first mechanistic interpretability (MI) study of language confusion, combining behavioral benchmarking with neuron-level analysis. Using the Language Confusion Benchmark (LCB), we show that confusion points (CPs) -- specific positions where language switches occur -- are central to this phenomenon. Through layer-wise analysis with TunedLens and targeted neuron attribution, we reveal that transition failures in the final layers drive confusion. We further demonstrate that editing a small set of critical neurons, identified via comparative analysis with multilingual-tuned models, substantially mitigates confusion without harming general competence or fluency. Our approach matches multilingual alignment in confusion reduction for most languages and yields cleaner, higher-quality outputs. These findings provide new insights into the internal dynamics of LLMs and highlight neuron-level interventions as a promising direction for robust, interpretable multilingual language modeling.

  Recent advances in LegalAI have primarily focused on individual case judgment analysis, often overlooking the critical appellate process within the judicial system. Appeals serve as a core mechanism for error correction and ensuring fair trials, making them highly significant both in practice and in research. To address this gap, we present the AppealCase dataset, consisting of 10,000 pairs of real-world, matched first-instance and second-instance documents across 91 categories of civil cases. The dataset also includes detailed annotations along five dimensions central to appellate review: judgment reversals, reversal reasons, cited legal provisions, claim-level decisions, and whether there is new information in the second instance. Based on these annotations, we propose five novel LegalAI tasks and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 20 mainstream models. Experimental results reveal that all current models achieve less than 50% F1 scores on the judgment reversal prediction task, highlighting the complexity and challenge of the appeal scenario. We hope that the AppealCase dataset will spur further research in LegalAI for appellate case analysis and contribute to improving consistency in judicial decision-making.

  Large Language Model (LLM) routing is a pivotal technique for navigating a diverse landscape of LLMs, aiming to select the best-performing LLMs tailored to the domains of user queries, while managing computational resources. However, current routing approaches often face limitations in scalability when dealing with a large pool of specialized LLMs, or in their adaptability to extending model scope and evolving capability domains. To overcome those challenges, we propose InferenceDynamics, a flexible and scalable multi-dimensional routing framework by modeling the capability and knowledge of models. We operate it on our comprehensive dataset RouteMix, and demonstrate its effectiveness and generalizability in group-level routing using modern benchmarks including MMLU-Pro, GPQA, BigGenBench, and LiveBench, showcasing its ability to identify and leverage top-performing models for given tasks, leading to superior outcomes with efficient resource utilization. The broader adoption of Inference Dynamics can empower users to harness the full specialized potential of the LLM ecosystem, and our code will be made publicly available to encourage further research.

  _Seongryong Jung, Suwan Yoon, DongGeon Kim, Hwanhee Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) offer impressive performance but are impractical for resource-constrained deployment due to high latency and energy consumption. Knowledge distillation (KD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from a large teacher to a smaller student model. However, conventional KD, notably approaches like Forward KL (FKL) and Reverse KL (RKL), apply uniform divergence loss across the entire vocabulary, neglecting token-level prediction discrepancies. By investigating these representative divergences via gradient analysis, we reveal that FKL boosts underestimated tokens, while RKL suppresses overestimated ones, showing their complementary roles. Based on this observation, we propose Token-wise Distillation (ToDi), a novel method that adaptively combines FKL and RKL per token using a sigmoid-based weighting function derived from the teacher-student probability log-ratio. ToDi dynamically emphasizes the appropriate divergence for each token, enabling precise distribution alignment. We demonstrate that ToDi consistently outperforms recent distillation baselines using uniform or less granular strategies across instruction-following benchmarks.

  The achievements of Large Language Models in Natural Language Processing, especially for high-resource languages, call for a better understanding of their characteristics from a cognitive perspective. Researchers have attempted to evaluate artificial models by testing their ability to predict behavioral (e.g., eye-tracking fixations) and physiological (e.g., brain responses) variables during language processing (e.g., reading/listening). In this paper, we propose using spontaneous speech corpora to derive production variables (speech reductions, prosodic prominences) and applying them in a similar fashion. More precisely, we extract. We then test models trained with a standard procedure on different pretraining datasets (written, spoken, and mixed genres) for their ability to predict these two variables. Our results show that, after some fine-tuning, the models can predict these production variables well above baselines. We also observe that spoken genre training data provides more accurate predictions than written genres. These results contribute to the broader effort of using high-quality speech corpora as benchmarks for LLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with issues like hallucinations and outdated information. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses these issues by grounding LLM outputs in external knowledge with an Information Retrieval (IR) system. Building on this foundation, graph-based RAG systems go a step further by retrieving subgraphs, which preserve the relationships between knowledge entities and provide more comprehensive context. However, graph RAG faces two challenges: (1) Retrieving relevant information introduces irrelevant nodes (especially in dense graph databases, where retrieval usually extends to adjacent nodes), and leads to overly lengthy inputs that hinder efficiency; (2) The representation gap between graph and language during generation with LLMs limits the ability to fully leverage graph structures for enhanced understanding. To address these limitations, we propose Align-GRAG, a novel reasoning-guided dual alignment framework in post-retrieval phrase. It first formulates a subgraph by retrieving nodes and edges. Then an Aligner is proposed to jointly optimizes a graph encoder with LLM-summarized reasoning. It achieves dual alignment of graph node and representation by leveraging KL divergence loss and contrastive loss, facilitating efficient pruning of irrelevant knowledge and establishing a unified semantic space. The Generator integrates the aligned graph data with LLM to produce coherent and accurate answers. Experiments on GraphQA benchmark across three tasks (including common sense reasoning, scene graph understanding, and knowledge graph reasoning) validate the effectiveness of our method. The code will be available upon accepted.

  As large language models continue to advance, their application in educational contexts remains underexplored and under-optimized. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing the first diverse benchmark tailored for educational scenarios, incorporating synthetic data containing 9 major scenarios and over 4,000 distinct educational contexts. To enable comprehensive assessment, we propose a set of multi-dimensional evaluation metrics that cover 12 critical aspects relevant to both teachers and students. We further apply human annotation to ensure the effectiveness of the model-generated evaluation responses. Additionally, we succeed to train a relatively small-scale model on our constructed dataset and demonstrate that it can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art large models (e.g., Deepseek V3, Qwen Max) on the test set. Overall, this work provides a practical foundation for the development and evaluation of education-oriented language models. Code and data are released atthis https URL.

  We introduce KoBALT (Korean Benchmark for Advanced Linguistic Tasks), a comprehensive linguistically-motivated benchmark comprising 700 multiple-choice questions spanning 24 phenomena across five linguistic domains: syntax, semantics, pragmatics, phonetics/phonology, and morphology. KoBALT is designed to advance the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in Korean, a morphologically rich language, by addressing the limitations of conventional benchmarks that often lack linguistic depth and typological grounding. It introduces a suite of expert-curated, linguistically motivated questions with minimal n-gram overlap with standard Korean corpora, substantially mitigating the risk of data contamination and allowing a more robust assessment of true language understanding. Our evaluation of 20 contemporary LLMs reveals significant performance disparities, with the highest-performing model achieving 61\% general accuracy but showing substantial variation across linguistic domains - from stronger performance in semantics (66\%) to considerable weaknesses in phonology (31\%) and morphology (36\%). Through human preference evaluation with 95 annotators, we demonstrate a strong correlation between KoBALT scores and human judgments, validating our benchmark's effectiveness as a discriminative measure of Korean language understanding. KoBALT addresses critical gaps in linguistic evaluation for typologically diverse languages and provides a robust framework for assessing genuine linguistic competence in Korean language models.

  While bariatric and metabolic surgery (MBS) is considered the gold standard treatment for severe and morbid obesity, its therapeutic efficacy hinges upon active and longitudinal engagement with multidisciplinary providers, including surgeons, dietitians/nutritionists, psychologists, and endocrinologists. This engagement spans the entire patient journey, from preoperative preparation to long-term postoperative management. However, this process is often hindered by numerous healthcare disparities, such as logistical and access barriers, which impair easy patient access to timely, evidence-based, clinician-endorsed information. To address these gaps, we introduce bRAGgen, a novel adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based model that autonomously integrates real-time medical evidence when response confidence dips below dynamic thresholds. This self-updating architecture ensures that responses remain current and accurate, reducing the risk of misinformation. Additionally, we present bRAGq, a curated dataset of 1,302 bariatric surgery--related questions, validated by an expert bariatric surgeon. bRAGq constitutes the first large-scale, domain-specific benchmark for comprehensive MBS care. In a two-phase evaluation, bRAGgen is benchmarked against state-of-the-art models using both large language model (LLM)--based metrics and expert surgeon review. Across all evaluation dimensions, bRAGgen demonstrates substantially superior performance in generating clinically accurate and relevant responses.

  Process Reward Models (PRMs), which provide step-by-step feedback on the reasoning generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), are receiving increasing attention. However, two key research gaps remain: collecting accurate step-level error labels for training typically requires costly human annotation, and existing PRMs are limited to math reasoning problems. In response to these gaps, this paper aims to address the challenges of automatic dataset creation and the generalization of PRMs to diverse reasoning tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose FoVer, an approach for training PRMs on step-level error labels automatically annotated by formal verification tools, such as Z3 for formal logic and Isabelle for theorem proof, which provide automatic and accurate verification for symbolic tasks. Using this approach, we synthesize a training dataset with error labels on LLM responses for formal logic and theorem proof tasks without human annotation. Although this data synthesis is feasible only for tasks compatible with formal verification, we observe that LLM-based PRMs trained on our dataset exhibit cross-task generalization, improving verification across diverse reasoning tasks. Specifically, PRMs trained with FoVer significantly outperform baseline PRMs based on the original LLMs and achieve competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art PRMs trained on labels annotated by humans or stronger models, as measured by step-level verification on ProcessBench and Best-of-K performance across 12 reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME, ANLI, MMLU, and BBH.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in diverse reasoning tasks, yet their application to complex physics reasoning remains underexplored. Physics reasoning presents unique challenges, requiring grounding in physical conditions and the interpretation of multimodal information. Current physics benchmarks are limited, often focusing on text-only inputs or solely on problem-solving, thereby overlooking the critical intermediate steps of variable identification and process formulation. To address these limitations, we introduce PhysicsArena, the first multimodal physics reasoning benchmark designed to holistically evaluate MLLMs across three critical dimensions: variable identification, physical process formulation, and solution derivation. PhysicsArena aims to provide a comprehensive platform for assessing and advancing the multimodal physics reasoning abilities of MLLMs.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly advance, we introduce Hunyuan-TurboS, a novel large hybrid Transformer-Mamba Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. It synergistically combines Mamba's long-sequence processing efficiency with Transformer's superior contextual understanding. Hunyuan-TurboS features an adaptive long-short chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism, dynamically switching between rapid responses for simple queries and deep "thinking" modes for complex problems, optimizing computational resources. Architecturally, this 56B activated (560B total) parameter model employs 128 layers (Mamba2, Attention, FFN) with an innovative AMF/MF block pattern. Faster Mamba2 ensures linear complexity, Grouped-Query Attention minimizes KV cache, and FFNs use an MoE structure. Pre-trained on 16T high-quality tokens, it supports a 256K context length and is the first industry-deployed large-scale Mamba model. Our comprehensive post-training strategy enhances capabilities via Supervised Fine-Tuning (3M instructions), a novel Adaptive Long-short CoT Fusion method, Multi-round Deliberation Learning for iterative improvement, and a two-stage Large-scale Reinforcement Learning process targeting STEM and general instruction-following. Evaluations show strong performance: overall top 7 rank on LMSYS Chatbot Arena with a score of 1356, outperforming leading models like Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 (1352) and o4-mini-2025-04-16 (1345). TurboS also achieves an average of 77.9% across 23 automated benchmarks. Hunyuan-TurboS balances high performance and efficiency, offering substantial capabilities at lower inference costs than many reasoning models, establishing a new paradigm for efficient large-scale pre-trained models.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Particularly, the "Zero" reinforcement learning introduced by Deepseek-R1-Zero, enables direct RL training of base LLMs without relying on an intermediate supervised fine-tuning stage. Despite these advancements, current works for LLM reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data abundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce. In this paper, we propose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Our key contributions include: (1) constructing a large-scale, high-quality dataset of questions with verifiable answers curated by web crawling, covering a wide range of disciplines; and (2) developing a generative model-based answer verifier, which replaces traditional rule-based verification with the capability of chain-of-thought and context-awareness. We train a series of models and evaluate them on a wide range of datasets covering wide domains like physics, chemistry, finance, electronics etc. Our comprehensive evaluation across these 12 benchmarks (e.g. MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, TheoremQA, BBEH and MATH AMC) demonstrates that General-Reasoner outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving robust and generalizable reasoning performance while maintaining superior effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.

  Distillation has emerged as a practical and effective approach to enhance the reasoning capabilities of open-source language models. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on reasoning data distillation by collecting verified outputs from three state-of-the-art teacher models-AM-Thinking-v1, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-R1-on a shared corpus of 1.89 million queries. We construct three parallel datasets and analyze their distributions, revealing that AM-Thinking-v1-distilled data exhibits greater token length diversity and lower perplexity. Student models trained on each dataset are evaluated on reasoning benchmarks including AIME2024, AIME2025, MATH500, and LiveCodeBench. The model distilled from AM-Thinking-v1 consistently achieves the best performance (e.g., 84.3 on AIME2024, 72.2 on AIME2025, 98.4 on MATH500, and 65.9 on LiveCodeBench) and demonstrates adaptive output behavior-producing longer responses for harder tasks and shorter ones for simpler tasks. These findings highlight the value of high-quality, verified reasoning traces. We release the AM-Thinking-v1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B distilled datasets to support future research on open and high-performing reasoning-oriented language models. The datasets are publicly available on Hugging Face\footnote{Datasets are available on Hugging Face: \href{this https URL}{AM-Thinking-v1-Distilled}, \href{this https URL}{AM-Qwen3-Distilled}.}.

  Optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) performance requires well-crafted prompts, but manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and often ineffective. Automated prompt optimization techniques address this challenge but the majority of them rely on randomly selected evaluation subsets, which fail to represent the full dataset, leading to unreliable evaluations and suboptimal prompts. Existing coreset selection methods, designed for LLM benchmarking, are unsuitable for prompt optimization due to challenges in clustering similar samples, high data collection costs, and the unavailability of performance data for new or private datasets. To overcome these issues, we propose IPOMP, an Iterative evaluation data selection for effective Prompt Optimization using real-time Model Performance. IPOMP is a two-stage approach that selects representative and diverse samples using semantic clustering and boundary analysis, followed by iterative refinement with real-time model performance data to replace redundant samples. Evaluations on the BIG-bench dataset show that IPOMP improves effectiveness by 1.6% to 5.3% and stability by at least 57% compared with SOTA baselines, with minimal computational overhead below 1%. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that our real-time performance-guided refinement approach can be universally applied to enhance existing coreset selection methods.

  As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, it is essential to assess how they perform on established benchmarks. In this study, we present a suite of experiments to assess the performance of modern LLMs (ranging from 3B to 90B+ parameters) on CaseHOLD, a legal benchmark dataset for identifying case holdings. Our experiments demonstrate ``scaling effects'' - performance on this task improves with model size, with more capable models like GPT4o and AmazonNovaPro achieving macro F1 scores of 0.744 and 0.720 respectively. These scores are competitive with the best published results on this dataset, and do not require any technically sophisticated model training, fine-tuning or few-shot prompting. To ensure that these strong results are not due to memorization of judicial opinions contained in the training data, we develop and utilize a novel citation anonymization test that preserves semantic meaning while ensuring case names and citations are fictitious. Models maintain strong performance under these conditions (macro F1 of 0.728), suggesting the performance is not due to rote memorization. These findings demonstrate both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for legal tasks with important implications for the development and measurement of automated legal analytics and legal benchmarks.

  Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in formal theorem proving, yet existing benchmarks remain limited to isolated, static proof tasks, failing to capture the iterative, engineering-intensive workflows of real-world formal mathematics libraries. Motivated by analogous advances in software engineering, we introduce the paradigm of Automated Proof Engineering (APE), which aims to automate proof engineering tasks such as feature addition, proof refactoring, and bug fixing using LLMs. To facilitate research in this direction, we present APE-Bench I, the first realistic benchmark built from real-world commit histories of Mathlib4, featuring diverse file-level tasks described in natural language and verified via a hybrid approach combining the Lean compiler and LLM-as-a-Judge. We further develop Eleanstic, a scalable parallel verification infrastructure optimized for proof checking across multiple versions of Mathlib. Empirical results on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate strong performance on localized edits but substantial degradation on handling complex proof engineering. This work lays the foundation for developing agentic workflows in proof engineering, with future benchmarks targeting multi-file coordination, project-scale verification, and autonomous agents capable of planning, editing, and repairing formal libraries.

Our evaluation shows that current MLLMs face fundamental challenges in vision-language alignment and domain adaptation, highlighting a critical gap in current benchmarks. By providing a scalable and rigorous framework, DomainCQA enables more precise assessment and improvement of MLLMs for domain-specific applications.

  Improving training efficiency continues to be one of the primary challenges in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate how context length and the complexity of training data influence the RL scaling training process of R1-distilled small reasoning models, e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) simply controlling the context length and curating the training data based on the input prompt length can effectively improve the training efficiency of scaling RL, achieving better performance with more concise CoT; (2) properly scaling the context length helps mitigate entropy collapse; and (3) choosing an optimal context length can improve the efficiency of model training and incentivize the model's chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities. Inspired by these insights, we propose FastCuRL, a curriculum RL framework with stage-wise context scaling to achieve efficient training and concise CoT reasoning. Experiment results demonstrate that FastCuRL-1.5B-V3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on five competition-level benchmarks and achieves 49.6\% accuracy on AIME 2024. Furthermore, FastCuRL-1.5B-Preview surpasses DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview on five benchmarks while only using a single node with 8 GPUs and a total of 50\% of training steps. %The code, training data, and models will be publicly released.

  Academic paper review is a critical yet time-consuming task within the research community. With the increasing volume of academic publications, automating the review process has become a significant challenge. The primary issue lies in generating comprehensive, accurate, and reasoning-consistent review comments that align with human reviewers' judgments. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing ReviewAgents, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate academic paper reviews. We first introduce a novel dataset, Review-CoT, consisting of 142k review comments, designed for training LLM agents. This dataset emulates the structured reasoning process of human reviewers-summarizing the paper, referencing relevant works, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and generating a review conclusion. Building upon this, we train LLM reviewer agents capable of structured reasoning using a relevant-paper-aware training method. Furthermore, we construct ReviewAgents, a multi-role, multi-LLM agent review framework, to enhance the review comment generation process. Additionally, we propose ReviewBench, a benchmark for evaluating the review comments generated by LLMs. Our experimental results on ReviewBench demonstrate that while existing LLMs exhibit a certain degree of potential for automating the review process, there remains a gap when compared to human-generated reviews. Moreover, our ReviewAgents framework further narrows this gap, outperforming advanced LLMs in generating review comments.

  Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. One key concept in spatial cognition is the Frame of Reference (FoR), which identifies the perspective of spatial expressions. Despite its significance, FoR has received limited attention in AI models that need spatial intelligence. There is a lack of dedicated benchmarks and in-depth evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in this area. To address this issue, we introduce the Frame of Reference Evaluation in Spatial Reasoning Tasks (FoREST) benchmark, designed to assess FoR comprehension in LLMs. We evaluate LLMs on answering questions that require FoR comprehension and layout generation in text-to-image models using FoREST. Our results reveal a notable performance gap across different FoR classes in various LLMs, affecting their ability to generate accurate layouts for text-to-image generation. This highlights critical shortcomings in FoR comprehension. To improve FoR understanding, we propose Spatial-Guided prompting, which improves LLMs ability to extract essential spatial concepts. Our proposed method improves overall performance across spatial reasoning tasks.

  Deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications requires robust safety guard models to detect and block harmful user prompts. While large safety guard models achieve strong performance, their computational cost is substantial. To mitigate this, smaller distilled models are used, but they often underperform on "hard" examples where the larger model provides accurate predictions. We observe that many inputs can be reliably handled by the smaller model, while only a small fraction require the larger model's capacity. Motivated by this, we propose SafeRoute, a binary router that distinguishes hard examples from easy ones. Our method selectively applies the larger safety guard model to the data that the router considers hard, improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy compared to solely using the larger safety guard model. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our adaptive model selection significantly enhances the trade-off between computational cost and safety performance, outperforming relevant baselines.

  We present ReFoRCE, a Text-to-SQL agent that tops the Spider 2.0 leaderboard--a challenging benchmark reflecting complex, real-world Text-to-SQL scenarios. While Text-to-SQL systems enable natural language queries over structured databases, deploying them in enterprise environments remains difficult due to large, complex schemas (with over 1,000 columns), diverse SQL dialects (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake), and sophisticated query requirements (e.g., transformations and analytics). ReFoRCE addresses these challenges through: (a) database information compression via pattern-based table grouping and LLM-guided schema linking to alleviate long-context issues; (b) self-refinement to iteratively correct syntax and semantic errors across dialects; (c) majority-vote consensus to select high-confidence candidates while deferring ambiguous cases arising from sophisticated queries; and (d) iterative column exploration guided by execution feedback to resolve those deferred cases. ReFoRCE achieves new state-of-the-art results, with scores of 35.83 on Spider 2.0-Snow and 36.56 on Spider 2.0-Lite.

  Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in various fields of society due to their powerful reasoning, understanding, and generation capabilities. However, the security issues associated with these models are becoming increasingly severe. Jailbreaking attacks, as an important method for detecting vulnerabilities in LLMs, have been explored by researchers who attempt to induce these models to generate harmful content through various attack methods. Nevertheless, existing jailbreaking methods face numerous limitations, such as excessive query counts, limited coverage of jailbreak modalities, low attack success rates, and simplistic evaluation methods. To overcome these constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal jailbreaking method: JMLLM. This method integrates multiple strategies to perform comprehensive jailbreak attacks across text, visual, and auditory modalities. Additionally, we contribute a new and comprehensive dataset for multimodal jailbreaking research: TriJail, which includes jailbreak prompts for all three modalities. Experiments on the TriJail dataset and the benchmark dataset AdvBench, conducted on 13 popular LLMs, demonstrate advanced attack success rates and significant reduction in time overhead.

  Numerous studies have assessed the proficiency of AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), in facilitating everyday tasks such as email writing, question answering, and creative content generation. However, researchers face unique challenges and opportunities in leveraging LLMs for their own work, such as brainstorming research ideas, designing experiments, and writing or reviewing papers. In this study, we introduce AAAR-1.0, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate LLM performance in three fundamental, expertise-intensive research tasks: (i) EquationInference, assessing the correctness of equations based on the contextual information in paper submissions; (ii) ExperimentDesign, designing experiments to validate research ideas and solutions; (iii) PaperWeakness, identifying weaknesses in paper submissions; and (iv) REVIEWCRITIQUE, identifying each segment in human reviews is deficient or not. AAAR-1.0 differs from prior benchmarks in two key ways: first, it is explicitly research-oriented, with tasks requiring deep domain expertise; second, it is researcher-oriented, mirroring the primary activities that researchers engage in on a daily basis. An evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LLMs reveals their potential as well as limitations in conducting sophisticated research tasks. We will keep iterating AAAR-1.0 to new versions.

  In the large language model (LLM) revolution, embedding is a key component of various systems, such as retrieving knowledge or memories for LLMs or building content moderation filters. As such cases span from English to other natural or programming languages, from retrieval to classification and beyond, it is advantageous to build a unified embedding model rather than dedicated ones for each scenario. In this context, the pre-trained multilingual decoder-only large language models, e.g., BLOOM, emerge as a viable backbone option. To assess their potential, we propose straightforward strategies for constructing embedders and introduce a universal evaluation benchmark. Experimental results show that our trained model is proficient at generating good embeddings across languages and tasks, even extending to languages and tasks for which no finetuning/pretraining data is available. We also present detailed analyses and additional evaluations. We hope that this work could encourage the development of more robust open-source universal embedders.

  We introduce $\infty$-THOR, a new framework for long-horizon embodied tasks that advances long-context understanding in embodied AI. $\infty$-THOR provides: (1) a generation framework for synthesizing scalable, reproducible, and unlimited long-horizon trajectories; (2) a novel embodied QA task, Needle(s) in the Embodied Haystack, where multiple scattered clues across extended trajectories test agents' long-context reasoning ability; and (3) a long-horizon dataset and benchmark suite featuring complex tasks that span hundreds of environment steps, each paired with ground-truth action sequences. To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions. Our work provides a foundation for the next generation of embodied AI systems capable of robust, long-term reasoning and planning.

  _Sangyong Lee, Subo Hwang, Dohoon Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the 'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a 'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various architectures.

  Existing reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) frequently fail to capture authentic creativity, often rewarding memorization of previously observed patterns. We address this shortcoming with Sudoku-Bench, a curated benchmark of challenging and unconventional Sudoku variants specifically selected to evaluate creative, multi-step logical reasoning. Sudoku variants form an unusually effective domain for reasoning research: each puzzle introduces unique or subtly interacting constraints, making memorization infeasible and requiring solvers to identify novel logical breakthroughs (``break-ins''). Despite their diversity, Sudoku variants maintain a common and compact structure, enabling clear and consistent evaluation. Sudoku-Bench includes a carefully chosen puzzle set, a standardized text-based puzzle representation, and flexible tools compatible with thousands of publicly available puzzles -- making it easy to extend into a general research environment. Baseline experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs solve fewer than 15\% of puzzles unaided, highlighting significant opportunities to advance long-horizon, strategic reasoning capabilities.

  While chains-of-thought (CoT) have advanced complex reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), existing methods remain confined to text or static visual domains, often faltering in dynamic spatial reasoning tasks. To bridge this gap, we present GRASSLAND, a novel maze navigation benchmark designed to evaluate dynamic spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that augmenting textual reasoning chains with dynamic visual drafts, overlaid on input images, significantly outperforms conventional approaches, offering new insights into spatial reasoning in evolving environments. To generalize this capability, we propose D2R (Dynamic Draft-Augmented Reasoning), a training-free framework that seamlessly integrates textual CoT with corresponding visual drafts into MLLMs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that D2R consistently enhances performance across diverse tasks, establishing a robust baseline for dynamic spatial reasoning without requiring model fine-tuning.

  LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) extend the capabilities of single LLMs by enabling cooperation among multiple specialized agents. However, most existing MAS frameworks rely on a single LLM to drive all agents, constraining the system's intelligence to the limit of that model. This paper explores the paradigm of heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS (X-MAS), where agents are powered by diverse LLMs, elevating the system's potential to the collective intelligence of diverse LLMs. We introduce X-MAS-Bench, a comprehensive testbed designed to evaluate the performance of various LLMs across different domains and MAS-related functions. As an extensive empirical study, we assess 27 LLMs across 5 domains (encompassing 21 test sets) and 5 functions, conducting over 1.7 million evaluations to identify optimal model selections for each domain-function combination. Building on these findings, we demonstrate that transitioning from homogeneous to heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS can significantly enhance system performance without requiring structural redesign. Specifically, in a chatbot-only MAS scenario, the heterogeneous configuration yields up to 8.4\% performance improvement on the MATH dataset. In a mixed chatbot-reasoner scenario, the heterogeneous MAS could achieve a remarkable 47\% performance boost on the AIME dataset. Our results underscore the transformative potential of heterogeneous LLMs in MAS, highlighting a promising avenue for advancing scalable, collaborative AI systems.

  While foundation models (FMs), such as diffusion models and large vision-language models (LVLMs), have been widely applied in educational contexts, their ability to generate pedagogically effective visual explanations remains limited. Most existing approaches focus primarily on textual reasoning, overlooking the critical role of structured and interpretable visualizations in supporting conceptual understanding. To better assess the visual reasoning capabilities of FMs in educational settings, we introduce EduVisBench, a multi-domain, multi-level benchmark. EduVisBench features diverse STEM problem sets requiring visually grounded solutions, along with a fine-grained evaluation rubric informed by pedagogical theory. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing models frequently struggle with the inherent challenge of decomposing complex reasoning and translating it into visual representations aligned with human cognitive processes. To address these limitations, we propose EduVisAgent, a multi-agent collaborative framework that coordinates specialized agents for instructional planning, reasoning decomposition, metacognitive prompting, and visualization design. Experimental results show that EduVisAgent substantially outperforms all baselines, achieving a 40.2% improvement and delivering more educationally aligned visualizations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced capabilities in real-world agentic applications. Growing research efforts aim to develop LLM-based agents to address practical demands, introducing a new challenge: agentic scenarios often involve lengthy instructions with complex constraints, such as extended system prompts and detailed tool specifications. While adherence to such instructions is crucial for agentic applications, whether LLMs can reliably follow them remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce AgentIF, the first benchmark for systematically evaluating LLM instruction following ability in agentic scenarios. AgentIF features three key characteristics: (1) Realistic, constructed from 50 real-world agentic applications. (2) Long, averaging 1,723 words with a maximum of 15,630 words. (3) Complex, averaging 11.9 constraints per instruction, covering diverse constraint types, such as tool specifications and condition constraints. To construct AgentIF, we collect 707 human-annotated instructions across 50 agentic tasks from industrial application agents and open-source agentic systems. For each instruction, we annotate the associated constraints and corresponding evaluation metrics, including code-based evaluation, LLM-based evaluation, and hybrid code-LLM evaluation. We use AgentIF to systematically evaluate existing advanced LLMs. We observe that current models generally perform poorly, especially in handling complex constraint structures and tool specifications. We further conduct error analysis and analytical experiments on instruction length and meta constraints, providing some findings about the failure modes of existing LLMs. We have released the code and data to facilitate future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances have demonstrated that integrating reinforcement learning with rule-based rewards can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models, even without supervised fine-tuning. However, prevalent reinforcement learning algorithms such as GRPO and its variants like DAPO, suffer from a coarse granularity issue when computing the advantage. Specifically, they compute rollout-level advantages that assign identical values to every token within a sequence, failing to capture token-specific contributions and hindering effective learning. To address this limitation, we propose Key-token Advantage Estimation (KTAE) - a novel algorithm that estimates fine-grained, token-level advantages without introducing additional models. KTAE leverages the correctness of sampled rollouts and applies statistical analysis to quantify the importance of individual tokens within a sequence to the final outcome. This quantified token-level importance is then combined with the rollout-level advantage to obtain a more fine-grained token-level advantage estimation. Empirical results show that models trained with GRPO+KTAE and DAPO+KTAE outperform baseline methods across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Notably, they achieve higher accuracy with shorter responses and even surpass R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B using the same base model.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When using Large Language Models (LLMs) to support Knowledge Graph Engineering (KGE), one of the first indications when searching for an appropriate model is its size. According to the scaling laws, larger models typically show higher capabilities. However, in practice, resource costs are also an important factor and thus it makes sense to consider the ratio between model performance and costs. The LLM-KG-Bench framework enables the comparison of LLMs in the context of KGE tasks and assesses their capabilities of understanding and producing KGs and KG queries. Based on a dataset created in an LLM-KG-Bench run covering 26 open state-of-the-art LLMs, we explore the model size scaling laws specific to KGE tasks. In our analyses, we assess how benchmark scores evolve between different model size categories. Additionally, we inspect how the general score development of single models and families of models correlates to their size. Our analyses revealed that, with a few exceptions, the model size scaling laws generally also apply to the selected KGE tasks. However, in some cases, plateau or ceiling effects occurred, i.e., the task performance did not change much between a model and the next larger model. In these cases, smaller models could be considered to achieve high cost-effectiveness. Regarding models of the same family, sometimes larger models performed worse than smaller models of the same family. These effects occurred only locally. Hence it is advisable to additionally test the next smallest and largest model of the same family.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the realm of data selection for reasoning tasks, existing approaches predominantly rely on externally predefined static metrics such as difficulty and diversity, which are often designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and lack adaptability to continuous training processes. A critical limitation of these methods is their inability to dynamically align with the evolving capabilities of models during online training, a gap that becomes increasingly pronounced with the rise of dynamic training paradigms and online reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks (e.g., R1 models). To address this, we introduce SAI-DPO, an algorithm that dynamically selects training data by continuously assessing a model's stage-specific reasoning abilities across different training phases. By integrating real-time model performance feedback, SAI-DPO adaptively adapts data selection to the evolving strengths and weaknesses of the model, thus enhancing both data utilization efficiency and final task performance. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art models and eight mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including challenging competition-level datasets (e.g., AIME24 and AMC23), demonstrate that SAI-DPO achieves an average performance boost of up to 21.3 percentage points, with particularly notable improvements of 10 and 15 points on AIME24 and AMC23, respectively. These results highlight the superiority of dynamic, model-adaptive data selection over static, externally defined strategies in advancing reasoning.

  Validating scientific hypotheses is a central challenge in biomedical research, and remains difficult for artificial intelligence (AI) agents due to the complexity of real-world data analysis and evidence interpretation. In this work, we present BioDSA-1K, a benchmark designed to evaluate AI agents on realistic, data-driven biomedical hypothesis validation tasks. BioDSA-1K consists of 1,029 hypothesis-centric tasks paired with 1,177 analysis plans, curated from over 300 published biomedical studies to reflect the structure and reasoning found in authentic research workflows. Each task includes a structured hypothesis derived from the original study's conclusions, expressed in the affirmative to reflect the language of scientific reporting, and one or more pieces of supporting evidence grounded in empirical data tables. While these hypotheses mirror published claims, they remain testable using standard statistical or machine learning methods. The benchmark enables evaluation along four axes: (1) hypothesis decision accuracy, (2) alignment between evidence and conclusion, (3) correctness of the reasoning process, and (4) executability of the AI-generated analysis code. Importantly, BioDSA-1K includes non-verifiable hypotheses: cases where the available data are insufficient to support or refute a claim, reflecting a common yet underexplored scenario in real-world science. We propose BioDSA-1K as a foundation for building and evaluating generalizable, trustworthy AI agents for biomedical discovery.

  As of 2025, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has become a central tool for productivity across industries. Beyond text generation, GenAI now plays a critical role in coding, data analysis, and research workflows. As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, it is essential to assess the reliability and accuracy of their outputs, especially in specialized, high-stakes domains like finance. Most modern LLMs transform text into numerical vectors, which are used in operations such as cosine similarity searches to generate responses. However, this abstraction process can lead to misinterpretation of emotional tone, particularly in nuanced financial contexts. While LLMs generally excel at identifying sentiment in everyday language, these models often struggle with the nuanced, strategically ambiguous language found in earnings call transcripts. Financial disclosures frequently embed sentiment in hedged statements, forward-looking language, and industry-specific jargon, making it difficult even for human analysts to interpret consistently, let alone AI models. This paper presents findings from the Santa Clara Microsoft Practicum Project, led by Professor Charlie Goldenberg, which benchmarks the performance of Microsoft's Copilot, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and traditional machine learning models for sentiment analysis of financial text. Using Microsoft earnings call transcripts, the analysis assesses how well LLM-derived sentiment correlates with market sentiment and stock movements and evaluates the accuracy of model outputs. Prompt engineering techniques are also examined to improve sentiment analysis results. Visualizations of sentiment consistency are developed to evaluate alignment between tone and stock performance, with sentiment trends analyzed across Microsoft's lines of business to determine which segments exert the greatest influence.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are often challenged by generating erroneous or hallucinated responses, especially in complex reasoning tasks. Leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs) as external knowledge sources has emerged as a viable solution. However, existing KG-enhanced methods, either retrieval-based or agent-based, encounter difficulties in accurately retrieving knowledge and efficiently traversing KGs at scale. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, FiDeLiS, designed to improve the factuality of LLM responses by anchoring answers to verifiable reasoning steps retrieved from KGs. To achieve this, we leverage step-wise beam search with a deductive scoring function, allowing the LLM to validate reasoning process step by step, and halt the search once the question is deducible. In addition, we propose a Path-RAG module to pre-select a smaller candidate set for each beam search step, reducing computational costs by narrowing the search space. Extensive experiments show that our method, as a training-free framework, not only improve the performance but also enhance the factuality and interpretability across different benchmarks.

  GUI automation faces critical challenges in dynamic environments. MLLMs suffer from two key issues: misinterpreting UI components and outdated knowledge. Traditional fine-tuning methods are costly for app-specific knowledge updates. We propose GUI-explorer, a training-free GUI agent that incorporates two fundamental mechanisms: (1) Autonomous Exploration of Function-aware Trajectory. To comprehensively cover all application functionalities, we design a Function-aware Task Goal Generator that automatically constructs exploration goals by analyzing GUI structural information (e.g., screenshots and activity hierarchies). This enables systematic exploration to collect diverse trajectories. (2) Unsupervised Mining of Transition-aware Knowledge. To establish precise screen-operation logic, we develop a Transition-aware Knowledge Extractor that extracts effective screen-operation logic through unsupervised analysis the state transition of structured interaction triples (observation, action, outcome). This eliminates the need for human involvement in knowledge extraction. With a task success rate of 53.7% on SPA-Bench and 47.4% on AndroidWorld, GUI-explorer shows significant improvements over SOTA agents. It requires no parameter updates for new apps. GUI-explorer is open-sourced and publicly available atthis https URL.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from passive text generators to active reasoning agents capable of tool interaction, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standardized framework for dynamic tool discovery and orchestration. Despite widespread industry adoption, existing evaluation methodologies fail to adequately assess tool utilization capabilities within this new paradigm. This paper introduces MCP-RADAR, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in the MCP framework through a novel five-dimensional approach measuring: answer accuracy, tool selection efficiency, computational resource efficiency, parameter construction accuracy, and execution speed. Unlike conventional benchmarks that rely on subjective human evaluations or binary success metrics, MCP-RADAR employs objective, quantifiable measurements across multiple task domains including software engineering, mathematical reasoning, and general problem-solving. Our evaluations of leading commercial and open-source LLMs reveal distinctive capability profiles with significant trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and speed, challenging traditional single-metric performance rankings. Besides, we provide valuable guidance for developers to optimize their tools for maximum model compatibility and effectiveness. While focused on MCP due to its standardized approach, our methodology remains applicable across all LLM agent tool integration frameworks, providing valuable insights for both LLM developers and tool creators to optimize the entire LLM-tool interaction ecosystem. The implementation, configurations, and datasets used in our evaluation are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models have achieved remarkable results on a variety of mathematical benchmarks. However, concerns remain as to whether these successes reflect genuine mathematical reasoning or superficial pattern recognition. Common evaluation metrics, such as final answer accuracy, fail to disentangle the underlying competencies involved, offering limited diagnostic value. To address these limitations, we introduce SMART: a Self-Generating and Self-Validating Multi-Dimensional Assessment Framework. SMART decomposes mathematical problem solving into four distinct dimensions: understanding, reasoning, arithmetic, and reflection \& refinement. Each dimension is evaluated independently through tailored tasks, enabling interpretable and fine-grained analysis of LLM behavior. Crucially, SMART integrates an automated self-generating and self-validating mechanism to produce and verify benchmark data, ensuring both scalability and reliability. We apply SMART to 21 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LLMs, uncovering significant discrepancies in their abilities across different dimensions. Our findings demonstrate the inadequacy of final answer accuracy as a sole metric and motivate a new holistic metric to better capture true problem-solving capabilities. Code and benchmarks will be released upon acceptance.

  We present a novel pipeline, ReflectEvo, to demonstrate that small language models (SLMs) can enhance meta introspection through reflection learning. This process iteratively generates self-reflection for self-training, fostering a continuous and self-evolving process. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct ReflectEvo-460k, a large-scale, comprehensive, self-generated reflection dataset with broadened instructions and diverse multi-domain tasks. Building upon this dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of reflection learning to improve SLMs' reasoning abilities using SFT and DPO with remarkable performance, substantially boosting Llama-3 from 52.4% to 71.2% and Mistral from 44.4% to 71.1%. It validates that ReflectEvo can rival or even surpass the reasoning capability of the three prominent open-sourced models on BIG-bench without distillation from superior models or fine-grained human annotation. We further conduct a deeper analysis of the high quality of self-generated reflections and their impact on error localization and correction. Our work highlights the potential of continuously enhancing the reasoning performance of SLMs through iterative reflection learning in the long run.

  Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled unified processing of language, vision, and structured inputs, opening the door to complex tasks such as logical deduction, spatial reasoning, and scientific analysis. Despite their promise, the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, particularly those augmented with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T), remain poorly understood and lack standardized evaluation benchmarks. Existing work focuses primarily on perception or final answer correctness, offering limited insight into how models reason or fail across modalities. To address this gap, we introduce the MMMR, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking. The MMMR comprises 1) a high-difficulty dataset of 1,083 questions spanning six diverse reasoning types with symbolic depth and multi-hop demands and 2) a modular Reasoning Trace Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP) for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy through metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotations. Empirical results show that MLLMs-T overall outperform non-thinking counterparts, but even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5 Pro suffer from reasoning pathologies such as inconsistency and overthinking. This benchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and provides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development. Overall, the MMMR offers a scalable foundation for evaluating, comparing, and improving the next generation of multi-modal reasoning systems.

  _Chaeeun Kim, Seungone Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multi-step reasoning and calling search engines at appropriate steps. However, existing retrieval-augmented reasoning approaches rely on separate retrieval models, limiting the LRM's role in retrieval to deciding when to retrieve and how to query. This separation not only increases hardware and operational costs but also leads to errors in the retrieval process due to the representation bottleneck, a phenomenon where the retriever's embedding space is not expressive enough to meet the generator's requirements. To address this, we shift our perspective from sequence-to-sequence matching to locating the answer-containing paths within the corpus, and propose a novel framework called FREESON (Retriever-FREE Retrieval-Augmented ReaSONing). This framework enables LRMs to retrieve relevant knowledge on their own by acting as both a generator and retriever. To achieve this, we introduce a variant of the MCTS algorithm specialized for the retrieval task, which we call CT-MCTS (Corpus-Traversing Monte Carlo Tree Search). In this algorithm, LRMs traverse through the corpus toward answer-containing regions. Our results on five open-domain QA benchmarks, including single-hop and multi-hop questions, show that FREESON achieves an average improvement of 14.4% in EM and F1 over four multi-step reasoning models with a separate retriever, and it also performs comparably to the strongest baseline, surpassing it by 3% on PopQA and 2WikiMultihopQA.

  The rapid advancement of large language models has unlocked remarkable capabilities across a diverse array of natural language processing tasks. However, the considerable differences among available LLMs-in terms of cost, performance, and computational demands-pose significant challenges for users aiming to identify the most suitable model for specific tasks. In this work, we present LightRouter, a novel framework designed to systematically select and integrate a small subset of LLMs from a larger pool, with the objective of jointly optimizing both task performance and cost efficiency. LightRouter leverages an adaptive selection mechanism to identify models that require only a minimal number of boot tokens, thereby reducing costs, and further employs an effective integration strategy to combine their outputs. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LightRouter matches or outperforms widely-used ensemble baselines, achieving up to a 25% improvement in accuracy. Compared with leading high-performing models, LightRouter achieves comparable performance while reducing inference costs by up to 27%. Importantly, our framework operates without any prior knowledge of individual models and relies exclusively on inexpensive, lightweight models. This work introduces a practical approach for efficient LLM selection and provides valuable insights into optimal strategies for model combination.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of large models has intensified the need for efficient data valuation methods to quantify the contribution of individual data providers. Traditional approaches, such as game-theory-based Shapley value and influence-function-based techniques, face prohibitive computational costs or require access to full data and model training details, making them hardly achieve partial data valuation. To address this, we propose Unlearning Shapley, a novel framework that leverages machine unlearning to estimate data values efficiently. By unlearning target data from a pretrained model and measuring performance shifts on a reachable test set, our method computes Shapley values via Monte Carlo sampling, avoiding retraining and eliminating dependence on full data. Crucially, Unlearning Shapley supports both full and partial data valuation, making it scalable for large models (e.g., LLMs) and practical for data markets. Experiments on benchmark datasets and large-scale text corpora demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational overhead by orders of magnitude. Further analysis confirms a strong correlation between estimated values and the true impact of data subsets, validating its reliability in real-world scenarios. This work bridges the gap between data valuation theory and practical deployment, offering a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for modern AI ecosystems.

  Developing artificial intelligence (AI) for vertical domains requires a solid data foundation for both training and evaluation. In this work, we introduce TrialPanorama, a large-scale, structured database comprising 1,657,476 clinical trial records aggregated from 15 global sources. The database captures key aspects of trial design and execution, including trial setups, interventions, conditions, biomarkers, and outcomes, and links them to standard biomedical ontologies such as DrugBank and MedDRA. This structured and ontology-grounded design enables TrialPanorama to serve as a unified, extensible resource for a wide range of clinical trial tasks, including trial planning, design, and summarization. To demonstrate its utility, we derive a suite of benchmark tasks directly from the TrialPanorama database. The benchmark spans eight tasks across two categories: three for systematic review (study search, study screening, and evidence summarization) and five for trial design (arm design, eligibility criteria, endpoint selection, sample size estimation, and trial completion assessment). The experiments using five state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) show that while general-purpose LLMs exhibit some zero-shot capability, their performance is still inadequate for high-stakes clinical trial workflows. We release TrialPanorama database and the benchmark to facilitate further research on AI for clinical trials.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a novel dataset designed to benchmark the physical and spatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) based on topology optimization, a method for computing optimal material distributions within a design space under prescribed loads and supports. In this dataset, LLMs are provided with conditions such as 2D boundary, applied forces and supports, and must reason about the resulting optimal material distribution. The dataset includes a variety of tasks, ranging from filling in masked regions within partial structures to predicting complete material distributions. Solving these tasks requires understanding the flow of forces and the required material distribution under given constraints, without access to simulation tools or explicit physical models, challenging models to reason about structural stability and spatial organization. Our dataset targets the evaluation of spatial and physical reasoning abilities in 2D settings, offering a complementary perspective to traditional language and logic benchmarks.

  Existing benchmarks fail to capture a crucial aspect of intelligence: physical reasoning, the integrated ability to combine domain knowledge, symbolic reasoning, and understanding of real-world constraints. To address this gap, we introduce PhyX: the first large-scale benchmark designed to assess models capacity for physics-grounded reasoning in visual scenarios. PhyX includes 3K meticulously curated multimodal questions spanning 6 reasoning types across 25 sub-domains and 6 core physics domains: thermodynamics, electromagnetism, mechanics, modern physics, optics, and wave\&acoustics. In our comprehensive evaluation, even state-of-the-art models struggle significantly with physical reasoning. GPT-4o, Claude3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-o4-mini achieve only 32.5\%, 42.2\%, and 45.8\% accuracy respectively-performance gaps exceeding 29\% compared to human experts. Our analysis exposes critical limitations in current models: over-reliance on memorized disciplinary knowledge, excessive dependence on mathematical formulations, and surface-level visual pattern matching rather than genuine physical understanding. We provide in-depth analysis through fine-grained statistics, detailed case studies, and multiple evaluation paradigms to thoroughly examine physical reasoning capabilities. To ensure reproducibility, we implement a compatible evaluation protocol based on widely-used toolkits such as VLMEvalKit, enabling one-click evaluation.

  Algorithms designed for routing problems typically rely on high-quality candidate edges to guide their search, aiming to reduce the search space and enhance the search efficiency. However, many existing algorithms, like the classical Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), often use predetermined candidate edges that remain static throughout local searches. This rigidity could cause the algorithm to get trapped in local optima, limiting its potential to find better solutions. To address this issue, we propose expanding the candidate sets to include other promising edges, providing them an opportunity for selection. Specifically, we incorporate multi-armed bandit models to dynamically select the most suitable candidate edges in each iteration, enabling LKH to make smarter choices and lead to improved solutions. Extensive experiments on multiple TSP benchmarks show the excellent performance of our method. Moreover, we employ this bandit-based method to LKH-3, an extension of LKH tailored for solving various TSP variant problems, and our method also significantly enhances LKH-3's performance across typical TSP variants.

  Query routing, the task to route user queries to different large language model (LLM) endpoints, can be considered as a text classification problem. However, out-of-distribution queries must be handled properly, as those could be questions about unrelated domains, queries in other languages, or even contain unsafe text. Here, we thus study a guarded query routing problem, for which we first introduce the Guarded Query Routing Benchmark (GQR-Bench), which covers three exemplary target domains (law, finance, and healthcare), and seven datasets to test robustness against out-of-distribution queries. We then use GQR-Bench to contrast the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM-based routing mechanisms (GPT-4o-mini, Llama-3.2-3B, and Llama-3.1-8B), standard LLM-based guardrail approaches (LlamaGuard and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails), continuous bag-of-words classifiers (WideMLP, fastText), and traditional machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost). Our results show that WideMLP, enhanced with out-of-domain detection capabilities, yields the best trade-off between accuracy (88%) and speed (<4ms). The embedding-based fastText excels at speed (<1ms) with acceptable accuracy (80%), whereas LLMs yield the highest accuracy (91%) but are comparatively slow (62ms for local Llama-3.1:8B and 669ms for remote GPT-4o-mini calls). Our findings challenge the automatic reliance on LLMs for (guarded) query routing and provide concrete recommendations for practical applications. GQR-Bench will be released as a Python package -- gqr.

  Embodied Question Answering (EQA) has primarily focused on indoor environments, leaving the complexities of urban settings-spanning environment, action, and perception-largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce CityEQA, a new task where an embodied agent answers open-vocabulary questions through active exploration in dynamic city spaces. To support this task, we present CityEQA-EC, the first benchmark dataset featuring 1,412 human-annotated tasks across six categories, grounded in a realistic 3D urban simulator. Moreover, we propose Planner-Manager-Actor (PMA), a novel agent tailored for CityEQA. PMA enables long-horizon planning and hierarchical task execution: the Planner breaks down the question answering into sub-tasks, the Manager maintains an object-centric cognitive map for spatial reasoning during the process control, and the specialized Actors handle navigation, exploration, and collection sub-tasks. Experiments demonstrate that PMA achieves 60.7% of human-level answering accuracy, significantly outperforming competitive baselines. While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights the need for enhanced visual reasoning in CityEQA. This work paves the way for future advancements in urban spatial intelligence.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model collapse, a phenomenon characterized by performance degradation due to iterative training on synthetic data, has been widely studied. However, its implications for bias amplification, the progressive intensification of pre-existing societal biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), remain significantly underexplored, despite the growing influence of LLMs in shaping online discourse. In this paper, we introduce a open, generational, and long-context benchmark specifically designed to measure political bias amplification in LLMs, leveraging sentence continuation tasks derived from a comprehensive dataset of U.S. political news. Our empirical study using GPT-2 reveals consistent and substantial political bias intensification (e.g., right-leaning amplification) over iterative synthetic training cycles. We evaluate three mitigation strategies, Overfitting, Preservation, and Accumulation, and demonstrate that bias amplification persists independently of model collapse, even when the latter is effectively controlled. Furthermore, we propose a mechanistic analysis approach that identifies neurons correlated with specific phenomena during inference through regression and statistical tests. This analysis uncovers largely distinct neuron populations driving bias amplification and model collapse, underscoring fundamentally different underlying mechanisms. Finally, we supplement our empirical findings with theoretical intuition that explains the separate origins of these phenomena, guiding targeted strategies for bias mitigation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a novel prompting approach, Judgment of Thought (JoT), specifically tailored for binary logical reasoning tasks. Despite advances in prompt engineering, existing approaches still face limitations in handling complex logical reasoning tasks. To address these issues, JoT introduces a multi-agent approach with three specialized roles$\unicode{x2010}$$\unicode{x2010}$$\unicode{x2010}$lawyer, prosecutor, and judge$\unicode{x2010}$$\unicode{x2010}$$\unicode{x2010}$where a high-level model acts as the judge, and lower-level models serve as lawyer and prosecutor to systematically debate and evaluate arguments. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks such as BigBenchHard and Winogrande demonstrate JoT's superior performance compared to existing prompting approaches, achieving notable improvements, including 98\% accuracy in Boolean expressions. Also, our ablation studies validate the critical contribution of each role, iterative refinement loops, and feedback mechanisms. Consequently, JoT significantly enhances accuracy, reliability, and consistency in binary reasoning tasks and shows potential for practical applications.
