- **[From Experts to a Generalist: Toward General Whole-Body Control for Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12779)**  `arXiv:2506.12779`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  Achieving general agile whole-body control on humanoid robots remains a major challenge due to diverse motion demands and data conflicts. While existing frameworks excel in training single motion-specific policies, they struggle to generalize across highly varied behaviors due to conflicting control requirements and mismatched data distributions. In this work, we propose BumbleBee (BB), an expert-generalist learning framework that combines motion clustering and sim-to-real adaptation to overcome these challenges. BB first leverages an autoencoder-based clustering method to group behaviorally similar motions using motion features and motion descriptions. Expert policies are then trained within each cluster and refined with real-world data through iterative delta action modeling to bridge the sim-to-real gap. Finally, these experts are distilled into a unified generalist controller that preserves agility and robustness across all motion types. Experiments on two simulations and a real humanoid robot demonstrate that BB achieves state-of-the-art general whole-body control, setting a new benchmark for agile, robust, and generalizable humanoid performance in the real world.

- **[Active Perception for Tactile Sensing: A Task-Agnostic Attention-Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06182)**  `arXiv:2505.06182`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans make extensive use of haptic exploration to map and identify the properties of the objects that we touch. In robotics, active tactile perception has emerged as an important research domain that complements vision for tasks such as object classification, shape reconstruction, and manipulation. This work introduces TAP (Task-agnostic Active Perception) -- a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) and transformer-based architectures to address the challenges posed by partially observable environments. TAP integrates Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and CrossQ algorithms within a unified optimization objective, jointly training a perception module and decision-making policy. By design, TAP is completely task-agnostic and can, in principle, generalize to any active perception problem. We evaluate TAP across diverse tasks, including toy examples and realistic applications involving haptic exploration of 3D models from the Tactile MNIST benchmark. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of TAP, achieving high accuracies on the Tactile MNIST haptic digit recognition task and a tactile pose estimation task. These findings underscore the potential of TAP as a versatile and generalizable framework for advancing active tactile perception in robotics.

  _Sai Srinivas Jeevanandam, Sandeep Inuganti, Shreedhar Govil, Didier Stricker, Jason Rambach_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-based robotic object grasping is typically investigated in the context of isolated objects or unstructured object sets in bin picking scenarios. However, there are several settings, such as construction or warehouse automation, where a robot needs to interact with a structured object formation such as a stack. In this context, we define the problem of selecting suitable objects for grasping along with estimating an accurate 6DoF pose of these objects. To address this problem, we propose a camera-IMU based approach that prioritizes unobstructed objects on the higher layers of stacks and introduce a dataset for benchmarking and evaluation, along with a suitable evaluation metric that combines object selection with pose accuracy. Experimental results show that although our method can perform quite well, this is a challenging problem if a completely error-free solution is needed. Finally, we show results from the deployment of our method for a brick-picking application in a construction scenario.

- **[BiFold: Bimanual Cloth Folding with Language Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16458)**  `arXiv:2501.16458`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`  
  _Oriol Barbany, Adri√† Colom√©, Carme Torras_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cloth folding is a complex task due to the inevitable self-occlusions of clothes, their complicated dynamics, and the disparate materials, geometries, and textures that garments can have. In this work, we learn folding actions conditioned on text commands. Translating high-level, abstract instructions into precise robotic actions requires sophisticated language understanding and manipulation capabilities. To do that, we leverage a pre-trained vision-language model and repurpose it to predict manipulation actions. Our model, BiFold, can take context into account and achieves state-of-the-art performance on an existing language-conditioned folding benchmark. To address the lack of annotated bimanual folding data, we introduce a novel dataset with automatically parsed actions and language-aligned instructions, enabling better learning of text-conditioned manipulation. BiFold attains the best performance on our dataset and demonstrates strong generalization to new instructions, garments, and environments.

- **[Tactile MNIST: Benchmarking Active Tactile Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06361)**  `arXiv:2506.06361`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Tim Schneider, Guillaume Duret, Cristiana de Farias, Roberto Calandra, Liming Chen, Jan Peters_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tactile perception has the potential to significantly enhance dexterous robotic manipulation by providing rich local information that can complement or substitute for other sensory modalities such as vision. However, because tactile sensing is inherently local, it is not well-suited for tasks that require broad spatial awareness or global scene understanding on its own. A human-inspired strategy to address this issue is to consider active perception techniques instead. That is, to actively guide sensors toward regions with more informative or significant features and integrate such information over time in order to understand a scene or complete a task. Both active perception and different methods for tactile sensing have received significant attention recently. Yet, despite advancements, both fields lack standardized benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, an open-source, Gymnasium-compatible benchmark specifically designed for active tactile perception tasks, including localization, classification, and volume estimation. Our benchmark suite offers diverse simulation scenarios, from simple toy environments all the way to complex tactile perception tasks using vision-based tactile sensors. Furthermore, we also offer a comprehensive dataset comprising 13,500 synthetic 3D MNIST digit models and 153,600 real-world tactile samples collected from 600 3D printed digits. Using this dataset, we train a CycleGAN for realistic tactile simulation rendering. By providing standardized protocols and reproducible evaluation frameworks, our benchmark suite facilitates systematic progress in the fields of tactile sensing and active perception.

- **[LeVERB: Humanoid Whole-Body Control with Latent Vision-Language Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13751)**  `arXiv:2506.13751`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Haoru Xue, Xiaoyu Huang, Dantong Niu, Qiayuan Liao, Thomas Kragerud, Jan Tommy Gravdahl, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong semantic understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet most existing systems assume an accurate low-level controller with hand-crafted action "vocabulary" such as end-effector pose or root velocity. This assumption confines prior work to quasi-static tasks and precludes the agile, whole-body behaviors required by humanoid whole-body control (WBC) tasks. To capture this gap in the literature, we start by introducing the first sim-to-real-ready, vision-language, closed-loop benchmark for humanoid WBC, comprising over 150 tasks from 10 categories. We then propose LeVERB: Latent Vision-Language-Encoded Robot Behavior, a hierarchical latent instruction-following framework for humanoid vision-language WBC, the first of its kind. At the top level, a vision-language policy learns a latent action vocabulary from synthetically rendered kinematic demonstrations; at the low level, a reinforcement-learned WBC policy consumes these latent verbs to generate dynamics-level commands. In our benchmark, LeVERB can zero-shot attain a 80% success rate on simple visual navigation tasks, and 58.5% success rate overall, outperforming naive hierarchical whole-body VLA implementation by 7.8 times.

- **[A Spatial Relationship Aware Dataset for Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12525)**  `arXiv:2506.12525`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic task planning in real-world environments requires not only object recognition but also a nuanced understanding of spatial relationships between objects. We present a spatial-relationship-aware dataset of nearly 1,000 robot-acquired indoor images, annotated with object attributes, positions, and detailed spatial relationships. Captured using a Boston Dynamics Spot robot and labelled with a custom annotation tool, the dataset reflects complex scenarios with similar or identical objects and intricate spatial arrangements. We benchmark six state-of-the-art scene-graph generation models on this dataset, analysing their inference speed and relational accuracy. Our results highlight significant differences in model performance and demonstrate that integrating explicit spatial relationships into foundation models, such as ChatGPT 4o, substantially improves their ability to generate executable, spatially-aware plans for robotics. The dataset and annotation tool are publicly available atthis https URL, supporting further research in spatial reasoning for robotics.

- **[DoublyAware: Dual Planning and Policy Awareness for Temporal Difference Learning in Humanoid Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12095)**  `arXiv:2506.12095`  `cs.RO`  
  _Khang Nguyen, An T. Le, Jan Peters, Minh Nhat Vu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Achieving robust robot learning for humanoid locomotion is a fundamental challenge in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), where environmental stochasticity and randomness can hinder efficient exploration and learning stability. The environmental, so-called aleatoric, uncertainty can be amplified in high-dimensional action spaces with complex contact dynamics, and further entangled with epistemic uncertainty in the models during learning phases. In this work, we propose DoublyAware, an uncertainty-aware extension of Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC) that explicitly decomposes uncertainty into two disjoint interpretable components, i.e., planning and policy uncertainties. To handle the planning uncertainty, DoublyAware employs conformal prediction to filter candidate trajectories using quantile-calibrated risk bounds, ensuring statistical consistency and robustness against stochastic dynamics. Meanwhile, policy rollouts are leveraged as structured informative priors to support the learning phase with Group-Relative Policy Constraint (GRPC) optimizers that impose a group-based adaptive trust-region in the latent action space. This principled combination enables the robot agent to prioritize high-confidence, high-reward behavior while maintaining effective, targeted exploration under uncertainty. Evaluated on the HumanoidBench locomotion suite with the Unitree 26-DoF H1-2 humanoid, DoublyAware demonstrates improved sample efficiency, accelerated convergence, and enhanced motion feasibility compared to RL baselines. Our simulation results emphasize the significance of structured uncertainty modeling for data-efficient and reliable decision-making in TD-MPC-based humanoid locomotion learning.

  _Aditya Agarwal, Gaurav Singh, Bipasha Sen, Tom√°s Lozano-P√©rez, Leslie Pack Kaelbling_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Careful robot manipulation in every-day cluttered environments requires an accurate understanding of the 3D scene, in order to grasp and place objects stably and reliably and to avoid colliding with other objects. In general, we must construct such a 3D interpretation of a complex scene based on limited input, such as a single RGB-D image. We describe SceneComplete, a system for constructing a complete, segmented, 3D model of a scene from a single view. SceneComplete is a novel pipeline for composing general-purpose pretrained perception modules (vision-language, segmentation, image-inpainting, image-to-3D, visual-descriptors and pose-estimation) to obtain highly accurate results. We demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness with respect to ground-truth models in a large benchmark dataset and show that its accurate whole-object reconstruction enables robust grasp proposal generation, including for a dexterous hand. We release the code on our websitethis https URL.

- **[Physics-informed Neural Mapping and Motion Planning in Unknown Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09883)**  `arXiv:2410.09883`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yuchen Liu, Ruiqi Ni, Ahmed H. Qureshi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mapping and motion planning are two essential elements of robot intelligence that are interdependent in generating environment maps and navigating around obstacles. The existing mapping methods create maps that require computationally expensive motion planning tools to find a path solution. In this paper, we propose a new mapping feature called arrival time fields, which is a solution to the Eikonal equation. The arrival time fields can directly guide the robot in navigating the given environments. Therefore, this paper introduces a new approach called Active Neural Time Fields (Active NTFields), which is a physics-informed neural framework that actively explores the unknown environment and maps its arrival time field on the fly for robot motion planning. Our method does not require any expert data for learning and uses neural networks to directly solve the Eikonal equation for arrival time field mapping and motion planning. We benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art mapping and motion planning methods and demonstrate its superior performance in both simulated and real-world environments with a differential drive robot and a 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) robot manipulator.

- **[G-Memory: Tracing Hierarchical Memory for Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07398)**  `arXiv:2506.07398`  `cs.MA` `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Guibin Zhang, Muxin Fu, Guancheng Wan, Miao Yu, Kun Wang, Shuicheng Yan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have demonstrated cognitive and execution capabilities that far exceed those of single LLM agents, yet their capacity for self-evolution remains hampered by underdeveloped memory architectures. Upon close inspection, we are alarmed to discover that prevailing MAS memory mechanisms (1) are overly simplistic, completely disregarding the nuanced inter-agent collaboration trajectories, and (2) lack cross-trial and agent-specific customization, in stark contrast to the expressive memory developed for single agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce G-Memory, a hierarchical, agentic memory system for MAS inspired by organizational memory theory, which manages the lengthy MAS interaction via a three-tier graph hierarchy: insight, query, and interaction graphs. Upon receiving a new user query, G-Memory performs bi-directional memory traversal to retrieve both $\textit{high-level, generalizable insights}$ that enable the system to leverage cross-trial knowledge, and $\textit{fine-grained, condensed interaction trajectories}$ that compactly encode prior collaboration experiences. Upon task execution, the entire hierarchy evolves by assimilating new collaborative trajectories, nurturing the progressive evolution of agent teams. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, three LLM backbones, and three popular MAS frameworks demonstrate that G-Memory improves success rates in embodied action and accuracy in knowledge QA by up to $20.89\%$ and $10.12\%$, respectively, without any modifications to the original frameworks.

- **[A Comprehensive Survey on Continual Learning in Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13045)**  `arXiv:2506.13045`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled modern AI systems to comprehend and produce highly sophisticated content, even achieving human-level performance in specific domains. However, these models remain fundamentally constrained by catastrophic forgetting - a persistent challenge where adapting to new tasks typically leads to significant degradation in performance on previously learned tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative models in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative models, including large language models, multimodal large language models, vision language action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, offering deeper insights into the field.

- **[FATE: Focal-modulated Attention Encoder for Multivariate Time-series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11336)**  `arXiv:2408.11336`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Tajamul Ashraf, Janibul Bashir_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Climate change stands as one of the most pressing global challenges of the twenty-first century, with far-reaching consequences such as rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and increasingly extreme weather patterns. Accurate forecasting is critical for monitoring these phenomena and supporting mitigation strategies. While recent data-driven models for time-series forecasting, including CNNs, RNNs, and attention-based transformers, have shown promise, they often struggle with sequential dependencies and limited parallelization, especially in long-horizon, multivariate meteorological datasets. In this work, we present Focal Modulated Attention Encoder (FATE), a novel transformer architecture designed for reliable multivariate time-series forecasting. Unlike conventional models, FATE introduces a tensorized focal modulation mechanism that explicitly captures spatiotemporal correlations in time-series data. We further propose two modulation scores that offer interpretability by highlighting critical environmental features influencing predictions. We benchmark FATE across seven diverse real-world datasets including ETTh1, ETTm2, Traffic, Weather5k, USA-Canada, Europe, and LargeST datasets, and show that it consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art methods, including temperature datasets. Our ablation studies also demonstrate that FATE generalizes well to broader multivariate time-series forecasting tasks. For reproducible research, code is released atthis https URL.

- **[CLImage: Human-Annotated Datasets for Complementary-Label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08295)**  `arXiv:2305.08295`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Hsiu-Hsuan Wang, Tan-Ha Mai, Nai-Xuan Ye, Wei-I Lin, Hsuan-Tien Lin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Complementary-label learning (CLL) is a weakly-supervised learning paradigm that aims to train a multi-class classifier using only complementary labels, which indicate classes to which an instance does not belong. Despite numerous algorithmic proposals for CLL, their practical applicability remains unverified for two reasons. Firstly, these algorithms often rely on assumptions about the generation of complementary labels, and it is not clear how far the assumptions are from reality. Secondly, their evaluation has been limited to synthetically labeled datasets. To gain insights into the real-world performance of CLL algorithms, we developed a protocol to collect complementary labels from human annotators. Our efforts resulted in the creation of four datasets: CLCIFAR10, CLCIFAR20, CLMicroImageNet10, and CLMicroImageNet20, derived from well-known classification datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet200. These datasets represent the very first real-world CLL datasets, namely CLImage, which are publicly available at:this https URL\_Dataset. Through extensive benchmark experiments, we discovered a notable decrease in performance when transitioning from synthetically labeled datasets to real-world datasets. We investigated the key factors contributing to the decrease with a thorough dataset-level ablation study. Our analyses highlight annotation noise as the most influential factor in the real-world datasets. In addition, we discover that the biased-nature of human-annotated complementary labels and the difficulty to validate with only complementary labels are two outstanding barriers to practical CLL. These findings suggest that the community focus more research efforts on developing CLL algorithms and validation schemes that are robust to noisy and biased complementary-label distributions.

- **[LPO: Towards Accurate GUI Agent Interaction via Location Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09373)**  `arXiv:2506.09373`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Jiaqi Tang, Yu Xia, Yi-Feng Wu, Yuwei Hu, Yuhui Chen, Qing-Guo Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advent of autonomous agents is transforming interactions with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) by employing natural language as a powerful intermediary. Despite the predominance of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods in current GUI agents for achieving spatial localization, these methods face substantial challenges due to their limited capacity to accurately perceive positional data. Existing strategies, such as reinforcement learning, often fail to assess positional accuracy effectively, thereby restricting their utility. In response, we introduce Location Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel approach that leverages locational data to optimize interaction preferences. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by focusing on zones rich in information. Besides, it further introduces a dynamic location reward function based on physical distance, reflecting the varying importance of interaction positions. Supported by Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), LPO facilitates an extensive exploration of GUI environments and significantly enhances interaction precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LPO's superior performance, achieving SOTA results across both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations. Our code will be made publicly available soon, atthis https URL.

- **[Flexible-length Text Infilling for Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13579)**  `arXiv:2506.13579`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.CV`  
  _Andrew Zhang, Anushka Sivakumar, Chiawei Tang, Chris Thomas_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discrete diffusion models are a new class of text generators that offer advantages such as bidirectional context use, parallelizable generation, and flexible prompting compared to autoregressive models. However, a critical limitation of discrete diffusion models is their inability to perform flexible-length or flexible-position text infilling without access to ground-truth positional data. We introduce \textbf{DDOT} (\textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport Position Coupling), the first discrete diffusion model to overcome this challenge. DDOT jointly denoises token values and token positions, employing a novel sample-level Optimal Transport (OT) coupling. This coupling preserves relative token ordering while dynamically adjusting the positions and length of infilled segments, a capability previously missing in text diffusion. Our method is orthogonal to existing discrete text diffusion methods and is compatible with various pretrained text denoisers. Extensive experiments on text infilling benchmarks such as One-Billion-Word and Yelp demonstrate that DDOT outperforms naive diffusion baselines. Furthermore, DDOT achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models and enables significant improvements in training efficiency and flexibility.

  _Xudong Zhu, Jiachen Jiang, Mohammad Mahdi Khalili, Zhihui Zhu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-reflection -- the ability of a large language model (LLM) to revisit, evaluate, and revise its own reasoning -- has recently emerged as a powerful behavior enabled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). While self-reflection correlates with improved reasoning accuracy, its origin and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, {\it we first show that self-reflection is not exclusive to RLVR fine-tuned models: it already emerges, albeit rarely, in pretrained models}. To probe this latent ability, we introduce Reflection-Inducing Probing, a method that injects reflection-triggering reasoning traces from fine-tuned models into pretrained models. This intervention raises self-reflection frequency of Qwen2.5 from 0.6\% to 18.6\%, revealing a hidden capacity for reflection. Moreover, our analysis of internal representations shows that both pretrained and fine-tuned models maintain hidden states that distinctly separate self-reflective from non-reflective contexts. Leveraging this observation, {\it we then construct a self-reflection vector, a direction in activation space associated with self-reflective reasoning}. By manipulating this vector, we enable bidirectional control over the self-reflective behavior for both pretrained and fine-tuned models. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that enhancing these vectors improves reasoning performance by up to 12\%, while suppressing them reduces computational cost, providing a flexible mechanism to navigate the trade-off between reasoning quality and efficiency without requiring additional training. Our findings further our understanding of self-reflection and support a growing body of work showing that understanding model internals can enable precise behavioral control.

  _Xun Deng, Han Zhong, Rui Ai, Fuli Feng, Zheng Wang, Xiangnan He_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach for aligning large language models with human preferences. While prior work mainly extends DPO from the aspect of the objective function, we instead improve DPO from the largely overlooked but critical aspect of data selection. Specifically, we address the issue of parameter shrinkage caused by noisy data by proposing a novel margin-maximization principle for dataset curation in DPO training. To further mitigate the noise in different reward models, we propose a Bayesian Aggregation approach that unifies multiple margin sources (external and implicit) into a single preference probability. Extensive experiments in diverse settings demonstrate the consistently high data efficiency of our approach. Remarkably, by using just 10\% of the Ultrafeedback dataset, our approach achieves 3\% to 8\% improvements across various Llama, Mistral, and Qwen models on the AlpacaEval2 benchmark. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly extends to iterative DPO, yielding a roughly 3\% improvement with 25\% online data, revealing the high redundancy in this presumed high-quality data construction manner. These results highlight the potential of data selection strategies for advancing preference optimization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Small language models (SLMs) have attracted considerable attention from both academia and industry due to their broad range of applications in edge devices. To obtain SLMs with strong performance, conventional approaches either pre-train the models from scratch, which incurs substantial computational costs, or compress/prune existing large language models (LLMs), which results in performance drops and falls short in comparison to pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the family of acceleration methods that involve both structured pruning and model training. We found 1) layer-wise adaptive pruning (Adapt-Pruner) is extremely effective in LLMs and yields significant improvements over existing pruning techniques, 2) adaptive pruning equipped with further training leads to models comparable to those pre-training from scratch, 3) incremental pruning brings non-trivial performance gain by interleaving pruning with training and only removing a small portion of neurons ($\sim$5%) at a time. Experimental results on LLaMA-3.1-8B demonstrate that Adapt-Pruner outperforms conventional pruning methods, such as LLM-Pruner, FLAP, and SliceGPT, by an average of 1%-7% in accuracy on commonsense benchmarks. Additionally, Adapt-Pruner restores the performance of MobileLLM-125M to 600M on the MMLU benchmark with 200$\times$ fewer tokens via pruning from its larger counterparts, and discovers a new 1B model that surpasses LLaMA-3.2-1B in multiple benchmarks.

  _Sebastian Bordt, Suraj Srinivas, Valentyn Boreiko, Ulrike von Luxburg_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The leakage of benchmark data into the training data has emerged as a significant challenge for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we challenge the common assumption that small-scale contamination renders benchmark evaluations invalid. First, we experimentally quantify the magnitude of benchmark overfitting based on scaling along three dimensions: The number of model parameters (up to 1.6B), the number of times an example is seen (up to 144), and the number of training tokens (up to 40B). If model and data follow the Chinchilla scaling laws, minor contamination indeed leads to overfitting. At the same time, even 144 times of contamination can be forgotten if the training data is scaled beyond five times Chinchilla, a regime characteristic of many modern LLMs. Continual pre-training of OLMo-7B corroborates these results. Next, we study the impact of the weight decay parameter on example forgetting, showing that empirical forgetting occurs faster than the cumulative weight decay. This allows us to gauge the degree of example forgetting in large-scale training runs, indicating that many LLMs, including Lllama 3 405B, have forgotten the data seen at the beginning of training.

- **[Discrete Diffusion in Large Language and Multimodal Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13759)**  `arXiv:2506.13759`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Runpeng Yu, Qi Li, Xinchao Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs). Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x acceleration in inference speed.The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and dMLLMs research in early 2025.In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains.

  Time-series reasoning remains a significant challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to the dynamic temporal patterns, ambiguous semantics, and lack of temporal priors. In this work, we introduce TimeMaster, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method that enables time-series MLLMs to perform structured, interpretable reasoning directly over visualized time-series inputs and task prompts. TimeMaster adopts a three-part structured output format, reasoning, classification, and domain-specific extension, and is optimized via a composite reward function that aligns format adherence, prediction accuracy, and open-ended insight quality. The model is trained using a two-stage pipeline: we first apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish a good initialization, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) at the token level to enable stable and targeted reward-driven improvement in time-series reasoning. We evaluate TimeMaster on the TimerBed benchmark across six real-world classification tasks based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct. TimeMaster achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both classical time-series models and few-shot GPT-4o by over 14.6% and 7.3% performance gain, respectively. Notably, TimeMaster goes beyond time-series classification: it also exhibits expert-like reasoning behavior, generates context-aware explanations, and delivers domain-aligned insights. Our results highlight that reward-driven RL can be a scalable and promising path toward integrating temporal understanding into time-series MLLMs.

  $E(3)$-equivariant neural networks have demonstrated success across a wide range of 3D modelling tasks. A fundamental operation in these networks is the tensor product, which interacts two geometric features in an equivariant manner to create new features. Due to the high computational complexity of the tensor product, significant effort has been invested to optimize the runtime of this operation. For example, Luo et al. (2024) recently proposed the Gaunt tensor product (GTP) which promises a significant speedup. In this work, we provide a careful, systematic analysis of a number of tensor product operations. In particular, we emphasize that different tensor products are not performing the same operation. The reported speedups typically come at the cost of expressivity. We introduce measures of expressivity and interactability to characterize these differences. In addition, we realized the original implementation of GTP can be greatly simplified by directly using a spherical grid at no cost in asymptotic runtime. This spherical grid approach is faster on our benchmarks and in actual training of the MACE interatomic potential by 30\%. Finally, we provide the first systematic microbenchmarks of the various tensor product operations. We find that the theoretical runtime guarantees can differ wildly from empirical performance, demonstrating the need for careful application-specific benchmarking.

  One of the key challenges that Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces is its limited capability to adapt to a change of data distribution caused by uncertainties. This challenge arises especially in RL systems using deep neural networks as decision makers or policies, which are prone to overfitting after prolonged training on fixed environments. To address this challenge, this paper proposes Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy (GPDP), a new algorithm that integrates diffusion models and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to represent the policy. GPR guides diffusion models to generate actions that maximize learned Q-function, resembling the policy improvement in RL. Furthermore, the kernel-based nature of GPR enhances the policy's exploration efficiency under distribution shifts at test time, increasing the chance of discovering new behaviors and mitigating overfitting. Simulation results on the Walker2d benchmark show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms under distribution shift condition by achieving around 67.74% to 123.18% improvement in the RL's objective function while maintaining comparable performance under normal conditions.

  Geometrical interpretations of deep learning models offer insightful perspectives into their underlying mathematical structures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages differential geometry, particularly concepts from Riemannian geometry, to integrate multiple models into a unified transfer learning framework. By aligning the Ricci curvature of latent space of individual models, we construct an interrelated architecture, namely Geometric Embedding Alignment via cuRvature matching in transfer learning (GEAR), which ensures comprehensive geometric representation across datapoints. This framework enables the effective aggregation of knowledge from diverse sources, thereby improving performance on target tasks. We evaluate our model on 23 molecular task pairs sourced from various domains and demonstrate significant performance gains over existing benchmark model under both random (14.4%) and scaffold (8.3%) data splits.

  We present \textbf{FlowRL}, a novel framework for online reinforcement learning that integrates flow-based policy representation with Wasserstein-2-regularized optimization. We argue that in addition to training signals, enhancing the expressiveness of the policy class is crucial for the performance gains in RL. Flow-based generative models offer such potential, excelling at capturing complex, multimodal action distributions. However, their direct application in online RL is challenging due to a fundamental objective mismatch: standard flow training optimizes for static data imitation, while RL requires value-based policy optimization through a dynamic buffer, leading to difficult optimization landscapes. FlowRL first models policies via a state-dependent velocity field, generating actions through deterministic ODE integration from noise. We derive a constrained policy search objective that jointly maximizes Q through the flow policy while bounding the Wasserstein-2 distance to a behavior-optimal policy implicitly derived from the replay buffer. This formulation effectively aligns the flow optimization with the RL objective, enabling efficient and value-aware policy learning despite the complexity of the policy class. Empirical evaluations on DMControl and Humanoidbench demonstrate that FlowRL achieves competitive performance in online reinforcement learning benchmarks.

  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly embedded in critical decision-making systems, however their foundational ``black-box'' models require eXplainable AI (XAI) solutions to enhance transparency, which are mostly oriented to experts, making no sense to non-experts. Alarming evidence about AI's unprecedented human values risks brings forward the imperative need for transparent human-centered XAI solutions. In this work, we introduce a domain-, model-, explanation-agnostic, generalizable and reproducible framework that ensures both transparency and human-centered explanations tailored to the needs of both experts and non-experts. The framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and employs in-context learning to convey domain- and explainability-relevant contextual knowledge into LLMs. Through its structured prompt and system setting, our framework encapsulates in one response explanations understandable by non-experts and technical information to experts, all grounded in domain and explainability principles. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we establish a ground-truth contextual ``thesaurus'' through a rigorous benchmarking with over 40 data, model, and XAI combinations for an explainable clustering analysis of a well-being scenario. Through a comprehensive quality and human-friendliness evaluation of our framework's explanations, we prove high content quality through strong correlations with ground-truth explanations (Spearman rank correlation=0.92) and improved interpretability and human-friendliness to non-experts through a user study (N=56). Our overall evaluation confirms trust in LLMs as HCXAI enablers, as our framework bridges the above Gaps by delivering (i) high-quality technical explanations aligned with foundational XAI methods and (ii) clear, efficient, and interpretable human-centered explanations for non-experts.

  Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However, since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards. We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model, improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification results.

  Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover closed-form mathematical expressions that accurately describe data, offering interpretability and analytical insight beyond standard black-box models. Existing SR methods often rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling, which struggle with scalability and symbolic consistency. We introduce LIES (Logarithm, Identity, Exponential, Sine), a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable primitive activations that are optimized to model symbolic expressions. We develop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training with an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to promote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it applies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned expressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that the LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae outperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design component through ablation studies.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affects millions worldwide, requiring continuous monitoring to prevent severe hypo- and hyperglycemic events. While continuous glucose monitoring has improved blood glucose management, deploying predictive models on wearable devices remains challenging due to computational and memory constraints. To address this, we propose a novel Lightweight Sequential Transformer model designed for blood glucose prediction in T1D. By integrating the strengths of Transformers' attention mechanisms and the sequential processing of recurrent neural networks, our architecture captures long-term dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. The model is optimized for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices and incorporates a balanced loss function to handle the inherent data imbalance in hypo- and hyperglycemic events. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, OhioT1DM and DiaTrend, demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predicting glucose levels and detecting adverse events. This work fills the gap between high-performance modeling and practical deployment, providing a reliable and efficient T1D management solution.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual Learning (CL) aims to enable models to continuously acquire new knowledge from a sequence of tasks with avoiding the forgetting of learned information. However, existing CL methods only rely on the parameters of the most recent task for inference, which makes them susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. Inspired by the recent success of model merging techniques, we propose \textbf{Perturb-and-Merge (P\&M)}, a novel continual learning framework that integrates model merging into the CL paradigm to mitigate forgetting. Specifically, after training on each task, P\&M constructs a new model by forming a convex combination of the previous model and the newly trained task-specific model. Through theoretical analysis, we minimize the total loss increase across all tasks and derive an analytical solution for the optimal merging coefficient. To further improve the performance of the merged model, we observe that the degradation introduced during merging can be alleviated by a regularization term composed of the task vector and the Hessian matrix of the loss function. Interestingly, we show that this term can be efficiently approximated using second-order symmetric finite differences, and a stochastic perturbation strategy along the task vector direction is accordingly devised which incurs no additional forward or backward passes while providing an effective approximation of the regularization term. Finally, we combine P\&M with LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to reduce memory overhead. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several continual learning benchmark datasets.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in question answering (QA), but metrics for assessing their reliance on memorization versus retrieval remain underdeveloped. Moreover, while finetuned models are state-of-the-art on closed-domain tasks, general-purpose models like GPT-4o exhibit strong zero-shot performance. This raises questions about the trade-offs between memorization, generalization, and retrieval. In this work, we analyze the extent to which multimodal retrieval-augmented VLMs memorize training data compared to baseline VLMs. Using the WebQA benchmark, we contrast finetuned models with baseline VLMs on multihop retrieval and question answering, examining the impact of finetuning on data memorization. To quantify memorization in end-to-end retrieval and QA systems, we propose several proxy metrics by investigating instances where QA succeeds despite retrieval failing. In line with existing work, we find that finetuned models rely more heavily on memorization than retrieval-augmented VLMs, and achieve higher accuracy as a result (72% vs 52% on WebQA test set). Finally, we present the first empirical comparison of the parametric effect between text and visual modalities. Here, we find that image-based questions have parametric response rates that are consistently 15-25% higher than for text-based questions in the WebQA dataset. As such, our measures pose a challenge for future work, both to account for differences in model memorization across different modalities and more generally to reconcile memorization and generalization in joint Retrieval-QA tasks.

  Plasticity loss, a critical challenge in neural network training, limits a model's ability to adapt to new tasks or shifts in data distribution. This paper introduces AID (Activation by Interval-wise Dropout), a novel method inspired by Dropout, designed to address plasticity loss. Unlike Dropout, AID generates subnetworks by applying Dropout with different probabilities on each preactivation interval. Theoretical analysis reveals that AID regularizes the network, promoting behavior analogous to that of deep linear networks, which do not suffer from plasticity loss. We validate the effectiveness of AID in maintaining plasticity across various benchmarks, including continual learning tasks on standard image classification datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet. Furthermore, we show that AID enhances reinforcement learning performance in the Arcade Learning Environment benchmark.

  Clinical trials are pivotal for developing new medical treatments but typically carry risks such as patient mortality and enrollment failure that waste immense efforts spanning over a decade. Applying artificial intelligence (AI) to predict key events in clinical trials holds great potential for providing insights to guide trial designs. However, complex data collection and question definition requiring medical expertise have hindered the involvement of AI thus far. This paper tackles these challenges by presenting a comprehensive suite of 23 meticulously curated AI-ready datasets covering multi-modal input features and 8 crucial prediction challenges in clinical trial design, encompassing prediction of trial duration, patient dropout rate, serious adverse event, mortality rate, trial approval outcome, trial failure reason, drug dose finding, design of eligibility criteria. Furthermore, we provide basic validation methods for each task to ensure the datasets' usability and reliability. We anticipate that the availability of such open-access datasets will catalyze the development of advanced AI approaches for clinical trial design, ultimately advancing clinical trial research and accelerating medical solution development.

  Traffic prediction has long been a focal and pivotal area in research, witnessing both significant strides from city-level to road-level predictions in recent years. With the advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies, autonomous driving, and large-scale models in the traffic domain, lane-level traffic prediction has emerged as an indispensable direction. However, further progress in this field is hindered by the absence of comprehensive and unified evaluation standards, coupled with limited public availability of data and code. In this paper, we present the first systematic classification framework for lane-level traffic prediction, offering a structured taxonomy and analysis of existing methods. We construct three representative datasets from two real-world road networks, covering both regular and irregular lane configurations, and make them publicly available to support future research. We further establishes a unified spatial topology structure and prediction task formulation, and proposes a simple yet effective baseline model, GraphMLP, based on graph structure and MLP networks. This unified framework enables consistent evaluation across datasets and modeling paradigms. We also reproduce previously unavailable code from existing studies and conduct extensive experiments to assess a range of models in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and applicability, providing the first benchmark that jointly considers predictive performance and training cost for lane-level traffic scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human activity intensity prediction is a crucial to many location-based services. Although tremendous progress has been made to model dynamic spatiotemporal patterns of human activity, most existing methods, including spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs), overlook physical constraints of spatial interactions and the over-smoothing phenomenon in spatial correlation modeling. To address these limitations, this work proposes a physics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed Spatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by refining transformer attention to integrate the universal law of gravitation and explicitly incorporating constraints from spatial interactions. Specifically, it (1) estimates two spatially explicit mass parameters based on inflow and outflow, (2) models the likelihood of cross-unit interaction using closed-form solutions of spatial interactions to constrain spatial modeling randomness, and (3) utilizes the learned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon in transformer attention matrices. The underlying law of human activity can be explicitly modeled by the proposed adaptive gravity model. Moreover, a parallel spatiotemporal graph convolution transformer structure is proposed for achieving a balance between coupled spatial and temporal learning. Systematic experiments on six real-world large-scale activity datasets demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, the learned gravity attention matrix can be disentangled and interpreted based on geographical laws. This work provides a novel insight into integrating physical laws with deep learning for spatiotemporal predictive learning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL) typically leverages replay buffers for reusing past experiences during learning. This can help improve sample efficiency when the collected data is informative and aligned with the learning objectives; when that is not the case, it can have the effect of "polluting" the replay buffer with data which can exacerbate optimization challenges in addition to wasting environment interactions due to wasteful sampling. We argue that sampling these uninformative and wasteful transitions can be avoided by addressing the sunk cost fallacy, which, in the context of deep RL, is the tendency towards continuing an episode until termination. To address this, we propose learn to stop (LEAST), a lightweight mechanism that enables strategic early episode termination based on Q-value and gradient statistics, which helps agents recognize when to terminate unproductive episodes early. We demonstrate that our method improves learning efficiency on a variety of RL algorithms, evaluated on both the MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks.

  Human intelligence emerges from the interaction of specialized brain networks, each dedicated to distinct cognitive functions such as language processing, logical reasoning, social understanding, and memory retrieval. Inspired by this biological observation, we introduce the Mixture of Cognitive Reasoners (MiCRo) architecture and training paradigm: a modular transformer-based language model with a training curriculum that encourages the emergence of functional specialization among different modules. Inspired by studies in neuroscience, we partition the layers of a pretrained transformer model into four expert modules, each corresponding to a well-studied cognitive brain network. Our Brain-Like model has three key benefits over the state of the art: First, the specialized experts are highly interpretable and functionally critical, where removing a module significantly impairs performance on domain-relevant benchmarks. Second, our model outperforms comparable baselines that lack specialization on seven reasoning benchmarks. And third, the model's behavior can be steered at inference time by selectively emphasizing certain expert modules (e.g., favoring social over logical reasoning), enabling fine-grained control over the style of its response. Our findings suggest that biologically inspired inductive biases involved in human cognition lead to significant modeling gains in interpretability, performance, and controllability.

  Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity is critical for drug discovery. While recent deep learning approaches have demonstrated promising results, they often rely solely on structural features, overlooking valuable biochemical knowledge associated with binding affinity. To address this limitation, we propose KEPLA, a novel deep learning framework that explicitly integrates prior knowledge from Gene Ontology and ligand properties of proteins and ligands to enhance prediction performance. KEPLA takes protein sequences and ligand molecular graphs as input and optimizes two complementary objectives: (1) aligning global representations with knowledge graph relations to capture domain-specific biochemical insights, and (2) leveraging cross attention between local representations to construct fine-grained joint embeddings for prediction. Experiments on two benchmark datasets across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that KEPLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, interpretability analyses based on knowledge graph relations and cross attention maps provide valuable insights into the underlying predictive mechanisms.

  The pretraining-and-finetuning paradigm has driven significant advances across domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision, with representative pretraining paradigms such as masked language modeling and next-token prediction. However, in molecular representation learning, the task design remains largely limited to node-level denoising, which is effective at modeling local atomic environments, yet maybe insufficient for capturing the global molecular structure required by graph-level property prediction tasks, such as energy estimation and molecular regression. In this work, we present GeoRecon, a novel graph-level pretraining framework that shifts the focus from individual atoms to the molecule as an integrated whole. GeoRecon introduces a graph-level reconstruction task: during pretraining, the model is trained to generate an informative graph representation capable of accurately guiding reconstruction of the molecular geometry. This encourages the model to learn coherent, global structural features rather than isolated atomic details. Without relying on additional supervision or external data, GeoRecon outperforms node-centric baselines on multiple molecular benchmarks (e.g., QM9, MD17), demonstrating the benefit of incorporating graph-level reconstruction for learning more holistic and geometry-aware molecular embeddings.

  Sequential recommender systems aim to model users' evolving preferences by capturing patterns in their historical interactions. Recent advances in this area have leveraged deep neural networks and attention mechanisms to effectively represent sequential behaviors and time-sensitive interests. In this work, we propose C-TLSAN (Content-Enhanced Time-Aware Long- and Short-Term Attention Network), an extension of the TLSAN architecture that jointly models long- and short-term user preferences while incorporating semantic content associated with items, such as product descriptions.C-TLSAN enriches the recommendation pipeline by embedding textual content linked to users' historical interactions directly into both long-term and short-term attention layers. This allows the model to learn from both behavioral patterns and rich item content, enhancing user and item representations across temporal dimensions. By fusing sequential signals with textual semantics, our approach improves the expressiveness and personalization capacity of recommendation systems.We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale Amazon datasets, benchmarking C-TLSAN against state-of-the-art baselines, including recent sequential recommenders based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which represent interaction history and predictions in text form. Empirical results demonstrate that C-TLSAN consistently outperforms strong baselines in next-item prediction tasks. Notably, it improves AUC by 1.66%, Recall@10 by 93.99%, and Precision@10 by 94.80% on average over the best-performing baseline (TLSAN) across 10 Amazon product categories. These results highlight the value of integrating content-aware enhancements into temporal modeling frameworks for sequential recommendation. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across disciplines due to their advanced reasoning and problem solving capabilities. To measure their effectiveness, various benchmarks have been developed that measure aspects of LLM reasoning, comprehension, and problem-solving. While several surveys address LLM evaluation and benchmarks, a domain-specific analysis remains underexplored in the literature. This paper introduces a taxonomy of seven key disciplines, encompassing various domains and application areas where LLMs are extensively utilized. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive review of LLM benchmarks and survey papers within each domain, highlighting the unique capabilities of LLMs and the challenges faced in their application. Finally, we compile and categorize these benchmarks by domain to create an accessible resource for researchers, aiming to pave the way for advancements toward artificial general intelligence (AGI)

  Peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) represent a promising therapeutic avenue for human diseases, particularly in cancer treatment. Systematic elucidation of structure-activity relationships (SARs) and accurate prediction of the activity of PDCs are critical for the rational design and optimization of these conjugates. To this end, we carefully design and construct a benchmark PDCs dataset compiled from literature-derived collections and PDCdb database, and then develop PDCNet, the first unified deep learning framework for forecasting the activity of PDCs. The architecture systematically captures the complex factors underlying anticancer decisions of PDCs in real-word scenarios through a multi-level feature fusion framework that collaboratively characterizes and learns the features of peptides, linkers, and payloads. Leveraging a curated PDCs benchmark dataset, comprehensive evaluation results show that PDCNet demonstrates superior predictive capability, with the highest AUC, F1, MCC and BA scores of 0.9213, 0.7656, 0.7071 and 0.8388 for the test set, outperforming eight established traditional machine learning models. Multi-level validations, including 5-fold cross-validation, threshold testing, ablation studies, model interpretability analysis and external independent testing, further confirm the superiority, robustness, and usability of the PDCNet architecture. We anticipate that PDCNet represents a novel paradigm, incorporating both a benchmark dataset and advanced models, which can accelerate the design and discovery of new PDC-based therapeutic agents.

  Time series forecasting is a critical and practical problem in many real-world applications, especially for industrial scenarios, where load forecasting underpins the intelligent operation of modern systems like clouds, power grids and trafficthis http URL, the inherent complexity and dynamics of these systems present significant challenges. Despite advances in methods such as pattern recognition and anti-non-stationarity have led to performance gains, current methods fail to consistently ensure effectiveness across various system scenarios due to the intertwined issues of complex patterns, concept-drift, and few-shot problems. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel scheme centered on fundamental waveform, a.k.a., meta-pattern. Specifically, we develop a unique Meta-pattern Pooling mechanism to purify and maintain meta-patterns, capturing the nuanced nature of system loads. Complementing this, the proposed Echo mechanism adaptively leverages the meta-patterns, enabling a flexible and precise pattern reconstruction. Our Meta-pattern Echo transformer (MetaEformer) seamlessly incorporates these mechanisms with the transformer-based predictor, offering end-to-end efficiency and interpretability of core processes. Demonstrating superior performance across eight benchmarks under three system scenarios, MetaEformer marks a significant advantage in accuracy, with a 37% relative improvement on fifteen state-of-the-art baselines.

  Dynamic link prediction remains a central challenge in temporal graph learning, particularly in designing models that are both effective and practical for real-world deployment. Existing approaches often rely on complex neural architectures, which are computationally intensive and difficult to interpret.In this work, we build on the strong recurrence-based foundation of the EdgeBank baseline, by supplementing it with inductive capabilities. We do so by leveraging the predictive power of non-learnable signals from two complementary perspectives: historical edge recurrence, as captured by EdgeBank, and global node popularity, as introduced in the PopTrack model. We propose t-CoMem, a lightweight memory module that tracks temporal co-occurrence patterns and neighborhood activity. Building on this, we introduce Base3, an interpolation-based model that fuses EdgeBank, PopTrack, and t-CoMem into a unified scoring framework. This combination effectively bridges local and global temporal dynamics -- repetition, popularity, and context -- without relying on training. Evaluated on the Temporal Graph Benchmark, Base3 achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art deep models, even outperforming them on some datasets. Importantly, it considerably improves on existing baselines' performance under more realistic and challenging negative sampling strategies -- offering a simple yet robust alternative for temporal graph learning.

  Many real-world physics and engineering problems arise in geometrically complex domains discretized by meshes for numerical simulations. The nodes of these potentially irregular meshes naturally form point clouds whose limited tractability poses significant challenges for learning mappings via machine learning models. To address this, we introduce a novel and parameter-free encoding scheme that aggregates footprints of points onto grid vertices and yields information-rich grid representations of the topology. Such structured representations are well-suited for standard convolution and FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) operations and enable efficient learning of mappings between encoded input-output pairs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, we integrate our encoder with a uniquely designed UNet (E-UNet) and benchmark its performance against Fourier- and transformer-based models across diverse 2D and 3D problems where we analyze the performance in terms of predictive accuracy, data efficiency, and noise robustness. Furthermore, we highlight the versatility of our encoding scheme in various mapping tasks including recovering full point cloud responses from partial observations. Our proposed framework offers a practical alternative to both primitive and computationally intensive encoding schemes; supporting broad adoption in computational science applications involving mesh-based simulations.

  We present Sparse Interpolated Mixture-of-Experts (SIMoE) instruction-tuning, an end-to-end algorithm designed to fine-tune a dense pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) into a MoE-style model that possesses capabilities in multiple specialized domains. During instruction-tuning, SIMoE automatically identifies multiple specialized experts under a specified sparsity constraint, with each expert representing a structurally sparse subset of the seed LLM's parameters that correspond to domain-specific knowledge within the data. SIMoE simultaneously learns an input-dependent expert merging strategy via a router network, leveraging rich cross-expert knowledge for superior downstream generalization that surpasses existing baselines. Empirically, SIMoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on common instruction-tuning benchmarks while maintaining an optimal performance-compute trade-off compared to all baselines.

  Recent work has questioned the reliability of graph learning benchmarks, citing concerns around task design, methodological rigor, and data suitability. In this extended abstract, we contribute to this discussion by focusing on evaluation strategies in Temporal Link Prediction (TLP). We observe that current evaluation protocols are often affected by one or more of the following issues: (1) inconsistent sampled metrics, (2) reliance on hard negative sampling often introduced as a means to improve robustness, and (3) metrics that implicitly assume equal base probabilities across source nodes by combining predictions. We support these claims through illustrative examples and connections to longstanding concerns in the recommender systems community. Our ongoing work aims to systematically characterize these problems and explore alternatives that can lead to more robust and interpretable evaluation. We conclude with a discussion of potential directions for improving the reliability of TLP benchmarks.

  Developing improved predictive models for multi-molecular systems is crucial, as nearly every chemical product used results from a mixture of chemicals. While being a vital part of the industry pipeline, the chemical mixture space remains relatively unexplored by the Machine Learning community. In this paper, we introduce CheMixHub, a holistic benchmark for molecular mixtures, covering a corpus of 11 chemical mixtures property prediction tasks, from drug delivery formulations to battery electrolytes, totalling approximately 500k data points gathered and curated from 7 publicly available datasets. CheMixHub introduces various data splitting techniques to assess context-specific generalization and model robustness, providing a foundation for the development of predictive models for chemical mixture properties. Furthermore, we map out the modelling space of deep learning models for chemical mixtures, establishing initial benchmarks for the community.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) is a promising approach to train a unified model capable of solving multiple Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants. However, existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based multi-task methods can only train light decoder models on small-scale problems, exhibiting limited generalization ability when solving large-scale problems. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel multi-task learning method driven by knowledge distillation (MTL-KD), which enables the efficient training of heavy decoder models with strong generalization ability. The proposed MTL-KD method transfers policy knowledge from multiple distinct RL-based single-task models to a single heavy decoder model, facilitating label-free training and effectively improving the model's generalization ability across diverse tasks. In addition, we introduce a flexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C), which is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the performance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10 unseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method consistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities.

  Model merging provides a scalable alternative to multi-task training by combining specialized finetuned models through parameter arithmetic, enabling efficient deployment without the need for joint training or access to all task data. While recent methods have shown promise, existing evaluations are limited in both model scale and task diversity, leaving open questions about their applicability to large, domain-specialized LLMs. To tackle the challenges, we introduce MergeBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess model merging at scale. MergeBench builds on state-of-the-art open-source language models, including Llama and Gemma families at 2B to 9B scales, and covers five key domains: instruction following, mathematics, multilingual understanding, coding and safety. We standardize finetuning and evaluation protocols, and assess eight representative merging methods across multi-task performance, forgetting and runtime efficiency. Based on extensive experiments, we provide practical guidelines for algorithm selection and share insights showing that model merging tends to perform better on stronger base models, with techniques such as merging coefficient tuning and sparsification improving knowledge retention. However, several challenges remain, including the computational cost on large models, the gap for in-domain performance compared to multi-task models, and the underexplored role of model merging in standard LLM training pipelines. We hope MergeBench provides a foundation for future research to advance the understanding and practical application of model merging. Our project page is at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

  We introduce AegisLLM, a cooperative multi-agent defense against adversarial attacks and information leakage. In AegisLLM, a structured workflow of autonomous agents - orchestrator, deflector, responder, and evaluator - collaborate to ensure safe and compliant LLM outputs, while self-improving over time through prompt optimization. We show that scaling agentic reasoning system at test-time - both by incorporating additional agent roles and by leveraging automated prompt optimization (such as DSPy)- substantially enhances robustness without compromising model utility. This test-time defense enables real-time adaptability to evolving attacks, without requiring model retraining. Comprehensive evaluations across key threat scenarios, including unlearning and jailbreaking, demonstrate the effectiveness of AegisLLM. On the WMDP unlearning benchmark, AegisLLM achieves near-perfect unlearning with only 20 training examples and fewer than 300 LM calls. For jailbreaking benchmarks, we achieve 51% improvement compared to the base model on StrongReject, with false refusal rates of only 7.9% on PHTest compared to 18-55% for comparable methods. Our results highlight the advantages of adaptive, agentic reasoning over static defenses, establishing AegisLLM as a strong runtime alternative to traditional approaches based on model modifications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In safety-critical applications, guaranteeing the satisfaction of constraints over continuous environments is crucial, e.g., an autonomous agent should never crash into obstacles or go off-road. Neural models struggle in the presence of these constraints, especially when they involve intricate algebraic relationships. To address this, we introduce a differentiable probabilistic layer that guarantees the satisfaction of non-convex algebraic constraints over continuous variables. This probabilistic algebraic layer (PAL) can be seamlessly plugged into any neural architecture and trained via maximum likelihood without requiring approximations. PAL defines a distribution over conjunctions and disjunctions of linear inequalities, parameterized by polynomials. This formulation enables efficient and exact renormalization via symbolic integration, which can be amortized across different data points and easily parallelized on a GPU. We showcase PAL and our integration scheme on a number of benchmarks for algebraic constraint integration and on real-world trajectory data.

  Divergence-free symmetric tensors (DFSTs) are fundamental in continuum mechanics, encoding conservation laws such as mass and momentum conservation. We introduce Riemann Tensor Neural Networks (RTNNs), a novel neural architecture that inherently satisfies the DFST condition to machine precision, providing a strong inductive bias for enforcing these conservation laws. We prove that RTNNs can approximate any sufficiently smooth DFST with arbitrary precision and demonstrate their effectiveness as surrogates for conservative PDEs, achieving improved accuracy across benchmarks. This work is the first to use DFSTs as an inductive bias in neural PDE surrogates and to explicitly enforce the conservation of both mass and momentum within a physics-constrained neural architecture.

  Continual learning (CL) has been a critical topic in contemporary deep neural network applications, where higher levels of both forward and backward transfer are desirable for an effective CL performance. Existing CL strategies primarily focus on task models, either by regularizing model updates or by separating task-specific and shared components, while often overlooking the potential of leveraging inter-task relationships to enhance transfer. To address this gap, we propose a transferability-aware task embedding, termed H-embedding, and construct a hypernet framework under its guidance to learn task-conditioned model weights for CL tasks. Specifically, H-embedding is derived from an information theoretic measure of transferability and is designed to be online and easy to compute. Our method is also characterized by notable practicality, requiring only the storage of a low-dimensional task embedding per task and supporting efficient end-to-end training. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and DomainNet show that our framework performs prominently compared to various baseline and SOTA approaches, demonstrating strong potential in capturing and utilizing intrinsic task relationships.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  World models represent a promising approach for training reinforcement learning agents with significantly improved sample efficiency. While most world model methods primarily rely on sequences of discrete latent variables to model environment dynamics, this compression often neglects critical visual details essential for reinforcement learning. Recent diffusion-based world models condition generation on a fixed context length of frames to predict the next observation, using separate recurrent neural networks to model rewards and termination signals. Although this architecture effectively enhances visual fidelity, the fixed context length approach inherently limits memory capacity. In this paper, we introduce EDELINE, a unified world model architecture that integrates state space models with diffusion models. Our approach outperforms existing baselines across visually challenging Atari 100k tasks, memory-demanding Crafter benchmark, and 3D first-person ViZDoom environments, demonstrating superior performance in all these diverse challenges.

  As language models (LMs) approach human-level performance, a comprehensive understanding of their behavior becomes crucial. This includes evaluating capabilities, biases, task performance, and alignment with societal values. Extensive initial evaluations, including red teaming and diverse benchmarking, can establish a model's behavioral profile. However, subsequent fine-tuning or deployment modifications may alter these behaviors in unintended ways. We present a method for continual Behavioral Shift Auditing (BSA) in LMs. Building on recent work in hypothesis testing, our auditing test detects behavioral shifts solely through model generations. Our test compares model generations from a baseline model to those of the model under scrutiny and provides theoretical guarantees for change detection while controlling false positives. The test features a configurable tolerance parameter that adjusts sensitivity to behavioral changes for different use cases. We evaluate our approach using two case studies: monitoring changes in (a) toxicity and (b) translation performance. We find that the test is able to detect meaningful changes in behavior distributions using just hundreds of examples.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have gained prominence for their ability to scale neural networks, particularly transformers, without a proportional increase in computational cost. Despite their success, their role in compositional generalization, i.e., adapting to novel combinations of known components, remains under-explored. This study challenges the assumption that minimal expert activation suffices for task generalization and investigates the relationship between task complexity and optimal sparsity in SMoE models. Through empirical evaluations on the SRAVEN symbolic reasoning task and the SKILL-MIX benchmark, we demonstrate that (i) the number of activated experts consistently increases with the perceived task difficulty to maintain performance; and (ii) the optimal number of activated experts scales proportionally with task complexity. Our theoretical analysis derives a scaling law for optimal sparsity by balancing approximation and estimation errors, revealing alignment with empirical observations. We formally show that the optimal sparsity lies between minimal activation (1-2 experts) and full activation, with the exact number scaling proportionally to task complexity and further influenced by the size of the training data and the complexity of the model. These findings offer practical insights for designing SMoE models that achieve computational efficiency while enabling robust compositional generalization.

  In Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) agents are tasked with optimising decision-making behaviours that trade-off between multiple, possibly conflicting, objectives. MORL based on decomposition is a family of solution methods that employ a number of utility functions to decompose the multi-objective problem into individual single-objective problems solved simultaneously in order to approximate a Pareto front of policies. We focus on the case of linear utility functions parametrised by weight vectors w. We introduce a method based on Upper Confidence Bound to efficiently search for the most promising weight vectors during different stages of the learning process, with the aim of maximising the hypervolume of the resulting Pareto front. The proposed method demonstrates consistency and strong performance across various MORL baselines on Mujoco benchmark problems. The code is released in:this https URL

  Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) must remain accurate under extreme viewpoint, scale and illumination variations. The widely adopted ORB-SLAM3 falters in these regimes because it relies on hand-crafted ORB keypoints. We introduce SuperPoint-SLAM3, a drop-in upgrade that (i) replaces ORB with the self-supervised SuperPoint detector--descriptor, (ii) enforces spatially uniform keypoints via adaptive non-maximal suppression (ANMS), and (iii) integrates a lightweight NetVLAD place-recognition head for learning-based loop closure.On the KITTI Odometry benchmark SuperPoint-SLAM3 reduces mean translational error from 4.15% to 0.34% and mean rotational error from 0.0027 deg/m to 0.0010 deg/m. On the EuRoC MAV dataset it roughly halves both errors across every sequence (e.g., V2\_03: 1.58% -> 0.79%). These gains confirm that fusing modern deep features with a learned loop-closure module markedly improves ORB-SLAM3 accuracy while preserving its real-time operation.Implementation, pretrained weights and reproducibility scripts are available atthis https URL.

  Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency. Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization (ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our code and relevant data as open-source atthis https URL.

  We introduce the Lecture Video Visual Objects (LVVO) dataset, a new benchmark for visual object detection in educational video content. The dataset consists of 4,000 frames extracted from 245 lecture videos spanning biology, computer science, and geosciences. A subset of 1,000 frames, referred to as LVVO_1k, has been manually annotated with bounding boxes for four visual categories: Table, Chart-Graph, Photographic-image, and Visual-illustration. Each frame was labeled independently by two annotators, resulting in an inter-annotator F1 score of 83.41%, indicating strong agreement. To ensure high-quality consensus annotations, a third expert reviewed and resolved all cases of disagreement through a conflict resolution process. To expand the dataset, a semi-supervised approach was employed to automatically annotate the remaining 3,000 frames, forming LVVO_3k. The complete dataset offers a valuable resource for developing and evaluating both supervised and semi-supervised methods for visual content detection in educational videos. The LVVO dataset is publicly available to support further research in this domain.

  We introduce the task of Audible Action Temporal Localization, which aims to identify the spatio-temporal coordinates of audible movements. Unlike conventional tasks such as action recognition and temporal action localization, which broadly analyze video content, our task focuses on the distinct kinematic dynamics of audible actions. It is based on the premise that key actions are driven by inflectional movements; for example, collisions that produce sound often involve abrupt changes in motion. To capture this, we propose $TA^{2}Net$, a novel architecture that estimates inflectional flow using the second derivative of motion to determine collision timings without relying on audio input. $TA^{2}Net$ also integrates a self-supervised spatial localization strategy during training, combining contrastive learning with spatial analysis. This dual design improves temporal localization accuracy and simultaneously identifies sound sources within video frames. To support this task, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, $Audible623$, derived from Kinetics and UCF101 by removing non-essential vocalization subsets. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach on $Audible623$ and show strong generalizability to other domains, such as repetitive counting and sound source localization.

  The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered sophisticated reasoning capabilities into the realm of video through Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). However, VideoLLMs currently rely on a single vision encoder for all of their visual processing, which limits the amount and type of visual information that can be conveyed to the LLM. Our method, MERV, Multi-Encoder Representation of Videos, instead leverages multiple frozen visual encoders to create a unified representation of a video, providing the VideoLLM with a comprehensive set of specialized visual knowledge. Spatio-temporally aligning the features from each encoder allows us to tackle a wider range of open-ended and multiple-choice video understanding questions and outperform prior state-of-the-art works. MERV is up to 3.7% better in accuracy than Video-LLaVA across the standard suite video understanding benchmarks, while also having a better Video-ChatGPT score. We also improve upon SeViLA, the previous best on zero-shot Perception Test accuracy, by 2.2%. MERV introduces minimal extra parameters and trains faster than equivalent single-encoder methods while parallelizing the visual processing. Finally, we provide qualitative evidence that MERV successfully captures domain knowledge from each of its encoders. Our results offer promising directions in utilizing multiple vision encoders for comprehensive video understanding.

  We study multi-modal summarization for instructional videos, whose goal is to provide users an efficient way to learn skills in the form of text instructions and key video frames. We observe that existing benchmarks focus on generic semantic-level video summarization, and are not suitable for providing step-by-step executable instructions and illustrations, both of which are crucial for instructional videos. We propose a novel benchmark for user interface (UI) instructional video summarization to fill the gap. We collect a dataset of 2,413 UI instructional videos, which spans over 167 hours. These videos are manually annotated for video segmentation, text summarization, and video summarization, which enable the comprehensive evaluations for concise and executable video summarization. We conduct extensive experiments on our collected MS4UI dataset, which suggest that state-of-the-art multi-modal summarization methods struggle on UI video summarization, and highlight the importance of new methods for UI instructional video summarization.

  With the burgeoning growth of online video platforms and the escalating volume of video content, the demand for proficient video understanding tools has intensified markedly. Given the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in language and multimodal tasks, this survey provides a detailed overview of recent advancements in video understanding that harness the power of LLMs (Vid-LLMs). The emergent capabilities of Vid-LLMs are surprisingly advanced, particularly their ability for open-ended multi-granularity (general, temporal, and spatiotemporal) reasoning combined with commonsense knowledge, suggesting a promising path for future video understanding. We examine the unique characteristics and capabilities of Vid-LLMs, categorizing the approaches into three main types: Video Analyzer x LLM, Video Embedder x LLM, and (Analyzer + Embedder) x LLM. Furthermore, we identify five sub-types based on the functions of LLMs in Vid-LLMs: LLM as Summarizer, LLM as Manager, LLM as Text Decoder, LLM as Regressor, and LLM as Hidden Layer. Furthermore, this survey presents a comprehensive study of the tasks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for Vid-LLMs. Additionally, it explores the expansive applications of Vid-LLMs across various domains, highlighting their remarkable scalability and versatility in real-world video understanding challenges. Finally, it summarizes the limitations of existing Vid-LLMs and outlines directions for future research. For more information, readers are recommended to visit the repository atthis https URL.

  Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter previously unseen object classes. However, most existing LiDAR panoptic segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale. Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level. To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR panoptic segmentation methods.

  Small object detection in UAV imagery is crucial for applications such as search-and-rescue, traffic monitoring, and environmental surveillance, but it is hampered by tiny object size, low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited feature extraction. Existing multi-scale fusion methods help, but add computational burden and blur fine details, making small object detection in cluttered scenes difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified fusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost detection performance while maintaining efficiency. MGDFIS comprises three synergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries token-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight spectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration Module, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and parallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and the Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps to rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen responses to true object regions. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone benchmark demonstrate that MGDFIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse backbone architectures and detection frameworks, achieving superior precision and recall with low inference time. By striking an optimal balance between accuracy and resource usage, MGDFIS provides a practical solution for small-object detection on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we upgrade the multi-head attention mechanism, the core of the Transformer model, to improve efficiency while maintaining or surpassing the previous accuracy level. We show that multi-head attention can be expressed in the summation form. Drawing on the insight that not all attention heads hold equal significance, we propose Mixture-of-Head attention (MoH), a new architecture that treats attention heads as experts in the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism. MoH has two significant advantages: First, MoH enables each token to select the appropriate attention heads, enhancing inference efficiency without compromising accuracy or increasing the number of parameters. Second, MoH replaces the standard summation in multi-head attention with a weighted summation, introducing flexibility to the attention mechanism and unlocking extra performance potential. Extensive experiments on ViT, DiT, and LLMs demonstrate that MoH outperforms multi-head attention by using only 50%-90% of the attention heads. Moreover, we demonstrate that pre-trained multi-head attention models, such as LLaMA3-8B, can be further continue-tuned into our MoH models. Notably, MoH-LLaMA3-8B achieves an average accuracy of 64.0% across 14 benchmarks, outperforming LLaMA3-8B by 2.4% by utilizing only 75% of the attention heads. We believe the proposed MoH is a promising alternative to multi-head attention and provides a strong foundation for developing advanced and efficient attention-based models.

  Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Codes and data will be available later (under review).Keywords: reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), instruction following, complex instructions

  In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process, enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar, +7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

  Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench. Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

  We introduce Ego-R1, a novel framework for reasoning over ultra-long (i.e., in days and weeks) egocentric videos, which leverages a structured Chain-of-Tool-Thought (CoTT) process, orchestrated by an Ego-R1 Agent trained via reinforcement learning (RL). Inspired by human problem-solving strategies, CoTT decomposes complex reasoning into modular steps, with the RL agent invoking specific tools, one per step, to iteratively and collaboratively answer sub-questions tackling such tasks as temporal retrieval and multi-modal understanding. We design a two-stage training paradigm involving supervised finetuning (SFT) of a pretrained language model using CoTT data and RL to enable our agent to dynamically propose step-by-step tools for long-range reasoning. To facilitate training, we construct a dataset called Ego-R1 Data, which consists of Ego-CoTT-25K for SFT and Ego-QA-4.4K for RL. Furthermore, our Ego-R1 agent is evaluated on a newly curated week-long video QA benchmark, Ego-R1 Bench, which contains human-verified QA pairs from hybrid sources. Extensive results demonstrate that the dynamic, tool-augmented chain-of-thought reasoning by our Ego-R1 Agent can effectively tackle the unique challenges of understanding ultra-long egocentric videos, significantly extending the time coverage from few hours to a week.

  Model editing aims to efficiently update a pre-trained model's knowledge without the need for time-consuming full retraining. While existing pioneering editing methods achieve promising results, they primarily focus on editing single-modal language models (LLMs). However, for vision-language models (VLMs), which involve multiple modalities, the role and impact of each modality on editing performance remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we explore the impact of textual and visual modalities on model editing and find that: (1) textual and visual representations reach peak sensitivity at different layers, reflecting their varying importance; and (2) editing both modalities can efficiently update knowledge, but this comes at the cost of compromising the model's original capabilities. Based on our findings, we propose DualEdit, an editor that modifies both textual and visual modalities at their respective key layers. Additionally, we introduce a gating module within the more sensitive textual modality, allowing DualEdit to efficiently update new knowledge while preserving the model's original information. We evaluate DualEdit across multiple VLM backbones and benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art VLM editing baselines as well as adapted LLM editing methods on different evaluation metrics.

  Owing to its rapid progress and broad application prospects, few-shot action recognition has attracted considerable interest. However, current methods are predominantly based on limited single-modal data, which does not fully exploit the potential of multimodal information. This paper presents a novel framework that actively identifies reliable modalities for each sample using task-specific contextual cues, thus significantly improving recognition performance. Our framework integrates an Active Sample Inference (ASI) module, which utilizes active inference to predict reliable modalities based on posterior distributions and subsequently organizes them accordingly. Unlike reinforcement learning, active inference replaces rewards with evidence-based preferences, making more stable predictions. Additionally, we introduce an active mutual distillation module that enhances the representation learning of less reliable modalities by transferring knowledge from more reliable ones. Adaptive multimodal inference is employed during the meta-test to assign higher weights to reliable modalities. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Blind Super-Resolution (blind SR) aims to enhance the model's generalization ability with unknown degradation, yet it still encounters severe overfitting issues. Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances generalization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind SR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before the final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at intermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at intermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized feature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying dropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which we attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it introduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method for blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates application across intermediate layers of networks. Specifically, for training-testing inconsistency, we re-design the form of dropout and integrate the features before and after dropout adaptively. For inconsistency in generalization requirements across different layers, we innovatively design an adaptive training strategy to strengthen feature propagation by layer-wise annealing. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all past regularization methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, also highly effective in other image restoration tasks.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding relationships between visual and textual data through joint embedding spaces. Despite their effectiveness, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality, posing significant security concerns. Building upon our previous work on Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), which introduced learnable text prompts to enhance adversarial robustness in VLMs without extensive parameter training, we present a significant extension by introducing the Neural Augmentor framework for Multi-modal Adversarial Prompt Tuning (NAP-Tuning).Our key innovations include: (1) extending AdvPT from text-only to multi-modal prompting across both text and visual modalities, (2) expanding from single-layer to multi-layer prompt architectures, and (3) proposing a novel architecture-level redesign through our Neural Augmentor approach, which implements feature purification to directly address the distortions introduced by adversarial attacks in feature space. Our NAP-Tuning approach incorporates token refiners that learn to reconstruct purified features through residual connections, allowing for modality-specific and layer-specific featurethis http URLexperiments demonstrate that NAP-Tuning significantly outperforms existing methods across various datasets and attack types. Notably, our approach shows significant improvements over the strongest baselines under the challenging AutoAttack benchmark, outperforming them by 33.5% on ViT-B16 and 33.0% on ViT-B32 architectures while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The concept bottleneck model (CBM), as a technique improving interpretability via linking predictions to human-understandable concepts, makes high-risk and life-critical medical image classification credible. Typically, existing CBM methods associate the final layer of visual encoders with concepts to explain the model's predictions. However, we empirically discover the phenomenon of concept preference variation, that is, the concepts are preferably associated with the features at different layers than those only at the final layer; yet a blind last-layer-based association neglects such a preference variation and thus weakens the accurate correspondences between features and concepts, impairing model interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-layer Visual Preference-enhanced Concept Bottleneck Model (MVP-CBM), which comprises two key novel modules: (1) intra-layer concept preference modeling, which captures the preferred association of different concepts with features at various visual layers, and (2) multi-layer concept sparse activation fusion, which sparsely aggregates concept activations from multiple layers to enhance performance. Thus, by explicitly modeling concept preferences, MVP-CBM can comprehensively leverage multi-layer visual information to provide a more nuanced and accurate explanation of model decisions. Extensive experiments on several public medical classification benchmarks demonstrate that MVP-CBM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and interoperability, verifying its superiority.

  The advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods has significantly reduced the computational burden of adapting large-scale pretrained models to diverse downstream tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle to achieve robust performance under domain shifts while maintaining computational efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose Low-rAnk Regulated Gradient Projection (LARGO) algorithm that integrates dynamic constraints into low-rank adaptation methods. Specifically, LARGO incorporates parallel trainable gradient projections to dynamically regulate layer-wise updates, retaining the Out-Of-Distribution robustness of pretrained model while preserving inter-layer independence. Additionally, it ensures computational efficiency by mitigating the influence of gradient dependencies across layers during weight updates. Besides, through leveraging singular value decomposition of pretrained weights for structured initialization, we incorporate an SVD-based initialization strategy that minimizing deviation from pretrained knowledge. Through extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks, LARGO achieves state-of-the-art performance across in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios, demonstrating improved robustness under domain shifts with significantly lower computational overhead compared to existing PEFT methods. The source code will be released soon.

  Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, making early detection and accurate treatment response monitoring critical priorities. We present BreastDCEDL, a curated, deep learning-ready dataset comprising pre-treatment 3D Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans from 2,070 breast cancer patients drawn from the I-SPY1, I-SPY2, and Duke cohorts, all sourced from The Cancer Imaging Archive. The raw DICOM imaging data were rigorously converted into standardized 3D NIfTI volumes with preserved signal integrity, accompanied by unified tumor annotations and harmonized clinical metadata including pathologic complete response (pCR), hormone receptor (HR), and HER2 status. Although DCE-MRI provides essential diagnostic information and deep learning offers tremendous potential for analyzing such complex data, progress has been limited by lack of accessible, public, multicenter datasets. BreastDCEDL addresses this gap by enabling development of advanced models, including state-of-the-art transformer architectures that require substantial training data. To demonstrate its capacity for robust modeling, we developed the first transformer-based model for breast DCE-MRI, leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture trained on RGB-fused images from three contrast phases (pre-contrast, early post-contrast, and late post-contrast). Our ViT model achieved state-of-the-art pCR prediction performance in HR+/HER2- patients (AUC 0.94, accuracy 0.93). BreastDCEDL includes predefined benchmark splits, offering a framework for reproducible research and enabling clinically meaningful modeling in breast cancer imaging.

  We introduce an attention-based method that uses learned binary attention masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence the prediction. Context can strongly affect object perception, sometimes leading to biased representations, particularly when objects appear in out-of-distribution backgrounds. At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require identifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this conundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image to discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2 leverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these regions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious information. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage 1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves robustness against spurious correlations and out-of-distribution backgrounds. Code:this https URL

  Surgical video understanding is pivotal for enabling automated intraoperative decision-making, skill assessment, and postoperative quality improvement. However, progress in developing surgical video foundation models (FMs) remains hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for pretraining and systematic evaluation. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{SurgBench}, a unified surgical video benchmarking framework comprising a pretraining dataset, \textbf{SurgBench-P}, and an evaluation benchmark, \textbf{SurgBench-E}. SurgBench offers extensive coverage of diverse surgical scenarios, with SurgBench-P encompassing 53 million frames across 22 surgical procedures and 11 specialties, and SurgBench-E providing robust evaluation across six categories (phase classification, camera motion, tool recognition, disease diagnosis, action classification, and organ detection) spanning 72 fine-grained tasks. Extensive experiments reveal that existing video FMs struggle to generalize across varied surgical video analysis tasks, whereas pretraining on SurgBench-P yields substantial performance improvements and superior cross-domain generalization to unseen procedures and modalities.

  Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in audio-visual understanding, yet they struggle with real-world scenarios that require complex reasoning across extensive video collections. Existing benchmarks for video question answering remain limited in scope, typically involving one clip per query, which falls short of representing the challenges of large-scale, audio-visual retrieval and reasoning encountered in practical applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task named AV-HaystacksQA, where the goal is to identify salient segments across different videos in response to a query and link them together to generate the most informative answer. To this end, we present AVHaystacks, an audio-visual benchmark comprising 3100 annotated QA pairs designed to assess the capabilities of LMMs in multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding task. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic, multi-agent framework MAGNET to address this challenge, achieving up to 89% and 65% relative improvements over baseline methods on BLEU@4 and GPT evaluation scores in QA task on our proposed AVHaystacks. To enable robust evaluation of multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding for optimal response generation, we introduce two new metrics, STEM, which captures alignment errors between a ground truth and a predicted step sequence and MTGS, to facilitate balanced and interpretable evaluation of segment-level grounding performance.

  Real-world objects are composed of distinctive, object-specific parts. Identifying these parts is key to performing fine-grained, compositional reasoning-yet, large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle to perform this seemingly straightforward task. In this work, we introduce PARTONOMY, an LMM benchmark designed for pixel-level part grounding. We construct PARTONOMY from existing part datasets and our own rigorously annotated set of images, encompassing 862 part labels and 534 object labels for evaluation. Unlike existing datasets that simply ask models to identify generic parts, PARTONOMY uses specialized concepts (e.g., agricultural airplane), and challenges models to compare objects' parts, consider part-whole relationships, and justify textual predictions with visual segmentations. Our experiments demonstrate significant limitations in state-of-the-art LMMs (e.g., LISA-13B achieves only 5.9% gIoU), highlighting a critical gap in their part grounding abilities. We note that existing segmentation-enabled LMMs (segmenting LMMs) have two key architectural shortcomings: they use special [SEG] tokens not seen during pretraining which induce distribution shift, and they discard predicted segmentations instead of using past predictions to guide future ones. To address these deficiencies, we train several part-centric LMMs and propose PLUM, a novel segmenting LMM that uses span tagging instead of segmentation tokens and that conditions on prior predictions in a feedback loop. We find that pretrained PLUM outperforms existing segmenting LMMs on reasoning segmentation, VQA, and visual hallucination benchmarks. In addition, PLUM finetuned on our proposed Explanatory Part Segmentation task is competitive with segmenting LMMs trained on significantly more segmentation data. Our work opens up new avenues towards enabling fine-grained, grounded visual understanding in LMMs.

  Depth Anything has achieved remarkable success in monocular depth estimation with strong generalization ability. However, it suffers from temporal inconsistency in videos, hindering its practical applications. Various methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue by leveraging video generation models or introducing priors from optical flow and camera poses. Nonetheless, these methods are only applicable to short videos (< 10 seconds) and require a trade-off between quality and computational efficiency. We propose Video Depth Anything for high-quality, consistent depth estimation in super-long videos (over several minutes) without sacrificing efficiency. We base our model on Depth Anything V2 and replace its head with an efficient spatial-temporal head. We design a straightforward yet effective temporal consistency loss by constraining the temporal depth gradient, eliminating the need for additional geometric priors. The model is trained on a joint dataset of video depth and unlabeled images, similar to Depth Anything V2. Moreover, a novel key-frame-based strategy is developed for long video inference. Experiments show that our model can be applied to arbitrarily long videos without compromising quality, consistency, or generalization ability. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot video depth estimation. We offer models of different scales to support a range of scenarios, with our smallest model capable of real-time performance at 30 FPS.

  Neuromorphic cameras, also known as event cameras, are asynchronous brightness-change sensors that can capture extremely fast motion without suffering from motion blur, making them particularly promising for 3D reconstruction in extreme environments. However, existing research on 3D reconstruction using monocular neuromorphic cameras is limited, and most of the methods rely on estimating physical priors and employ complex multi-step pipelines. In this work, we propose an end-to-end method for dense voxel 3D reconstruction using neuromorphic cameras that eliminates the need to estimate physical priors. Our method incorporates a novel event representation to enhance edge features, enabling the proposed feature-enhancement model to learn more effectively. Additionally, we introduced Optimal Binarization Threshold Selection Principle as a guideline for future related work, using the optimal reconstruction results achieved with threshold optimization as the benchmark. Our method achieves a 54.6% improvement in reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline method.

  By contextualizing the kernel as global as possible, Modern ConvNets have shown great potential in computer vision tasks. However, recent progress on multi-order game-theoretic interaction within deep neural networks (DNNs) reveals the representation bottleneck of modern ConvNets, where the expressive interactions have not been effectively encoded with the increased kernel size. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new family of modern ConvNets, dubbed MogaNet, for discriminative visual representation learning in pure ConvNet-based models with favorable complexity-performance trade-offs. MogaNet encapsulates conceptually simple yet effective convolutions and gated aggregation into a compact module, where discriminative features are efficiently gathered and contextualized adaptively. MogaNet exhibits great scalability, impressive efficiency of parameters, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art ViTs and ConvNets on ImageNet and various downstream vision benchmarks, including COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation, 2D&3D human pose estimation, and video prediction. Notably, MogaNet hits 80.0% and 87.8% accuracy with 5.2M and 181M parameters on ImageNet-1K, outperforming ParC-Net and ConvNeXt-L, while saving 59% FLOPs and 17M parameters, respectively.

  Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging world knowledge and reasoning capabilities. However, current VLA models often struggle with physically infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions. We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking (trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning). To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Qualitative results showcase the adaptive reasoning and accurate planning capabilities of AutoVLA in diverse scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transductive zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to classify unseen categories by leveraging both semantic class descriptions and the distribution of unlabeled test data. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel at aligning visual inputs with textual semantics, they often rely too heavily on class-level priors and fail to capture fine-grained visual cues. In contrast, Vision-only Foundation Models (VFMs) like DINOv2 provide rich perceptual features but lack semantic alignment. To exploit the complementary strengths of these models, we propose OTFusion, a simple yet effective training-free framework that bridges VLMs and VFMs via Optimal Transport. Specifically, OTFusion aims to learn a shared probabilistic representation that aligns visual and semantic information by minimizing the transport cost between their respective distributions. This unified distribution enables coherent class predictions that are both semantically meaningful and visually grounded. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that OTFusion consistently outperforms the original CLIP model, achieving an average accuracy improvement of nearly $10\%$, all without any fine-tuning or additional annotations. The code will be publicly released after the paper is accepted.

  Distilling pre-trained 2D diffusion models into 3D assets has driven remarkable advances in text-to-3D synthesis. However, existing methods typically rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss, which involves asymmetric KL divergence--a formulation that inherently favors mode-seeking behavior and limits generation diversity. In this paper, we introduce Dive3D, a novel text-to-3D generation framework that replaces KL-based objectives with Score Implicit Matching (SIM) loss, a score-based objective that effectively mitigates mode collapse. Furthermore, Dive3D integrates both diffusion distillation and reward-guided optimization under a unified divergence perspective. Such reformulation, together with SIM loss, yields significantly more diverse 3D outputs while improving text alignment, human preference, and overall visual fidelity. We validate Dive3D across various 2D-to-3D prompts and find that it consistently outperforms prior methods in qualitative assessments, including diversity, photorealism, and aesthetic appeal. We further evaluate its performance on the GPTEval3D benchmark, comparing against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Dive3D also achieves strong results on quantitative metrics, including text-asset alignment, 3D plausibility, text-geometry consistency, texture quality, and geometric detail.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with long videos due to fixed context windows and weak long-term dependency modeling. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for videos use static retrieval strategies, leading to inefficiencies for simple queries and information loss for complex tasks. To address this, we propose AdaVideoRAG, a novel framework that dynamically adapts retrieval granularity based on query complexity using a lightweight intent classifier. Our framework employs an Omni-Knowledge Indexing module to build hierarchical databases from text (captions, ASR, OCR), visual features, and semantic graphs, enabling optimal resource allocation across tasks. We also introduce the HiVU benchmark for comprehensive evaluation. Experiments demonstrate improved efficiency and accuracy for long-video understanding, with seamless integration into existing MLLMs. AdaVideoRAG establishes a new paradigm for adaptive retrieval in video analysis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose an efficient framework to compress multiple video-frame features before feeding them into large multimodal models, thereby mitigating the severe token explosion arising from long or dense videos. Our design leverages a bidirectional state-space-based block equipped with a gated skip connection and a learnable weighted-average pooling mechanism applied to periodically inserted learned queries. This structure enables hierarchical downsampling across both spatial and temporal dimensions, preserving performance in a cost-effective manner. Across challenging long and dense video understanding tasks, our approach demonstrates competitive results against state-of-the-art models, while significantly reducing overall token budget. Notably, replacing our proposed state-space block with a conventional Transformer results in substantial performance degradation, highlighting the advantages of state-space modeling for effectively compressing multi-frame video data. Our framework emphasizes resource-conscious efficiency, making it practical for real-world deployments. We validate its scalability and generality across multiple benchmarks, achieving the dual objectives of efficient resource usage and comprehensive video understanding.

  Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a core task in computer vision that involves detecting objects in video frames and associating them across time. The rise of deep learning has significantly advanced MOT, particularly within the tracking-by-detection paradigm, which remains the dominant approach. Advancements in modern deep learning-based methods accelerated in 2022 with the introduction of ByteTrack for tracking-by-detection and MOTR for end-to-end tracking. Our survey provides an in-depth analysis of deep learning-based MOT methods, systematically categorizing tracking-by-detection approaches into five groups: joint detection and embedding, heuristic-based, motion-based, affinity learning, and offline methods. In addition, we examine end-to-end tracking methods and compare them with existing alternative approaches. We evaluate the performance of recent trackers across multiple benchmarks and specifically assess their generality by comparing results across different domains. Our findings indicate that heuristic-based methods achieve state-of-the-art results on densely populated datasets with linear object motion, while deep learning-based association methods, in both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end approaches, excel in scenarios with complex motion patterns.

  Grapevine varieties are essential for the economies of many wine-producing countries, influencing the production of wine, juice, and the consumption of fruits and leaves. Traditional identification methods, such as ampelography and molecular analysis, have limitations: ampelography depends on expert knowledge and is inherently subjective, while molecular methods are costly and time-intensive. To address these limitations, recent studies have applied deep learning (DL) models to classify grapevine varieties using image data. However, due to the small dataset sizes, these methods often depend on transfer learning from datasets from other domains, e.g., ImageNet1K (IN1K), which can lead to performance degradation due to domain shift and supervision collapse. In this context, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods can be a good tool to avoid this performance degradation, since they can learn directly from data, without external labels. This study presents an evaluation of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) for identifying grapevine varieties based on field-acquired images. The main contributions of this study include two benchmarks comprising 43 grapevine varieties collected across different seasons, an analysis of MAE's application in the agricultural context, and a performance comparison of trained models across seasons. Our results show that a ViT-B/16 model pre-trained with MAE and the unlabeled dataset achieved an F1 score of 0.7956, outperforming all other models. Additionally, we observed that pre-trained models benefit from long pre-training, perform well under low-data training regime, and that simple data augmentation methods are more effective than complex ones. The study also found that the mask ratio in MAE impacts performance only marginally.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Point cloud registration (PCR) is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision and robotics. Most existing learning-based PCR methods rely on Transformers, which suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This limitation restricts the resolution of point clouds that can be processed, inevitably leading to information loss. In contrast, Mamba-a recently proposed model based on state space models (SSMs)-achieves linear computational complexity while maintaining strong long-range contextual modeling capabilities. However, directly applying Mamba to PCR tasks yields suboptimal performance due to the unordered and irregular nature of point cloud data. To address this challenge, we propose MT-PCR, the first point cloud registration framework that integrates both Mamba and Transformer modules. Specifically, we serialize point cloud features using Z-order space-filling curves to enforce spatial locality, enabling Mamba to better model the geometric structure of the input. Additionally, we remove the order indicator module commonly used in Mamba-based sequence modeling, leads to improved performance in our setting. The serialized features are then processed by an optimized Mamba encoder, followed by a Transformer refinement stage. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MT-PCR outperforms Transformer-based and concurrent state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency, significantly reducing while GPU memory usage and FLOPs.

  Prototype-based reconstruction methods for unsupervised anomaly detection utilize a limited set of learnable prototypes which only aggregates insufficient normal information, resulting in undesirable reconstruction. However, increasing the number of prototypes may lead to anomalies being well reconstructed through the attention mechanism, which we refer to as the "Soft Identity Mapping" problem. In this paper, we propose Pro-AD to address these issues and fully utilize the prototypes to boost the performance of anomaly detection. Specifically, we first introduce an expanded set of learnable prototypes to provide sufficient capacity for semantic information. Then we employ a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder which integrates the process of the normal information aggregation and the target feature reconstruction via prototypes, with the aim of allowing the prototypes to aggregate more comprehensive normal semantic information from different levels of the image features and the target feature reconstruction to not only utilize its contextual information but also dynamically leverage the learned comprehensive prototypes. Additionally, to prevent the anomalies from being well reconstructed using sufficient semantic information through the attention mechanism, Pro-AD introduces a Prototype-based Constraint that applied within the target feature reconstruction process of the decoder, which further improves the performance of our approach. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our Pro-AD achieve state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its superior robustness and practical effectiveness for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection task.

  Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) is tasked with pinpointing temporal intervals containing anomalous events within untrimmed videos, utilizing only video-level annotations. However, a significant challenge arises due to the absence of dense frame-level annotations, often leading to incomplete localization in existing WS-VAD methods. To address this issue, we present a novel LEC-VAD, Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection, which features a dual structure designed to encode both category-aware and category-agnostic semantics between vision and language. Within LEC-VAD, we devise semantic regularities that leverage an anomaly-aware Gaussian mixture to learn precise event boundaries, thereby yielding more complete event instances. Besides, we develop a novel memory bank-based prototype learning mechanism to enrich concise text descriptions associated with anomaly-event categories. This innovation bolsters the text's expressiveness, which is crucial for advancing WS-VAD. Our LEC-VAD demonstrates remarkable advancements over the current state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets XD-Violence and UCF-Crime.

  Video Individual Counting (VIC) is a recently introduced task that aims to estimate pedestrian flux from a video. It extends conventional Video Crowd Counting (VCC) beyond the per-frame pedestrian count. In contrast to VCC that only learns to count repeated pedestrian patterns across frames, the key problem of VIC is how to identify co-existent pedestrians between frames, which turns out to be a correspondence problem. Existing VIC approaches, however, mainly follow a one-to-one (O2O) matching strategy where the same pedestrian must be exactly matched between frames, leading to sensitivity to appearance variations or missing detections. In this work, we show that the O2O matching could be relaxed to a one-to-many (O2M) matching problem, which better fits the problem nature of VIC and can leverage the social grouping behavior of walking pedestrians. We therefore introduce OMAN, a simple but effective VIC model with implicit One-to-Many mAtchiNg, featuring an implicit context generator and a one-to-many pairwise matcher. Experiments on the SenseCrowd and CroHD benchmarks show that OMAN achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at \href{this https URL}{OMAN}.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present MAMMA, a markerless motion-capture pipeline that accurately recovers SMPL-X parameters from multi-view video of two-person interaction sequences. Traditional motion-capture systems rely on physical markers. Although they offer high accuracy, their requirements of specialized hardware, manual marker placement, and extensive post-processing make them costly and time-consuming. Recent learning-based methods attempt to overcome these limitations, but most are designed for single-person capture, rely on sparse keypoints, or struggle with occlusions and physical interactions. In this work, we introduce a method that predicts dense 2D surface landmarks conditioned on segmentation masks, enabling person-specific correspondence estimation even under heavy occlusion. We employ a novel architecture that exploits learnable queries for each landmark. We demonstrate that our approach can handle complex person--person interaction and offers greater accuracy than existing methods. To train our network, we construct a large, synthetic multi-view dataset combining human motions from diverse sources, including extreme poses, hand motions, and close interactions. Our dataset yields high-variability synthetic sequences with rich body contact and occlusion, and includes SMPL-X ground-truth annotations with dense 2D landmarks. The result is a system capable of capturing human motion without the need for markers. Our approach offers competitive reconstruction quality compared to commercial marker-based motion-capture solutions, without the extensive manual cleanup. Finally, we address the absence of common benchmarks for dense-landmark prediction and markerless motion capture by introducing two evaluation settings built from real multi-view sequences. We will release our dataset, benchmark, method, training code, and pre-trained model weights for research purposes.

  Video anomaly detection (VAD) is essential for enhancing safety and security by identifying unusual events across different environments. Existing VAD benchmarks, however, are primarily designed for general-purpose scenarios, neglecting the specific characteristics of smart home applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce SmartHome-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating VAD in smart home scenarios, focusing on the capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Our newly proposed benchmark consists of 1,203 videos recorded by smart home cameras, organized according to a novel anomaly taxonomy that includes seven categories, such as Wildlife, Senior Care, and Baby Monitoring. Each video is meticulously annotated with anomaly tags, detailed descriptions, and reasoning. We further investigate adaptation methods for MLLMs in VAD, assessing state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source models with various prompting techniques. Results reveal significant limitations in the current models' ability to detect video anomalies accurately. To address these limitations, we introduce the Taxonomy-Driven Reflective LLM Chain (TRLC), a new LLM chaining framework that achieves a notable 11.62% improvement in detection accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose an adaptive sampling framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that leverages comprehensive multi-view photometric error signals within a unified Metropolis-Hastings approach. Traditional 3DGS methods heavily rely on heuristic-based density-control mechanisms (e.g., cloning, splitting, and pruning), which can lead to redundant computations or the premature removal of beneficial Gaussians. Our framework overcomes these limitations by reformulating densification and pruning as a probabilistic sampling process, dynamically inserting and relocating Gaussians based on aggregated multi-view errors and opacity scores. Guided by Bayesian acceptance tests derived from these error-based importance scores, our method substantially reduces reliance on heuristics, offers greater flexibility, and adaptively infers Gaussian distributions without requiring predefined scene complexity. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep Blending, show that our approach reduces the number of Gaussians needed, enhancing computational efficiency while matching or modestly surpassing the view-synthesis quality of state-of-the-art models.

  In medical visual question answering (Med-VQA), achieving accurate responses relies on three critical steps: precise perception of medical imaging data, logical reasoning grounded in visual input and textual questions, and coherent answer derivation from the reasoning process. Recent advances in general vision-language models (VLMs) show that large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) could significantly enhance both reasoning capabilities and overall model performance. However, their application in medical domains is hindered by two fundamental challenges: 1) misalignment between perceptual understanding and reasoning stages, and 2) inconsistency between reasoning pathways and answer generation, both compounded by the scarcity of high-quality medical datasets for effective large-scale RL. In this paper, we first introduce Med-Zero-17K, a curated dataset for pure RL-based training, encompassing over 30 medical image modalities and 24 clinical tasks. Moreover, we propose a novel large-scale RL framework for Med-VLMs, Consistency-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which integrates rewards to ensure fidelity between perception and reasoning, consistency in reasoning-to-answer derivation, and rule-based accuracy for final responses. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method over strong VLM baselines, showcasing strong generalization capability to 3D Med-VQA benchmarks and R1-like training paradigms.

  Text-driven image editing has achieved remarkable success in following single instructions. However, real-world scenarios often involve complex, multi-step instructions, particularly ``chain'' instructions where operations are interdependent. Current models struggle with these intricate directives, and existing benchmarks inadequately evaluate such capabilities. Specifically, they often overlook multi-instruction and chain-instruction complexities, and common consistency metrics are flawed. To address this, we introduce ComplexBench-Edit, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess model performance on complex, multi-instruction, and chain-dependent image editing tasks. ComplexBench-Edit also features a new vision consistency evaluation method that accurately assesses non-modified regions by excluding edited areas. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet powerful Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based approach that significantly enhances the ability of existing models to follow complex instructions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate ComplexBench-Edit's efficacy in differentiating model capabilities and highlight the superior performance of our CoT-based method in handling complex edits.

  Overfitting to synthetic training pairs remains a critical challenge in image dehazing, leading to poor generalization capability to real-world scenarios. To address this issue, existing approaches utilize unpaired realistic data for training, employing CycleGAN or contrastive learning frameworks. Despite their progress, these methods often suffer from training instability, resulting in limited dehazing performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training strategy for unpaired image dehazing, termed Rehazy, to improve both dehazing performance and training stability. This strategy explores the consistency of the underlying clean images across hazy images and utilizes hazy-rehazy pairs for effective learning of real haze characteristics. To favorably construct hazy-rehazy pairs, we develop a physics-based rehazy generation pipeline, which is theoretically validated to reliably produce high-quality rehazy images. Additionally, leveraging the rehazy strategy, we introduce a dual-branch framework for dehazing network training, where a clean branch provides a basic dehazing capability in a synthetic manner, and a hazy branch enhances the generalization ability with hazy-rehazy pairs. Moreover, we design a new dehazing network within these branches to improve the efficiency, which progressively restores clean scenes from coarse to fine. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach, exceeding the previous state-of-the-art methods by 3.58 dB on the SOTS-Indoor dataset and by 1.85 dB on the SOTS-Outdoor dataset in PSNR. Our code will be publicly available.

  Single-view textured human reconstruction aims to reconstruct a clothed 3D digital human by inputting a monocular 2D image. Existing approaches include feed-forward methods, limited by scarce 3D human data, and diffusion-based methods, prone to erroneous 2D hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose a novel SMPL normal map Equipped 3D Human Reconstruction (SEHR) framework, integrating a pretrained large 3D reconstruction model with human geometry prior. SEHR performs single-view human reconstruction without using a preset diffusion model in one forward propagation. Concretely, SEHR consists of two key components: SMPL Normal Map Guidance (SNMG) and SMPL Normal Map Constraint (SNMC). SNMG incorporates SMPL normal maps into an auxiliary network to provide improved body shape guidance. SNMC enhances invisible body parts by constraining the model to predict an extra SMPL normal Gaussians.

  The Deep Learning Visual Space Simulation System (DLVS3) introduces a novel synthetic dataset generator and a simulation pipeline specifically designed for training and testing satellite pose estimation solutions. This work introduces the DLVS3-HST-V1 dataset, which focuses on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as a complex, articulated target. The dataset is generated using advanced real-time and offline rendering technologies, integrating high-fidelity 3D models, dynamic lighting (including secondary sources like Earth reflection), and physically accurate material properties. The pipeline supports the creation of large-scale, richly annotated image sets with ground-truth 6-DoF pose and keypoint data, semantic segmentation, depth, and normal maps. This enables the training and benchmarking of deep learning-based pose estimation solutions under realistic, diverse, and challenging visual conditions. The paper details the dataset generation process, the simulation architecture, and the integration with deep learning frameworks, and positions DLVS3 as a significant step toward closing the domain gap for autonomous spacecraft operations in proximity and servicing missions.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face significant challenges when dealing with the diverse resolutions and aspect ratios of real-world images, as most existing models rely on fixed, low-resolution inputs. While recent studies have explored integrating native resolution visual encoding to improve model performance, such efforts remain fragmented and lack a systematic framework within the open-source community. Moreover, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating VLMs under varied visual conditions, often neglecting resolution as a critical factor. To address the "Resolution Dilemma" stemming from both model design and benchmark limitations, we introduce RC-Bench, a novel benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate VLM capabilities under extreme visual conditions, with an emphasis on resolution and aspect ratio variations. In conjunction, we propose NativeRes-LLaVA, an open-source training framework that empowers VLMs to effectively process images at their native resolutions and aspect ratios. Based on RC-Bench and NativeRes-LLaVA, we conduct comprehensive experiments on existing visual encoding strategies. The results show that Native Resolution Visual Encoding significantly improves the performance of VLMs on RC-Bench as well as other resolution-centric benchmarks. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Infrared small target (IRST) detection is challenging in simultaneously achieving precise, universal, robust and efficient performance due to extremely dim targets and strong interference. Current learning-based methods attempt to leverage ``more" information from both the spatial and the short-term temporal domains, but suffer from unreliable performance under complex conditions while incurring computational redundancy. In this paper, we explore the ``more essential" information from a more crucial domain for the detection. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal that the global temporal saliency and correlation information in the temporal profile demonstrate significant superiority in distinguishing target signals from other signals. To investigate whether such superiority is preferentially leveraged by well-trained networks, we built the first prediction attribution tool in this field and verified the importance of the temporal profile information. Inspired by the above conclusions, we remodel the IRST detection task as a one-dimensional signal anomaly detection task, and propose an efficient deep temporal probe network (DeepPro) that only performs calculations in the time dimension for IRST detection. We conducted extensive experiments to fully validate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results are exciting, as our DeepPro outperforms existing state-of-the-art IRST detection methods on widely-used benchmarks with extremely high efficiency, and achieves a significant improvement on dim targets and in complex scenarios. We provide a new modeling domain, a new insight, a new method, and a new performance, which can promote the development of IRST detection. Codes are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal tasks. However, they remain prone to visual hallucination (VH), often producing confident but incorrect descriptions of visual content. We present VisFlow, an efficient and training-free framework designed to mitigate VH by directly manipulating attention patterns during inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify three key pathological attention behaviors in LVLMs: (1) weak visual grounding, where attention to visual tokens is insufficient or misallocated, over-focusing on uninformative regions; (2) language prior dominance, where excessive attention to prior response tokens reinforces autoregressive patterns and impairs multimodal alignment; (3) prompt redundancy, where many attention heads fixate on system prompt tokens, disrupting the integration of image, instruction, and response content. To address these issues, we introduce two inference-time interventions: token-level attention intervention (TAI), which enhances focus on salient visual content, and head-level attention intervention (HAI), which suppresses over-attention to prompt and nearby text tokens. VisFlow operates without additional training or model modifications. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks show that VisFlow effectively reduces hallucinations and improves visual factuality, with negligible computational cost.

  Traditional image similarity metrics are ineffective at evaluating the similarity between a real image of a scene and an artificially generated version of that viewpoint [6, 9, 13, 14]. Our research evaluates the effectiveness of a new, perceptual-based similarity metric, DreamSim [2], and three popular image similarity metrics: Structural Similarity (SSIM), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) [18, 19] in novel view synthesis (NVS) applications. We create a corpus of artificially corrupted images to quantify the sensitivity and discriminative power of each of the image similarity metrics. These tests reveal that traditional metrics are unable to effectively differentiate between images with minor pixel-level changes and those with substantial corruption, whereas DreamSim is more robust to minor defects and can effectively evaluate the high-level similarity of the image. Additionally, our results demonstrate that DreamSim provides a more effective and useful evaluation of render quality, especially for evaluating NVS renders in real-world use cases where slight rendering corruptions are common, but do not affect image utility for human tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional clustering methods aim to group unlabeled data points based on their similarity to each other. However, clustering, in the absence of additional information, is an ill-posed problem as there may be many different, yet equally valid, ways to partition a dataset. Distinct users may want to use different criteria to form clusters in the same data, e.g. shape v.s. color. Recently introduced text-guided image clustering methods aim to address this ambiguity by allowing users to specify the criteria of interest using natural language instructions. This instruction provides the necessary context and control needed to obtain clusters that are more aligned with the users' intent. We propose a new text-guided clustering approach named ITGC that uses an iterative discovery process, guided by an unsupervised clustering objective, to generate interpretable visual concepts that better capture the criteria expressed in a user's instructions. We report superior performance compared to existing methods across a wide variety of image clustering and fine-grained classification benchmarks.

  Continual learning in vision-language models (VLMs) faces critical challenges in balancing parameter efficiency, memory consumption, and optimization stability. While First-Order (FO) optimization (e.g., SGD) dominate current approaches, their deterministic gradients often trap models in suboptimal local minima and incur substantial memory overhead. This paper pioneers a systematic exploration of Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimization for vision-language continual learning (VLCL). We first identify the incompatibility of naive full-ZO adoption in VLCL due to modality-specific instability. To resolve this, we selectively applying ZO to either vision or language modalities while retaining FO in the complementary branch. Furthermore, we develop a layer-wise optimization paradigm that interleaves ZO and FO across network layers, capitalizing on the heterogeneous learning dynamics of shallow versus deep representations. A key theoretical insight reveals that ZO perturbations in vision branches exhibit higher variance than language counterparts, prompting a gradient sign normalization mechanism with modality-specific perturbation constraints. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing memory consumption by 89.1% compared to baselines. Code will be available upon publication.

  Visual place recognition (VPR) plays a crucial role in robotic localization and navigation. The key challenge lies in constructing feature representations that are robust to environmental changes. Existing methods typically adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision Transformers (ViTs) as feature extractors. However, these architectures excel in different aspects -- CNNs are effective at capturing local details. At the same time, ViTs are better suited for modeling global context, making it difficult to leverage the strengths of both. To address this issue, we propose a local-global feature complementation network (LGCN) for VPR which integrates a parallel CNN-ViT hybrid architecture with a dynamic feature fusion module (DFM). The DFM performs dynamic feature fusion through joint modeling of spatial and channel-wise dependencies. Furthermore, to enhance the expressiveness and adaptability of the ViT branch for VPR tasks, we introduce lightweight frequency-to-spatial fusion adapters into the frozen ViT backbone. These adapters enable task-specific adaptation with controlled parameter overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple VPR benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed LGCN consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of localization accuracy and robustness, validating its effectiveness and generalizability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to enable AI models to continuously learn from sequentially arriving data of different classes over time while retaining previously acquired knowledge. Recently, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, like prompt pool-based approaches and adapter tuning, have shown great attraction in CIL. However, these methods either introduce additional parameters that increase memory usage, or rely on rigid regularization techniques which reduce forgetting but compromise model flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Elastic Knowledge Preservation and Compensation (EKPC) method, integrating Importance-aware Parameter Regularization (IPR) and Trainable Semantic Drift Compensation (TSDC) for CIL. Specifically, the IPR method assesses the sensitivity of network parameters to prior tasks using a novel parameter-importance algorithm. It then selectively constrains updates within the shared adapter according to these importance values, thereby preserving previously acquired knowledge while maintaining the model's flexibility. However, it still exhibits slight semantic differences in previous knowledge to accommodate new incremental tasks, leading to decision boundaries confusion in classifier. To eliminate this confusion, TSDC trains a unified classifier by compensating prototypes with trainable semantic drift. Extensive experiments on five CIL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing superior performances to existing state-of-the-art methods.

  Recent advancements in multimodal large language models for video understanding (videoLLMs) have improved their ability to process dynamic multimodal data. However, trustworthiness challenges factual inaccuracies, harmful content, biases, hallucinations, and privacy risks, undermine reliability due to video data's spatiotemporal complexities. This study introduces Trust-videoLLMs, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating videoLLMs across five dimensions: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. Comprising 30 tasks with adapted, synthetic, and annotated videos, the framework assesses dynamic visual scenarios, cross-modal interactions, and real-world safety concerns. Our evaluation of 23 state-of-the-art videoLLMs (5 commercial,18 open-source) reveals significant limitations in dynamic visual scene understanding and cross-modal perturbation resilience. Open-source videoLLMs show occasional truthfulness advantages but inferior overall credibility compared to commercial models, with data diversity outperforming scale effects. These findings highlight the need for advanced safety alignment to enhance capabilities. Trust-videoLLMs provides a publicly available, extensible toolbox for standardized trustworthiness assessments, bridging the gap between accuracy-focused benchmarks and critical demands for robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy.

  In the context of multi-object tracking using video synthetic aperture radar (Video SAR), Doppler shifts induced by target motion result in artifacts that are easily mistaken for shadows caused by static occlusions. Moreover, appearance changes of the target caused by Doppler mismatch may lead to association failures and disrupt trajectory continuity. A major limitation in this field is the lack of public benchmark datasets for standardized algorithm evaluation. To address the above challenges, we collected and annotated 45 video SAR sequences containing moving targets, and named the Video SAR MOT Benchmark (VSMB). Specifically, to mitigate the effects of trailing and defocusing in moving targets, we introduce a line feature enhancement mechanism that emphasizes the positive role of motion shadows and reduces false alarms induced by static occlusions. In addition, to mitigate the adverse effects of target appearance variations, we propose a motion-aware clue discarding mechanism that substantially improves tracking robustness in Video SAR. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the VSMB, and the dataset and model are released atthis https URL.

  Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability, consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1, a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will be publicly available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce TransDiff, the first image generation model that marries Autoregressive (AR) Transformer with diffusion models. In this joint modeling framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore, building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open up a new frontier in the field of image generation.

  We present Genesis, a unified framework for joint generation of multi-view driving videos and LiDAR sequences with spatio-temporal and cross-modal consistency. Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics (FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611), and benefits downstream tasks including segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical utility of the generated data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Autoregressive Retrieval Augmentation (AR-RAG), a novel paradigm that enhances image generation by autoregressively incorporating knearest neighbor retrievals at the patch level. Unlike prior methods that perform a single, static retrieval before generation and condition the entire generation on fixed reference images, AR-RAG performs context-aware retrievals at each generation step, using prior-generated patches as queries to retrieve and incorporate the most relevant patch-level visual references, enabling the model to respond to evolving generation needs while avoiding limitations (e.g., over-copying, stylistic bias, etc.) prevalent in existing methods. To realize AR-RAG, we propose two parallel frameworks: (1) Distribution-Augmentation in Decoding (DAiD), a training-free plug-and-use decoding strategy that directly merges the distribution of model-predicted patches with the distribution of retrieved patches, and (2) Feature-Augmentation in Decoding (FAiD), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that progressively smooths the features of retrieved patches via multi-scale convolution operations and leverages them to augment the image generation process. We validate the effectiveness of AR-RAG on widely adopted benchmarks, including Midjourney-30K, GenEval and DPG-Bench, demonstrating significant performance gains over state-of-the-art image generation models.

  We introduce XYZ-IBD, a bin-picking dataset for 6D pose estimation that captures real-world industrial complexity, including challenging object geometries, reflective materials, severe occlusions, and dense clutter. The dataset reflects authentic robotic manipulation scenarios with millimeter-accurate annotations. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus on household objects, which approach saturation,XYZ-IBD represents the unsolved realistic industrial conditions. The dataset features 15 texture-less, metallic, and mostly symmetrical objects of varying shapes and sizes. These objects are heavily occluded and randomly arranged in bins with high density, replicating the challenges of real-world bin-picking. XYZ-IBD was collected using two high-precision industrial cameras and one commercially available camera, providing RGB, grayscale, and depth images. It contains 75 multi-view real-world scenes, along with a large-scale synthetic dataset rendered under simulated bin-picking conditions. We employ a meticulous annotation pipeline that includes anti-reflection spray, multi-view depth fusion, and semi-automatic annotation, achieving millimeter-level pose labeling accuracy required for industrial manipulation. Quantification in simulated environments confirms the reliability of the ground-truth annotations. We benchmark state-of-the-art methods on 2D detection, 6D pose estimation, and depth estimation tasks on our dataset, revealing significant performance degradation in our setups compared to current academic household benchmarks. By capturing the complexity of real-world bin-picking scenarios, XYZ-IBD introduces more realistic and challenging problems for future research.

  The performance of traditional text-image person retrieval task is easily affected by lighting variations due to imaging limitations of visible spectrum sensors. In recent years, cross-modal information fusion has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance retrieval robustness. By integrating complementary information from different spectral modalities, it becomes possible to achieve more stable person recognition and matching under complex real-world conditions. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel task: Text-RGBT Person Retrieval, which incorporates cross-spectrum information fusion by combining the complementary cues from visible and thermal modalities for robust person retrieval in challenging environments. The key challenge of Text-RGBT person retrieval lies in aligning text with multi-modal visual features. However, the inherent heterogeneity between visible and thermal modalities may interfere with the alignment between vision and language. To handle this problem, we propose a Decoupled Cross-modal Alignment network (DCAlign), which sufficiently mines the relationships between modality-specific and modality-collaborative visual with the text, for Text-RGBT person retrieval. To promote the research and development of this field, we create a high-quality Text-RGBT person retrieval dataset, RGBT-PEDES. RGBT-PEDES contains 1,822 identities from different age groups and genders with 4,723 pairs of calibrated RGB and T images, and covers high-diverse scenes from both daytime and nighttime with a various of challenges such as occlusion, weak alignment and adverse lighting conditions. Additionally, we carefully annotate 7,987 fine-grained textual descriptions for all RGBT person image pairs. Extensive experiments on RGBT-PEDES demonstrate that our method outperforms existing text-image person retrieval methods.

  Evaluating text-to-vision content hinges on two crucial aspects: visual quality and alignment. While significant progress has been made in developing objective models to assess these dimensions, the performance of such models heavily relies on the scale and quality of human annotations. According to Scaling Law, increasing the number of human-labeled instances follows a predictable pattern that enhances the performance of evaluation models. Therefore, we introduce a comprehensive dataset designed to Evaluate Visual quality and Alignment Level for text-to-vision content (Q-EVAL-100K), featuring the largest collection of human-labeled Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) for the mentioned two aspects. The Q-EVAL-100K dataset encompasses both text-to-image and text-to-video models, with 960K human annotations specifically focused on visual quality and alignment for 100K instances (60K images and 40K videos). Leveraging this dataset with context prompt, we propose Q-Eval-Score, a unified model capable of evaluating both visual quality and alignment with special improvements for handling long-text prompt alignment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed Q-Eval-Score achieves superior performance on both visual quality and alignment, with strong generalization capabilities across other benchmarks. These findings highlight the significant value of the Q-EVAL-100K dataset. Data and codes will be available atthis https URL.

  State-of-the-art Diffusion Models (DMs) produce highly realistic images. While prior work has successfully mitigated Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content in the visual domain, we identify a novel threat: the generation of NSFW text embedded within images. This includes offensive language, such as insults, racial slurs, and sexually explicit terms, posing significant risks to users. We show that all state-of-the-art DMs (e.g., SD3, SDXL, Flux, DeepFloyd IF) are vulnerable to this issue. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that existing mitigation techniques, effective for visual content, fail to prevent harmful text generation while substantially degrading benign text generation. As an initial step toward addressing this threat, we introduce a novel fine-tuning strategy that targets only the text-generation layers in DMs. Therefore, we construct a safety fine-tuning dataset by pairing each NSFW prompt with two images: one with the NSFW term, and another where that term is replaced with a carefully crafted benign alternative while leaving the image unchanged otherwise. By training on this dataset, the model learns to avoid generating harmful text while preserving benign content and overall image quality. Finally, to advance research in the area, we release ToxicBench, an open-source benchmark for evaluating NSFW text generation in images. It includes our curated fine-tuning dataset, a set of harmful prompts, new evaluation metrics, and a pipeline that assesses both NSFW-ness and text and image quality. Our benchmark aims to guide future efforts in mitigating NSFW text generation in text-to-image models, thereby contributing to their safe deployment. The benchmark is available online for download.

  While open-source vision-language models perform well on simple question-answering, they still struggle with complex questions that require both perceptual and reasoning capabilities. We propose LATTE, a family of vision-language models that have LeArned to Think wiTh vision spEcialists. By offloading perception to state-of-the-art vision models, our approach enables vision-language models to focus solely on reasoning over high-quality perceptual information. To train LATTE, we synthesize and filter a large dataset of 273K multi-modal reasoning traces over perceptual outputs of vision specialists. LATTE trained on this data achieves significant gains over baselines across 6 benchmarks covering both perception and reasoning abilities. Ablation studies reveal that the effectiveness of multi-modal reasoning traces depends on the data sources, formats, and quality of thoughts.

  The hierarchical architecture has become a mainstream design paradigm for Vision Transformers (ViTs), with Patch Merging serving as the pivotal component that transforms a columnar architecture into a hierarchical one. Drawing inspiration from the brain's ability to integrate global and local information for comprehensive visual understanding, we propose Stepwise Patch Merging (SPM), which enhances the subsequent attention mechanism's ability to 'see' better. SPM consists of Multi-Scale Aggregation (MSA) and Guided Local Enhancement (GLE) striking a proper balance between long-range dependency modeling and local feature enhancement. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet-1K, COCO, and ADE20K, demonstrate that SPM significantly improves the performance of various models, particularly in dense prediction tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Meanwhile, experiments show that combining SPM with different backbones can further improve performance. The code has been released atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object pose estimation is essential to many industrial applications involving robotic manipulation, navigation, and augmented reality. Current generalizable object pose estimators, i.e., approaches that do not need to be trained per object, rely on accurate 3D models. Predominantly, CAD models are used, which can be hard to obtain in practice. At the same time, it is often possible to acquire images of an object. Naturally, this leads to the question whether 3D models reconstructed from images are sufficient to facilitate accurate object pose estimation. We aim to answer this question by proposing a novel benchmark for measuring the impact of 3D reconstruction quality on pose estimation accuracy. Our benchmark provides calibrated images for object reconstruction registered with the test images of the YCB-V dataset for pose evaluation under the BOP benchmark format. Detailed experiments with multiple state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction and object pose estimation approaches show that the geometry produced by modern reconstruction methods is often sufficient for accurate pose estimation. Our experiments lead to interesting observations: (1) Standard metrics for measuring 3D reconstruction quality are not necessarily indicative of pose estimation accuracy, which shows the need for dedicated benchmarks such as ours. (2) Classical, non-learning-based approaches can perform on par with modern learning-based reconstruction techniques and can even offer a better reconstruction time-pose accuracy tradeoff. (3) There is still a sizable gap between performance with reconstructed and with CAD models. To foster research on closing this gap, our benchmark is publicly available atthis https URL}.

  Recent CLIP-like Vision-Language Models (VLMs), pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs to align both modalities with a simple contrastive objective, have paved the way to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Given an arbitrary set of textual queries, image pixels are assigned the closest query in feature space. However, this works well when a user exhaustively lists all possible visual concepts in an image that contrast against each other for the assignment. This corresponds to the current evaluation setup in the literature, which relies on having access to a list of in-domain relevant concepts, typically classes of a benchmark dataset. Here, we consider the more challenging (and realistic) scenario of segmenting a single concept, given a textual prompt and nothing else. To achieve good results, besides contrasting with the generic 'background' text, we propose two different approaches to automatically generate, at test time, query-specific textual contrastive concepts. We do so by leveraging the distribution of text in the VLM's training set or crafted LLM prompts. We also propose a metric designed to evaluate this scenario and show the relevance of our approach on commonly used datasets.

  Edge detection is a fundamental task in computer vision. It has made great progress under the development of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), some of which have achieved a beyond human-level performance. However, recent top-performing edge detection methods tend to generate thick and noisy edge lines. In this work, we solve this problem from two aspects: (1) the lack of prior knowledge regarding image edges, and (2) the issue of imbalanced pixel distribution. We propose a second-order derivative-based multi-scale contextual enhancement module (SDMCM) to help the model locate true edge pixels accurately by introducing the edge prior knowledge. We also construct a hybrid focal loss function (HFL) to alleviate the imbalanced distribution issue. In addition, we employ the conditionally parameterized convolution (CondConv) to develop a novel boundary refinement module (BRM), which can further refine the final output edge maps. In the end, we propose a U-shape network named LUS-Net which is based on the SDMCM and BRM for crisp edge detection. We perform extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks, and the experiment results illustrate that our method can predict crisp and clean edge maps and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BSDS500 dataset (ODS=0.829), NYUD-V2 dataset (ODS=0.768), and BIPED dataset (ODS=0.903).

  Decoder-only methods, such as GPT, have demonstrated superior performance in many areas compared to traditional encoder-decoder structure transformer methods. Over the years, end-to-end methods based on the traditional transformer structure, like MOTR, have achieved remarkable performance in multi-object tracking. However,The substantial computational resource consumption of these methods, coupled with the optimization challenges posed by dynamic data, results in less favorable inference speeds and training times. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper optimized the network architecture and proposed an effective training strategy to mitigate the problem of prolonged training times, thereby developing DecoderTrack, a novel end-to-end tracking method. Subsequently, to tackle the optimization challenges arising from dynamic data, this paper introduced DecoderTrack+ by incorporating a Fixed-Size Query Memory and refining certain attention layers. Our methods, without any bells and whistles, outperforms MOTR on multiple benchmarks, with inference speeds 2.06 and 3.03 times faster than MOTR, respectively

  We investigate the problem of Object State Classification (OSC) as a zero-shot learning problem. Specifically, we propose the first Object-agnostic State Classification (OaSC) method that infers the state of a certain object without relying on the knowledge or the estimation of the object class. In that direction, we capitalize on Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for structuring and organizing knowledge, which, in combination with visual information, enable the inference of the states of objects in object/state pairs that have not been encountered in the method's training set. A series of experiments investigate the performance of the proposed method in various settings, against several hypotheses and in comparison with state of the art approaches for object attribute classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the knowledge of an object class is not decisive for the prediction of its state. Moreover, the proposed OaSC method outperforms existing methods in all datasets and benchmarks by a great margin.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sampling from language models impacts the quality and diversity of outputs, affecting both research and real-world applications. Recently, Nguyen et al. 2024's "Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM Outputs" introduced a new sampler called min-p, claiming it achieves superior quality and diversity over established samplers such as basic, top-k, and top-p sampling. The significance of these claims was underscored by the paper's recognition as the 18th highest-scoring submission to ICLR 2025 and selection for an Oral presentation. This paper conducts a comprehensive re-examination of the evidence supporting min-p and reaches different conclusions from the original paper's four lines of evidence. First, the original paper's human evaluations omitted data, conducted statistical tests incorrectly, and described qualitative feedback inaccurately; our reanalysis demonstrates min-p did not outperform baselines in quality, diversity, or a trade-off between quality and diversity; in response to our findings, the authors of the original paper conducted a new human evaluation using a different implementation, task, and rubric that nevertheless provides further evidence min-p does not improve over baselines. Second, comprehensively sweeping the original paper's NLP benchmarks reveals min-p does not surpass baselines when controlling for the number of hyperparameters. Third, the original paper's LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations lack methodological clarity and appear inconsistently reported. Fourth, community adoption claims (49k GitHub repositories, 1.1M GitHub stars) were found to be unsubstantiated, leading to their removal; the revised adoption claim remains misleading. We conclude that evidence presented in the original paper fails to support claims that min-p improves quality, diversity, or a trade-off between quality and diversity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce MiniMax-M1, the world's first open-weight, large-scale hybrid-attention reasoning model. MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention mechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model, which contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters activated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1 million tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning attention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time compute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that require processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including sandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to M1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel RL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling weights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants. Combining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on 512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just $534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K thinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate phase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our models are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the original DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex software engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks. We publicly release MiniMax-M1 atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, quantization has been widely used for the compression and acceleration of large language models (LLMs). Due to the outliers in LLMs, it is crucial to flatten weights and activations to minimize quantization error with equally spaced quantization points. Prior research explores various pre-quantization transformations to suppress outliers, such as per-channel scaling and Hadamard transformation. However, we observe that these transformed weights and activations can still exhibit steep and dispersed distributions. In this paper, we propose FlatQuant (Fast and Learnable Affine Transformation), a new post-training quantization approach that enhances the flatness of weights and activations. Our approach identifies optimal affine transformations for each linear layer, calibrated in hours via a lightweight objective. To reduce runtime overhead of affine transformation, we apply Kronecker product with two lightweight matrices, and fuse all operations in FlatQuant into a single kernel. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlatQuant establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark for quantization. For example, it achieves less than 1\% accuracy drop for W4A4 quantization on the LLaMA-3-70B model, surpassing SpinQuant by 7.5\%. Additionally, it provides up to 2.3x prefill speedup and 1.7x decoding speedup compared to the FP16 model. Code is available at:this https URL.

  Controlling the generation of large language models (LLMs) remains a central challenge to ensure their safe and reliable deployment. While prompt engineering and finetuning are common approaches, recent work has explored latent steering, a lightweight technique that alters LLM internal activations to guide generation. However, subsequent studies revealed latent steering's effectiveness to be limited, often underperforming simple instruction prompting. To address this limitation, we first establish a benchmark across diverse behaviors for standardized evaluation of steering techniques. Building on insights from this benchmark, we introduce Instruction Attention Boosting (InstABoost), a latent steering method that boosts the strength of instruction prompting by altering the model's attention during generation. InstABoost combines the strengths of existing approaches and is theoretically supported by prior work that suggests that in-context rule following in transformer-based models can be controlled by manipulating attention on instructions. Empirically, InstABoost demonstrates superior control success compared to both traditional prompting and latent steering.

  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive reasoning abilities in structured tasks like mathematics and programming, largely driven by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses outcome-based signals that are scalable, effective, and robust against reward hacking. However, applying similar techniques to open-ended long-form reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of generic, verifiable reward signals. To address this, we propose Direct Reasoning Optimization (DRO), a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning LLMs on open-ended, particularly long-form, reasoning tasks, guided by a new reward signal: the Reasoning Reflection Reward (R3). At its core, R3 selectively identifies and emphasizes key tokens in the reference outcome that reflect the influence of the model's preceding chain-of-thought reasoning, thereby capturing the consistency between reasoning and reference outcome at a fine-grained level. Crucially, R3 is computed internally using the same model being optimized, enabling a fully self-contained training setup. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic data filtering strategy based on R3 for open-ended reasoning tasks, reducing cost while improving downstream performance. We evaluate DRO on two diverse datasets -- ParaRev, a long-form paragraph revision task, and FinQA, a math-oriented QA benchmark -- and show that it consistently outperforms strong baselines while remaining broadly applicable across both open-ended and structured domains.

  In this work, we investigate the synergy between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) in developing strong reasoning models. We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe.

  Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a commonly used approach for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date information. However, the retrieved sources can often contain conflicting information and it remains unclear how models should address such discrepancies. In this work, we first propose a novel taxonomy of knowledge conflict types in RAG, along with the desired model behavior for each type. We then introduce CONFLICTS, a high-quality benchmark with expert annotations of conflict types in a realistic RAG setting. CONFLICTS is the first benchmark that enables tracking progress on how models address a wide range of knowledge conflicts. We conduct extensive experiments on this benchmark, showing that LLMs often struggle to appropriately resolve conflicts between sources. While prompting LLMs to explicitly reason about the potential conflict in the retrieved documents significantly improves the quality and appropriateness of their responses, substantial room for improvement in future research remains.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce SelfCite, a novel self-supervised approach that aligns LLMs to generate high-quality, fine-grained, sentence-level citations for the statements in their generated responses. Instead of only relying on costly and labor-intensive annotations, SelfCite leverages a reward signal provided by the LLM itself through context ablation: If a citation is necessary, removing the cited text from the context should prevent the same response; if sufficient, retaining the cited text alone should preserve the same response. This reward can guide the inference-time best-of-N sampling strategy to improve citation quality significantly, as well as be used in preference optimization to directly fine-tune the models for generating better citations. The effectiveness of SelfCite is demonstrated by increasing citation F1 up to 5.3 points on the LongBench-Cite benchmark across five long-form question answering tasks.

  Recent deep-thinking large language models often reason extensively to improve performance, but such lengthy reasoning is not always desirable, as it incurs excessive inference costs with disproportionate performance gains. Controlling reasoning length without sacrificing performance is therefore important, but remains challenging, especially under tight thinking budgets. We propose budget guidance, a simple yet effective method for steering the reasoning process of LLMs toward a target budget without requiring any LLM fine-tuning. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor that models a Gamma distribution over the remaining thinking length during next-token generation. This signal is then used to guide generation in a soft, token-level manner, ensuring that the overall reasoning trace adheres to the specified thinking budget. Budget guidance enables natural control of the thinking length, along with significant token efficiency improvements over baseline methods on challenging math benchmarks. For instance, it achieves up to a 26% accuracy gain on the MATH-500 benchmark under tight budgets compared to baseline methods, while maintaining competitive accuracy with only 63% of the thinking tokens used by the full-thinking model. Budget guidance also generalizes to broader task domains and exhibits emergent capabilities, such as estimating question difficulty. The source code is available at:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become crucial for rapidly adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. Prefix-Tuning, an early and effective PEFT technique, demonstrated the ability to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning with significantly reduced computational and memory overhead. However, despite its earlier success, its effectiveness in training modern state-of-the-art LLMs has been very limited. In this work, we demonstrate empirically that Prefix-Tuning underperforms on LLMs because of an inherent tradeoff between input and prefix significance within the attention head. This motivates us to introduce Prefix-Tuning+, a novel architecture that generalizes the principles of Prefix-Tuning while addressing its shortcomings by shifting the prefix module out of the attention head itself. We further provide an overview of our construction process to guide future users when constructing their own context-based methods. Our experiments show that, across a diverse set of benchmarks, Prefix-Tuning+ consistently outperforms existing Prefix-Tuning methods. Notably, it achieves performance on par with the widely adopted LoRA method on several general benchmarks, highlighting the potential modern extension of Prefix-Tuning approaches. Our findings suggest that by overcoming its inherent limitations, Prefix-Tuning can remain a competitive and relevant research direction in the landscape of parameter-efficient LLM adaptation.

  Pragmatics, the ability to infer meaning beyond literal interpretation, is crucial for social cognition and communication. While LLMs have been benchmarked for their pragmatic understanding, improving their performance remains underexplored. Existing methods rely on annotated labels but overlook the reasoning process humans naturally use to interpret implicit meaning. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel pragmatic dataset, ImpliedMeaningPreference, that includes explicit reasoning (thoughts) for both correct and incorrect interpretations. Through preference-tuning and supervised fine-tuning, we demonstrate that thought-based learning significantly enhances LLMs' pragmatic understanding, improving accuracy by 11.12% across model families. We further discuss a transfer-learning study where we evaluate the performance of thought-based training for the other tasks of pragmatics (presupposition, deixis) that are not seen during the training time and observe an improvement of 16.10% compared to label-trained models.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across tasks such as mathematics, coding, and reasoning, yet their learning ability, which is crucial for adapting to dynamic environments and acquiring new knowledge, remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a framework inspired by cognitive psychology and education. Specifically, we decompose general learning ability into three distinct, complementary dimensions: Learning from Instructor (acquiring knowledge via explicit guidance), Learning from Concept (internalizing abstract structures and generalizing to new contexts), and Learning from Experience (adapting through accumulated exploration and feedback). We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across the three learning dimensions and identify several insightful findings, such as (i) interaction improves learning; (ii) conceptual understanding is scale-emergent and benefits larger models; and (iii) LLMs are effective few-shot learners but not many-shot learners. Based on our framework and empirical findings, we introduce a benchmark that provides a unified and realistic evaluation of LLMs' general learning abilities across three learning cognition dimensions. It enables diagnostic insights and supports evaluation and development of more adaptive and human-like models.

  Long-term memory (LTM) is essential for large language models (LLMs) to achieve autonomous intelligence in complex, evolving environments. Despite increasing efforts in memory-augmented and retrieval-based architectures, there remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to systematically evaluate LLMs' long-term memory abilities. Existing benchmarks still face challenges in evaluating knowledge retention and dynamic sequential reasoning, and in their own flexibility, all of which limit their effectiveness in assessing models' LTM capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose a novel benchmark framework based on interactive fiction games, featuring dynamically branching storylines with complex reasoning structures. These structures simulate real-world scenarios by requiring LLMs to navigate hierarchical decision trees, where each choice triggers cascading dependencies across multi-turn interactions. Our benchmark emphasizes two distinct settings to test reasoning complexity: one with immediate feedback upon incorrect decisions, and the other requiring models to independently trace back and revise earlier choices after failure. As part of this benchmark, we also construct a new dataset designed to test LLMs' LTM within narrative-driven environments. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach through detailed experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the benchmark's ability to robustly and reliably assess LTM in LLMs.

  Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as the core of agent frameworks in various scenarios, such as social simulations and AI companions. However, the extent to which they can replicate human-like motivations remains an underexplored question. Existing benchmarks are constrained by simplistic scenarios and the absence of character identities, resulting in an information asymmetry with real-world situations. To address this gap, we propose MotiveBench, which consists of 200 rich contextual scenarios and 600 reasoning tasks covering multiple levels of motivation. Using MotiveBench, we conduct extensive experiments on seven popular model families, comparing different scales and versions within each family. The results show that even the most advanced LLMs still fall short in achieving human-like motivational reasoning. Our analysis reveals key findings, including the difficulty LLMs face in reasoning about "love & belonging" motivations and their tendency toward excessive rationality and idealism. These insights highlight a promising direction for future research on the humanization of LLMs. The dataset, benchmark, and code are available atthis https URL.

  We introduce Konooz, a novel multi-dimensional corpus covering 16 Arabic dialects across 10 domains, resulting in 160 distinct corpora. The corpus comprises about 777k tokens, carefully collected and manually annotated with 21 entity types using both nested and flat annotation schemes - using the Wojood guidelines. While Konooz is useful for various NLP tasks like domain adaptation and transfer learning, this paper primarily focuses on benchmarking existing Arabic Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, especially cross-domain and cross-dialect model performance. Our benchmarking of four Arabic NER models using Konooz reveals a significant drop in performance of up to 38% when compared to the in-distribution data. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of domain and dialect divergence and the impact of resource scarcity. We also measured the overlap between domains and dialects using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric, and illustrated why certain NER models perform better on specific dialects and domains.

  While Mamba has demonstrated strong performance in language modeling, its potential as a speech self-supervised (SSL) model remains underexplored, with prior studies limited to isolated tasks. To address this, we explore Mamba-based HuBERT models as alternatives to Transformer-based SSL architectures. Leveraging the linear-time Selective State Space, these models enable fine-tuning on long-context ASR with significantly lower compute. Moreover, they show superior performance when fine-tuned for streaming ASR. Beyond fine-tuning, these models show competitive performance on SUPERB probing benchmarks, particularly in causal settings. Our analysis shows that they yield higher-quality quantized representations and capture speaker-related features more distinctly than Transformer-based models. These findings highlight Mamba-based SSL as a promising and complementary direction for long-sequence modeling, real-time speech modeling, and speech unit extraction.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential for advancing fact-checking by leveraging their capabilities in reasoning, evidence retrieval, and explanation generation. However, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate LLMs and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in realistic misinformation scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RealFactBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the fact-checking capabilities of LLMs and MLLMs across diverse real-world tasks, including Knowledge Validation, Rumor Detection, and Event Verification. RealFactBench consists of 6K high-quality claims drawn from authoritative sources, encompassing multimodal content and diverse domains. Our evaluation framework further introduces the Unknown Rate (UnR) metric, enabling a more nuanced assessment of models' ability to handle uncertainty and balance between over-conservatism and over-confidence. Extensive experiments on 7 representative LLMs and 4 MLLMs reveal their limitations in real-world fact-checking and offer valuable insights for further research.

  An growing number of studies have examined the social bias of rapidly developed large language models (LLMs). Although most of these studies have focused on bias occurring in a single social attribute, research in social science has shown that social bias often occurs in the form of intersectionality -- the constitutive and contextualized perspective on bias aroused by social attributes. In this study, we construct the Japanese benchmark inter-JBBQ, designed to evaluate the intersectional bias in LLMs on the question-answering setting. Using inter-JBBQ to analyze GPT-4o and Swallow, we find that biased output varies according to its contexts even with the equal combination of social attributes.

  Medical Question-Answering (QA) encompasses a broad spectrum of tasks, including multiple choice questions (MCQ), open-ended text generation, and complex computational reasoning. Despite this variety, a unified framework for delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1 demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. The code will be released.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday applications. As their influence grows, understanding their decision making and underlying personality becomes essential. In this work, we interpret model personality using our proposed Supernova Event Dataset, a novel dataset with diverse articles spanning biographies, historical events, news, and scientific discoveries. We use this dataset to benchmark LLMs on extracting and ranking key events from text, a subjective and complex challenge that requires reasoning over long-range context and modeling causal chains. We evaluate small models like Phi-4, Orca 2, and Qwen 2.5, and large, stronger models such as Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and OpenAI o3, and propose a framework where another LLM acts as a judge to infer each model's personality based on its selection and classification of events. Our analysis shows distinct personality traits: for instance, Orca 2 demonstrates emotional reasoning focusing on interpersonal dynamics, while Qwen 2.5 displays a more strategic, analytical style. When analyzing scientific discovery events, Claude Sonnet 3.7 emphasizes conceptual framing, Gemini 2.5 Pro prioritizes empirical validation, and o3 favors step-by-step causal reasoning. This analysis improves model interpretability, making them user-friendly for a wide range of diverse applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent advent of reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 was met with excited speculation by the AI community about the mechanisms underlying these capabilities in closed models, followed by a rush of replication efforts, particularly from the open source community. These speculations were largely settled by the demonstration from DeepSeek-R1 that chains-of-thought and reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively replicate reasoning on top of base LLMs. However, it remains valuable to explore alternative methods for theoretically eliciting reasoning that could help elucidate the underlying mechanisms, as well as providing additional methods that may offer complementary benefits.Here, we build on the long-standing literature in cognitive psychology and cognitive architectures, which postulates that reasoning arises from the orchestrated, sequential execution of a set of modular, predetermined cognitive operations. Crucially, we implement this key idea within a modern agentic tool-calling framework. In particular, we endow an LLM with a small set of "cognitive tools" encapsulating specific reasoning operations, each executed by the LLM itself. Surprisingly, this simple strategy results in considerable gains in performance on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to base LLMs, for both closed and open-weight models. For instance, providing our "cognitive tools" to GPT-4.1 increases its pass@1 performance on AIME2024 from 26.7% to 43.3%, bringing it very close to the performance of o1-preview.In addition to its practical implications, this demonstration contributes to the debate regarding the role of post-training methods in eliciting reasoning in LLMs versus the role of inherent capabilities acquired during pre-training, and whether post-training merely uncovers these latent abilities.

  The advancement of text-to-speech and audio generation models necessitates robust benchmarks for evaluating the emotional understanding capabilities of AI systems. Current speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets often exhibit limitations in emotional granularity, privacy concerns, or reliance on acted portrayals. This paper introduces EmoNet-Voice, a new resource for speech emotion detection, which includes EmoNet-Voice Big, a large-scale pre-training dataset (featuring over 4,500 hours of speech across 11 voices, 40 emotions, and 4 languages), and EmoNet-Voice Bench, a novel benchmark dataset with human expert annotations. EmoNet-Voice is designed to evaluate SER models on a fine-grained spectrum of 40 emotion categories with different levels of intensities. Leveraging state-of-the-art voice generation, we curated synthetic audio snippets simulating actors portraying scenes designed to evoke specific emotions. Crucially, we conducted rigorous validation by psychology experts who assigned perceived intensity labels. This synthetic, privacy-preserving approach allows for the inclusion of sensitive emotional states often absent in existing datasets. Lastly, we introduce Empathic Insight Voice models that set a new standard in speech emotion recognition with high agreement with human experts. Our evaluations across the current model landscape exhibit valuable findings, such as high-arousal emotions like anger being much easier to detect than low-arousal states like concentration.

  We present the first comprehensive study of latent multi-head attention (MLA) for small language models, revealing interesting efficiency-quality trade-offs. Training 30M-parameter GPT models on 100,000 synthetic stories, we benchmark three architectural variants: standard multi-head attention (MHA), MLA, and MLA with rotary positional embeddings (MLA+RoPE). Our key finding is that MLA+RoPE with half-rank latent dimensions (r = d/2) achieves a 45% KV-cache memory reduction while incurring only a 0.3% increase in validation loss (essentially matching MHA quality)- a Pareto improvement for memory constrained deployment. We further show that RoPE is crucial for MLA in small models: without it, MLA underperforms vanilla attention by 3-5%, but with RoPE, it surpasses vanilla by 2%. Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2 achieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory savings. GPT-4 evaluations corroborate perplexity results, with ours achieving the highest quality scores (7.4/10) across grammar, creativity, and consistency metrics. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training. However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering 11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive progress in mathematical reasoning. While data augmentation is promising to enhance mathematical problem-solving ability, current approaches are predominantly limited to instance-level modifications-such as rephrasing or generating syntactic variations-which fail to capture and leverage the intrinsic relational structures inherent in mathematical knowledge. Inspired by human learning processes, where mathematical proficiency develops through systematic exposure to interconnected concepts, we introduce MathFusion, a novel framework that enhances mathematical reasoning through cross-problem instruction synthesis. MathFusion implements this through three fusion strategies: (1) sequential fusion, which chains related problems to model solution dependencies; (2) parallel fusion, which combines analogous problems to reinforce conceptual understanding; and (3) conditional fusion, which creates context-aware selective problems to enhance reasoning flexibility. By applying these strategies, we generate a new dataset, \textbf{MathFusionQA}, followed by fine-tuning models (DeepSeekMath-7B, Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B) on it. Experimental results demonstrate that MathFusion achieves substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning while maintaining high data efficiency, boosting performance by 18.0 points in accuracy across diverse benchmarks while requiring only 45K additional synthetic instructions, representing a substantial improvement over traditional single-instruction approaches. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Recent studies have shown that increasing test-time computation enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This typically involves extensive sampling at inference time guided by an external LLM verifier, resulting in a two-player system. Despite external guidance, the effectiveness of this system demonstrates the potential of a single LLM to tackle complex tasks. Thus, we pose a new research problem: Can we internalize the searching capabilities to fundamentally enhance the reasoning abilities of a single LLM? This work explores an orthogonal direction focusing on post-training LLMs for autoregressive searching (i.e., an extended reasoning process with self-reflection and self-exploration of new strategies). To achieve this, we propose the Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT) reasoning and a two-stage training paradigm: 1) a small-scale format tuning stage to internalize the COAT reasoning format and 2) a large-scale self-improvement stage leveraging reinforcement learning. Our approach results in Satori, a 7B LLM trained on open-source models and data. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Satori achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while exhibits strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks. Code, data, and models are fully open-sourced.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model merging, a method that combines the parameters and embeddings of multiple fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), offers a promising approach to enhance model performance across various tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. This paper introduces Activation-Informed Merging (AIM), a technique that integrates the information from the activation space of LLMs into the merging process to improve performance and robustness. AIM is designed as a flexible, complementary solution that is applicable to any existing merging method. It aims to preserve critical weights from the base model, drawing on principles from continual learning (CL) and model compression. Utilizing a task-agnostic calibration set, AIM selectively prioritizes essential weights during merging. We empirically demonstrate that AIM significantly enhances the performance of merged models across multiple benchmarks. Our findings suggest that considering the activation-space information can provide substantial advancements in the model merging strategies for LLMs, with up to a 40% increase in benchmark performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent in tasks related to cultural heritage, such as generating descriptions of historical monuments, translating ancient texts, preserving oral traditions, and creating educational content, their ability to produce accurate and culturally aligned texts is being increasingly relied upon by users and researchers. However, cultural value misalignments may exist in generated texts, such as the misrepresentation of historical facts, the erosion of cultural identity, and the oversimplification of complex cultural narratives, which may lead to severe consequences. Therefore, investigating value misalignment in the context of LLM for cultural heritage is crucial for mitigating these risks, yet there has been a significant lack of systematic and comprehensive study and investigation in this area. To fill this gap, we systematically assess the reliability of LLMs in generating culturally aligned texts for cultural heritage-related tasks. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by compiling an extensive set of 1066 query tasks covering 5 widely recognized categories with 17 aspects within the knowledge framework of cultural heritage across 5 open-source LLMs, and examine both the type and rate of cultural value misalignments in the generated texts. Using both automated and manual approaches, we effectively detect and analyze the cultural value misalignments in LLM-generated texts. Our findings are concerning: over 65% of the generated texts exhibit notable cultural misalignments, with certain tasks demonstrating almost complete misalignment with key cultural values. Beyond these findings, this paper introduces a benchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation workflow that can serve as a valuable resource for future research aimed at enhancing the cultural sensitivity and reliability of LLMs.

  Question answering on free-form tables (a.k.a. TableQA) is a challenging task because of the flexible structure and complex schema of tables. Recent studies use Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task, exploiting their capability in understanding the questions and tabular data, which are typically given in natural language and contain many textual fields, respectively. While this approach has shown promising results, it overlooks the challenges brought by numerical values which are common in tabular data, and LLMs are known to struggle with such values. We aim to address this issue, and we propose a model named TabLaP that uses LLMs as a planner rather than an answer generator. This approach exploits LLMs' capability in multi-step reasoning while leaving the actual numerical calculations to a Python interpreter for accurate calculation. Recognizing the inaccurate nature of LLMs, we further make a first attempt to quantify the trustworthiness of the answers produced by TabLaP, such that users can use TabLaP in a regret-aware manner. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that TabLaP is substantially more accurate than the state-of-the-art models, improving the answer accuracy by 5.7% and 5.8% on the two datasets, respectively.

  Writing clinical notes and documenting medical exams is a critical task for healthcare professionals, serving as a vital component of patient care documentation. However, manually writing these notes is time-consuming and can impact the amount of time clinicians can spend on direct patient interaction and other tasks. Consequently, the development of automated clinical note generation systems has emerged as a clinically meaningful area of research within AI for health. In this paper, we present three key contributions to the field of clinical note generation using large language models (LLMs). First, we introduce CliniKnote, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 1,200 complex doctor-patient conversations paired with their full clinical notes. This dataset, created and curated by medical experts with the help of modern neural networks, provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating models in clinical note generation tasks. Second, we propose the K-SOAP (Keyword, Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) note format, which enhances traditional SOAP~\cite{podder2023soap} (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes by adding a keyword section at the top, allowing for quick identification of essential information. Third, we develop an automatic pipeline to generate K-SOAP notes from doctor-patient conversations and benchmark various modern LLMs using various metrics. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency and performance compared to standard LLM finetuning methods.

  Current research in LLM-based simulation systems lacks comprehensive solutions for modeling real-world court proceedings, while existing legal language models struggle with dynamic courtroom interactions. We present AgentCourt, a comprehensive legal simulation framework that addresses these challenges through adversarial evolution of LLM-based agents. Our AgentCourt introduces a new adversarial evolutionary approach for agents called AdvEvol, which performs dynamic knowledge learning and evolution through structured adversarial interactions in a simulated courtroom program, breaking the limitations of the traditional reliance on static knowledge bases or manual annotations. By simulating 1,000 civil cases, we construct an evolving knowledge base that enhances the agents' legal reasoning abilities. The evolved lawyer agents demonstrated outstanding performance on our newly introduced CourtBench benchmark, achieving a 12.1% improvement in performance compared to the original lawyer agents. Evaluations by professional lawyers confirm the effectiveness of our approach across three critical dimensions: cognitive agility, professional knowledge, and logical rigor. Beyond outperforming specialized legal models in interactive reasoning tasks, our findings emphasize the importance of adversarial learning in legal AI and suggest promising directions for extending simulation-based legal reasoning to broader judicial and regulatory contexts.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) require careful safety alignment to prevent malicious outputs. While significant research focuses on mitigating harmful content generation, the enhanced safety often come with the side effect of over-refusal, where LLMs may reject innocuous prompts and become less helpful. Although the issue of over-refusal has been empirically observed, a systematic measurement is challenging due to the difficulty of crafting prompts that can elicit the over-refusal behaviors of LLMs. This study proposes a novel method for automatically generating large-scale over-refusal datasets. Leveraging this technique, we introduce OR-Bench, the first large-scale over-refusal benchmark. OR-Bench comprises 80,000 over-refusal prompts across 10 common rejection categories, a subset of around 1,000 hard prompts that are challenging even for state-of-the-art LLMs, and an additional 600 toxic prompts to prevent indiscriminate responses. We then conduct a comprehensive study to measure the over-refusal of 32 popular LLMs across 8 model families. Our datasets are publicly available atthis https URLand our codebase is open-sourced atthis https URL. We hope this benchmark can help the community develop better safety aligned models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A compelling portrayal of characters is essential to the success of narrative writing. For readers, appreciating a character's traits requires the ability to infer their evolving beliefs, desires, and intentions over the course of a complex storyline, a cognitive skill known as Theory-of-Mind (ToM). Performing ToM reasoning in prolonged narratives requires readers to integrate historical context with current narrative information, a task at which humans excel but Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle. To systematically evaluate LLMs' ToM reasoning capability in long narratives, we construct LitCharToM, a benchmark of character-centric questions across four ToM dimensions from classic literature. Further, we introduce EvolvTrip, a perspective-aware temporal knowledge graph that tracks psychological development throughout narratives. Our experiments demonstrate that EvolvTrip consistently enhances performance of LLMs across varying scales, even in challenging extended-context scenarios. EvolvTrip proves to be particularly valuable for smaller models, partially bridging the performance gap with larger LLMs and showing great compatibility with lengthy narratives. Our findings highlight the importance of explicit representation of temporal character mental states in narrative comprehension and offer a foundation for more sophisticated character understanding. Our data and code are publicly available atthis https URL.

  As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, reliable evaluation methods are essential particularly for open-ended, instruction-following tasks. LLM-as-a-Judge enables automatic evaluation using LLMs as evaluators, but its reliability remains uncertain. In this work, we analyze key factors affecting its trustworthiness, focusing on alignment with human judgments and evaluation consistency. Using BIGGENBench and EvalBiasBench, we study the effects of evaluation design, decoding strategies, and Chain-of-Tought (CoT) reasoning in evaluation. Our results show that evaluation criteria are critical for reliability, non-deterministic sampling improves alignment with human preferences over deterministic evaluation, and CoT reasoning offers minimal gains when clear evaluation criteria are present.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained via next-word prediction (NWP), which provides strong surface-level fluency but often lacks support for robust reasoning. We propose BOttlenecked next Word exploration (BOW), a novel RL framework that rethinks NWP by introducing a reasoning bottleneck where a policy model first generates a reasoning path rather than predicting the next token directly, after which a frozen judge model predicts the next token distribution based solely on this reasoning path. We train the policy model using GRPO with rewards that quantify how effectively the reasoning path facilitates next-word recovery. Compared with other continual pretraining baselines, we show that BOW improves both the general and next-word reasoning capabilities of the base model, evaluated on various benchmarks. Our findings show that BOW can serve as an effective and scalable alternative to vanilla NWP.

  We introduce TurBLiMP, the first Turkish benchmark of linguistic minimal pairs, designed to evaluate the linguistic abilities of monolingual and multilingual language models (LMs). Covering 16 linguistic phenomena with 1000 minimal pairs each, TurBLiMP fills an important gap in linguistic evaluation resources for Turkish. In designing the benchmark, we give extra attention to two properties of Turkish that remain understudied in current syntactic evaluations of LMs, namely word order flexibility and subordination through morphological processes. Our experiments on a wide range of LMs and a newly collected set of human acceptability judgments reveal that even cutting-edge Large LMs still struggle with grammatical phenomena that are not challenging for humans, and may also exhibit different sensitivities to word order and morphological complexity compared to humans.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) aims to identify the stance of text toward previously unseen targets, a setting where conventional supervised models often fail due to reliance on labeled data and shallow lexical cues. Inspired by human cognitive reasoning, we propose the Cognitive Inductive Reasoning Framework (CIRF), which abstracts transferable reasoning schemas from unlabeled text and encodes them as concept-level logic. To integrate these schemas with input arguments, we introduce a Schema-Enhanced Graph Kernel Model (SEGKM) that dynamically aligns local and global reasoning structures. Experiments on SemEval-2016, VAST, and COVID-19-Stance benchmarks show that CIRF establishes new state-of-the-art results, outperforming strong ZSSD baselines by 1.0, 4.5, and 3.3 percentage points in macro-F1, respectively, and achieving comparable accuracy with 70\% fewer labeled examples. We will release the full code upon publication.

  With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an increasing need for challenging benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities in handling complex tabular data. However, existing benchmarks are either based on outdated data setups or focus solely on simple, flat table structures. In this paper, we introduce RealHiTBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of both LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) across a variety of input formats for complex tabular data, including LaTeX, HTML, and PNG. RealHiTBench also includes a diverse collection of tables with intricate structures, spanning a wide range of task types. Our experimental results, using 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrate that RealHiTBench is indeed a challenging benchmark. Moreover, we also develop TreeThinker, a tree-based pipeline that organizes hierarchical headers into a tree structure for enhanced tabular reasoning, validating the importance of improving LLMs' perception of table hierarchies. We hope that our work will inspire further research on tabular data reasoning and the development of more robust models. The code and data are available atthis https URL.

  _Zijie Lin, Yang Zhang, Xiaoyan Zhao, Fengbin Zhu, Fuli Feng, Tat-Seng Chua_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for recommendation by framing item prediction as a token-by-token language generation task. However, existing methods treat all item tokens equally, simply pursuing likelihood maximization during both optimization and decoding. This overlooks crucial token-level differences in decisiveness-many tokens contribute little to item discrimination yet can dominate optimization or decoding. To quantify token decisiveness, we propose a novel perspective that models item generation as a decision process, measuring token decisiveness by the Information Gain (IG) each token provides in reducing uncertainty about the generated item. Our empirical analysis reveals that most tokens have low IG but often correspond to high logits, disproportionately influencing training loss and decoding, which may impair model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce an Information Gain-based Decisiveness-aware Token handling (IGD) strategy that integrates token decisiveness into both tuning and decoding. Specifically, IGD downweights low-IG tokens during tuning and rebalances decoding to emphasize tokens with high IG. In this way, IGD moves beyond pure likelihood maximization, effectively prioritizing high-decisiveness tokens. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets with two LLM backbones demonstrate that IGD consistently improves recommendation accuracy, achieving significant gains on widely used ranking metrics compared to strong baselines.

However, a gap still remains between validation loss and the model's downstream capabilities, making it untrivial to apply scaling law to direct performance prediction for downstream tasks. The loss typically represents a cumulative penalty for predicted tokens, which are implicitly considered to have equal importance. Nevertheless, our studies have shown evidence that when considering different training data distributions, we cannot directly model the relationship between downstream capability and computation or token loss. To bridge the gap between validation loss and downstream task capabilities, in this work, we introduce Capability Salience Vector, which decomposes the overall loss and assigns different importance weights to tokens to assess a specific meta-capability, aligning the validation loss with downstream task performance in terms of the model's capabilities. Experiments on various popular benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed Capability Salience Vector could significantly improve the predictability of language model performance on downstream tasks.

  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate significant cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, financial applications face challenges due to the lack of high-quality multimodal reasoning datasets and the inefficiency of existing training paradigms for reasoning enhancement. To address these issues, we propose an integrated framework, FinLMM-R1, combining an automated and scalable pipeline for data construction with enhanced training strategies to improve the multimodal reasoning of LMM. The Automated and Scalable Pipeline (ASP) resolves textual-visual misalignment in financial reports through a separate paradigm of question-answer generation and image-question alignment, ensuring data integrity and extraction efficiency. Through ASP, we collect 89,378 aligned image-question pairs from 23,397 financial reports, covering tasks such as arithmetic reasoning, statistics reasoning, financial explanation, and financial knowledge. Moreover, we introduce the Thinking with Adversarial Reward in LMM (TAR-LMM), extending the prior two-stage training framework [1] with additional reward mechanisms. In the first stage, we focus on text-only tasks with format and accuracy rewards to guide the model in generating well-structured thinking contents. In the second stage, we construct multi-image contrastive samples with additional reward components including image selection, thinking content length, and adversarial reward to jointly optimize the LMM across visual perception, reasoning efficiency, and logical coherence. Extensive experiments on 7 benchmarks show ASP-derived dataset and training framework significantly improve answer accuracy and reasoning depth over existing reasoning LMMs in both general and financial multimodal contexts.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved with the growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) and are now applied in various fields. In finance, the integration of diverse modalities such as text, charts, and tables is crucial for accurate and efficient decision-making. Therefore, an effective evaluation system that incorporates these data types is essential for advancing financial application. In this paper, we introduce CFBenchmark-MM, a Chinese multimodal financial benchmark with over 9,000 image-question pairs featuring tables, histogram charts, line charts, pie charts, and structural diagrams. Additionally, we develop a staged evaluation system to assess MLLMs in handling multimodal information by providing different visual content step by step. Despite MLLMs having inherent financial knowledge, experimental results still show limited efficiency and robustness in handling multimodal financial context. Further analysis on incorrect responses reveals the misinterpretation of visual content and the misunderstanding of financial concepts are the primary issues. Our research validates the significant, yet underexploited, potential of MLLMs in financial analysis, highlighting the need for further development and domain-specific optimization to encourage the enhanced use in financial domain.

  _Yuanhe Tian, Xu Li, Wei Wang, Guoqing Jin, Pengsen Cheng, Yan Song_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) generally requires a deep understanding of the contextual information, including the words associated with the aspect terms and their syntactic dependencies. Most existing studies employ advanced encoders (e.g., pre-trained models) to capture such context, especially large language models (LLMs). However, training these encoders is resource-intensive, and in many cases, the available data is insufficient for necessary fine-tuning. Therefore it is challenging for learning LLMs within such restricted environments and computation efficiency requirement. As a result, it motivates the exploration of plug-and-play methods that adapt LLMs to ABSA with minimal effort. In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates extendable components capable of incorporating various types of syntactic knowledge, such as constituent syntax, word dependencies, and combinatory categorial grammar (CCG). Specifically, we propose a memory module that records syntactic information and is incorporated into LLMs to instruct the prediction of sentiment polarities. Importantly, this encoder acts as a versatile, detachable plugin that is trained independently of the LLM. We conduct experiments on benchmark datasets, which show that our approach outperforms strong baselines and previous approaches, thus demonstrates its effectiveness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid improvement in the general capabilities of LLMs, LLM personalization, i.e., how to build LLM systems that can generate personalized responses or services that are tailored to distinct user personas, has become an increasingly important research and engineering problem. However, unlike many new challenging benchmarks being released for evaluating the general/reasoning capabilities, the lack of high-quality benchmarks for evaluating LLM personalization greatly hinders progress in this field. To address this, we introduce PersonaFeedback, a new benchmark that directly evaluates LLMs' ability to provide personalized responses given pre-defined user personas and queries. Unlike existing benchmarks that require models to infer implicit user personas from historical interactions, PersonaFeedback decouples persona inference from personalization, focusing on evaluating the model's ability to generate responses tailored to explicit personas. PersonaFeedback consists of 8298 human-annotated test cases, which are categorized into easy, medium, and hard tiers based on the contextual complexity of the user personas and the difficulty in distinguishing subtle differences between two personalized responses. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a wide range of models. The empirical results reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs that can solve complex real-world reasoning tasks could fall short on the hard tier of PersonaFeedback where even human evaluators may find the distinctions challenging. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of failure modes across various types of systems, demonstrating that the current retrieval-augmented framework should not be seen as a de facto solution for personalization tasks. All benchmark data, annotation protocols, and the evaluation pipeline will be publicly available to facilitate future research on LLM personalization.

  Advancement in Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning capabilities enables them to solve scientific problems with enhanced efficacy. Thereby, a high-quality benchmark for comprehensive and appropriate assessment holds significance, while existing ones either confront the risk of data contamination or lack involved disciplines. To be specific, due to the data source overlap of LLMs training and static benchmark, the keys or number pattern of answers inadvertently memorized (i.e. data contamination), leading to systematic overestimation of their reasoning capabilities, especially numerical reasoning. We propose SciDA, a multidisciplinary benchmark that consists exclusively of over 1k Olympic-level numerical computation problems, allowing randomized numerical initializations for each inference round to avoid reliance on fixed numerical patterns. We conduct a series of experiments with both closed-source and open-source top-performing LLMs, and it is observed that the performance of LLMs drop significantly under random numerical initialization. Thus, we provide truthful and unbiased assessments of the numerical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The data is available atthis https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for task adaptation in large language models (LLMs), where models infer underlying task structures from a few demonstrations. However, ICL remains susceptible to biases that arise from prior knowledge and contextual demonstrations, which can degrade the performance of LLMs. Existing bias calibration methods typically apply fixed class priors across all inputs, limiting their efficacy in dynamic ICL settings where the context for each query differs. To address these limitations, we adopt implicit sequential Bayesian inference as a framework for interpreting ICL, identify "surprise" as an informative signal for class prior shift, and introduce a novel method--Surprise Calibration (SC). SC leverages the notion of surprise to capture the temporal dynamics of class priors, providing a more adaptive and computationally efficient solution for in-context learning. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of SC over existing bias calibration techniques across a range of benchmark natural language processing tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robust unlearning is crucial for safely deploying large language models (LLMs) in environments where data privacy, model safety, and regulatory compliance must be ensured. Yet the task is inherently challenging, partly due to difficulties in reliably measuring whether unlearning has truly occurred. Moreover, fragmentation in current methodologies and inconsistent evaluation metrics hinder comparative analysis and reproducibility. To unify and accelerate research efforts, we introduce OpenUnlearning, a standardized and extensible framework designed explicitly for benchmarking both LLM unlearning methods and metrics. OpenUnlearning integrates 9 unlearning algorithms and 16 diverse evaluations across 3 leading benchmarks (TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP) and also enables analyses of forgetting behaviors across 450+ checkpoints we publicly release. Leveraging OpenUnlearning, we propose a novel meta-evaluation benchmark focused specifically on assessing the faithfulness and robustness of evaluation metrics themselves. We also benchmark diverse unlearning methods and provide a comparative analysis against an extensive evaluation suite. Overall, we establish a clear, community-driven pathway toward rigorous development in LLM unlearning research.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress on reasoning tasks involving unstructured text, yet their capabilities significantly deteriorate when reasoning requires integrating structured external knowledge such as knowledge graphs, code snippets, or formal logic. This limitation is partly due to the absence of benchmarks capable of systematically evaluating LLM performance across diverse structured knowledge modalities. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{\textsc{OneEval}}, a comprehensive benchmark explicitly designed to assess the knowledge-intensive reasoning capabilities of LLMs across four structured knowledge modalities, unstructured text, knowledge graphs, code, and formal logic, and five critical domains (general knowledge, government, science, law, and programming). \textsc{OneEval} comprises 4,019 carefully curated instances and includes a challenging subset, \textsc{OneEval}\textsubscript{Hard}, consisting of 1,285 particularly difficult cases. Through extensive evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, we establish three core findings: a) \emph{persistent limitations in structured reasoning}, with even the strongest model achieving only 32.2\% accuracy on \textsc{OneEval}\textsubscript{Hard}; b) \emph{performance consistently declines as the structural complexity of the knowledge base increases}, with accuracy dropping sharply from 53\% (textual reasoning) to 25\% (formal logic); and c) \emph{diminishing returns from extended reasoning chains}, highlighting the critical need for models to adapt reasoning depth appropriately to task complexity. We release the \textsc{OneEval} datasets, evaluation scripts, and baseline results publicly, accompanied by a leaderboard to facilitate ongoing advancements in structured knowledge reasoning.

  This paper investigates the influence of cognitive biases on Large Language Models (LLMs) outputs. Cognitive biases, such as confirmation and availability biases, can distort user inputs through prompts, potentially leading to unfaithful and misleading outputs from LLMs. Using a systematic framework, our study introduces various cognitive biases into prompts and assesses their impact on LLM accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets, including general and financial Q&A scenarios. The results demonstrate that even subtle biases can significantly alter LLM answer choices, highlighting a critical need for bias-aware prompt design and mitigation strategy. Additionally, our attention weight analysis highlights how these biases can alter the internal decision-making processes of LLMs, affecting the attention distribution in ways that are associated with output inaccuracies. This research has implications for Al developers and users in enhancing the robustness and reliability of Al applications in diverse domains.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models are trained mainly on massive text data from the Internet, and it becomes increasingly important to understand this data source. Exact-match search engines enable searching in large text corpora -- counting string appearances and retrieving the enclosing documents -- yet the high storage overhead hinders their application on Internet-scale data. We present Infini-gram mini, an efficient and scalable system that can make petabyte-level text corpora searchable. Based on the FM-index data structure (Ferragina and Manzini, 2000), which simultaneously indexes and compresses text, our system creates indexes with size only 44% of the corpus. Infini-gram mini greatly improves upon the best existing implementation of FM-index in terms of indexing speed (18$\times$) and memory use during both indexing (3.2$\times$ reduction) and querying (down to a negligible amount). We index 46TB of Internet text in 50 days with a single 128-core CPU node (or 19 hours if using 75 such nodes). We show one important use case of Infini-gram mini in a large-scale analysis of benchmark contamination. We find several core LM evaluation benchmarks to be heavily contaminated in Internet crawls (up to 40% in SQuAD), which could lead to overestimating the capabilities of language models if trained on such data. We host a benchmark contamination bulletin to share the contamination rate of many core and community-contributed benchmarks. We also release a web interface and an API endpoint to serve general search queries on Infini-gram mini indexes.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in medical question answering (MedQA), yet adapting them to biomedical reasoning remains challenging due to domain-specific complexity and limited supervision. In this work, we study how prompt design and lightweight fine-tuning affect the performance of open-source LLMs on PubMedQA, a benchmark for multiple-choice biomedical questions. We focus on two widely used prompting strategies - standard instruction prompts and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts - and apply QLoRA for parameter-efficient instruction tuning. Across multiple model families and sizes, our experiments show that CoT prompting alone can improve reasoning in zero-shot settings, while instruction tuning significantly boosts accuracy. However, fine-tuning on CoT prompts does not universally enhance performance and may even degrade it for certain larger models. These findings suggest that reasoning-aware prompts are useful, but their benefits are model- and scale-dependent. Our study offers practical insights into combining prompt engineering with efficient finetuning for medical QA applications.

  Language changes over time, including in the hate speech domain, which evolves quickly following social dynamics and cultural shifts. While NLP research has investigated the impact of language evolution on model training and has proposed several solutions for it, its impact on model benchmarking remains under-explored. Yet, hate speech benchmarks play a crucial role to ensure model safety. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the robustness of 20 language models across two evolving hate speech experiments, and we show the temporal misalignment between static and time-sensitive evaluations. Our findings call for time-sensitive linguistic benchmarks in order to correctly and reliably evaluate language models in the hate speech domain.

  Digital technologies are increasingly used in education to reduce the workload of teachers and students. However, creating open-ended study or examination questions and grading their answers is still a tedious task. This thesis presents the foundation for a system that generates questions grounded in class materials and automatically grades student answers. It introduces a sophisticated method for chunking documents with a visual layout, specifically targeting PDF documents. This method enhances the accuracy of downstream tasks, including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Our thesis demonstrates that high-quality questions and reference answers can be generated from study material. Further, it introduces a new benchmark for automated grading of short answers to facilitate comparison of automated grading systems. An evaluation of various grading systems is conducted and indicates that Large Language Models (LLMs) can generalise to the task of automated grading of short answers from their pre-training tasks. As with other tasks, increasing the parameter size of the LLMs leads to greater performance. Currently, available systems still need human oversight, especially in examination scenarios.

  How can we quantize large language models while preserving accuracy? Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Binary-coding quantization (BCQ) and uniform quantization (UQ) are promising quantization schemes that have strong expressiveness and optimizability, respectively. However, neither scheme leverages both advantages. In this paper, we propose UniQuanF (Unified Quantization with Flexible Mapping), an accurate quantization method for LLMs. UniQuanF harnesses both strong expressiveness and optimizability by unifying the flexible mapping technique in UQ and non-uniform quantization levels of BCQ. We propose unified initialization, and local and periodic mapping techniques to optimize the parameters in UniQuanF precisely. After optimization, our unification theorem removes computational and memory overhead, allowing us to utilize the superior accuracy of UniQuanF without extra deployment costs induced by the unification. Experimental results demonstrate that UniQuanF outperforms existing UQ and BCQ methods, achieving up to 4.60% higher accuracy on GSM8K benchmark.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Processing structured tabular data, particularly large and lengthy tables, constitutes a fundamental yet challenging task for large language models (LLMs). However, existing long-context benchmarks like Needle-in-a-Haystack primarily focus on unstructured text, neglecting the challenge of diverse structured tables. Meanwhile, previous tabular benchmarks mainly consider downstream tasks that require high-level reasoning abilities, and overlook models' underlying fine-grained perception of individual table cells, which is crucial for practical and robust LLM-based table applications. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{NeedleInATable} (NIAT), a new long-context tabular benchmark that treats each table cell as a ``needle'' and requires models to extract the target cell based on cell locations or lookup questions. Our comprehensive evaluation of various LLMs and multimodal LLMs reveals a substantial performance gap between popular downstream tabular tasks and the simpler NIAT task, suggesting that they may rely on dataset-specific correlations or shortcuts to obtain better benchmark results but lack truly robust long-context understanding towards structured tables. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using synthesized NIAT training data can effectively improve performance on both NIAT task and downstream tabular tasks, which validates the importance of NIAT capability for LLMs' genuine table understanding ability. Our data, code and models will be released to facilitate future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Schema linking is a critical bottleneck in applying existing Text-to-SQL models to real-world, large-scale, multi-database environments. Through error analysis, we identify two major challenges in schema linking: (1) Database Retrieval: accurately selecting the target database from a large schema pool, while effectively filtering out irrelevant ones; and (2) Schema Item Grounding: precisely identifying the relevant tables and columns within complex and often redundant schemas for SQL generation. Based on these, we introduce LinkAlign, a novel framework tailored for large-scale databases with thousands of fields. LinkAlign comprises three key steps: multi-round semantic enhanced retrieval and irrelevant information isolation for Challenge 1, and schema extraction enhancement for Challenge 2. Each stage supports both Agent and Pipeline execution modes, enabling balancing efficiency and performance via modular design. To enable more realistic evaluation, we construct AmbiDB, a synthetic dataset designed to reflect the ambiguity of real-world schema linking. Experiments on widely-used Text-to-SQL benchmarks demonstrate that LinkAlign consistently outperforms existing baselines on all schema linking metrics. Notably, it improves the overall Text-to-SQL pipeline and achieves a new state-of-the-art score of 33.09% on the Spider 2.0-Lite benchmark using only open-source LLMs, ranking first on the leaderboard at the time of submission.

  Chinese spelling correction (CSC) is a crucial task that aims to correct character errors in Chinese text. While conventional CSC focuses on character substitution errors caused by mistyping, two other common types of character errors, missing and redundant characters, have received less attention. These errors are often excluded from CSC datasets during the annotation process or ignored during evaluation, even when they have been annotated. This issue limits the practicality of the CSC task. To address this issue, we introduce the task of General Chinese Character Error Correction (C2EC), which focuses on all three types of character errors. We construct a high-quality C2EC benchmark by combining and manually verifying data from CCTC and Lemon datasets. We extend the training-free prompt-free CSC method to C2EC by using Levenshtein distance for handling length changes and leveraging an additional prompt-based large language model (LLM) to improve performance. Experiments show that our method enables a 14B-parameter LLM to be on par with models nearly 50 times larger on both conventional CSC and C2EC tasks, without any fine-tuning.

BAREC consists of 69,441 sentences spanning 1+ million words, carefully curated to cover 19 readability levels, from kindergarten to postgraduate comprehension. The corpus balances genre diversity, topical coverage, and target audiences, offering a comprehensive resource for evaluating Arabic text complexity. The corpus was fully manually annotated by a large team of annotators. The average pairwise inter-annotator agreement, measured by Quadratic Weighted Kappa, is 81.8%, reflecting a high level of substantial agreement. Beyond presenting the corpus, we benchmark automatic readability assessment across different granularity levels, comparing a range of techniques. Our results highlight the challenges and opportunities in Arabic readability modeling, demonstrating competitive performance across various methods. To support research and education, we make BAREC openly available, along with detailed annotation guidelines and benchmark results.

  This paper introduces the Constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (CMCTS) framework to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM). By incorporating a constrained action space, Process Reward Model (PRM), and partial order rules, CMCTS effectively addresses the limitations of existing MCTS methods in terms of state space diversity and action selection rationality. Specifically, during the expansion phase, CMCTS restricts action sampling to a predefined constrained action set to increase candidate state diversity. In the simulation phase, it introduces partial order rules and PRM to optimize action selection and prevent unreasonable state transitions. Experimental results show that CMCTS performs outstandingly across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Under a zero-shot setting, a 7B-parameter model achieves an average accuracy of 83.4\%, surpassing the 72B baseline model by 4.8\%. Ablation studies demonstrate that each component of the framework is crucial for performance improvement, and their combined use fully leverages their respective strengths. Overall, the CMCTS framework provides an effective approach to enhancing LLM mathematical reasoning capabilities, supported by theoretical analysis, and offers novel insights for future reasoning tasks.

  As the fundamental capability behind decision-making in finance, financial reasoning poses distinct challenges for LLMs. Although reinforcement learning (RL) have boosted generic reasoning, the progress in finance is hindered by the absence of empirical study of building effective financial chain-of-thought (CoT) corpus, a systematic comparison of different RL methods, and comprehensive benchmarks. To address these gaps, we introduce FinCoT, the first open high-fidelity CoT corpus for finance, distilled from seven QA datasets by a novel three-stage pipeline that incorporates domain supervision, iterative LLM refinement, and difficulty-aware filtering. Based on FinCoT, we develop Fin-o1, the first open financial reasoning models trained via supervised fine-tuning and GRPO-based RL. Our models outperform existing financial reasoning models and SOTA general models such as GPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and GPT-4.5. We also investigate the effectiveness of three different RL methods in improving domain-specific reasoning, offering the first such empirical study. We finally propose FinReason, the first financial reasoning benchmark covering multi-table analysis, long-context reasoning, and equation-based tasks, and evaluate 29 LLMs. Our extensive experiments reveal general reasoning models excel on standard benchmarks yet exhibit obvious performance degradation in financial contexts; even finance-tuned models like Dianjin-R1 and FinR1 degrade on lengthy documents. In contrast, our Fin-o1 models consistently outperform their backbones and larger GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, confirming the effectiveness of our data building and model training strategy. Our study further shows that GRPO yields reliable gains whereas PPO and DPO do not, highlighting the need for targeted data and optimisation rather than scale alone.

  BOUQuET is a multi-way, multicentric and multi-register/domain dataset and benchmark, and a broader collaborative initiative. This dataset is handcrafted in 8 non-English languages. Each of these source languages are representative of the most widely spoken ones and therefore they have the potential to serve as pivot languages that will enable more accurate translations. The dataset is multicentric to enforce representation of multilingual language features. In addition, the dataset goes beyond the sentence level, as it is organized in paragraphs of various lengths. Compared with related machine translation datasets, we show that BOUQuET has a broader representation of domains while simplifying the translation task for non-experts. Therefore, BOUQuET is specially suitable for crowd-source extension for which we are launching a call aiming at collecting a multi-way parallel corpus covering any written language.

  Current inference scaling methods, such as Self-consistency and Best-of-N, have proven effective in improving the accuracy of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks. However, these methods rely heavily on the quality of candidate responses and are unable to produce correct answers when all candidates are incorrect. In this paper, we propose a novel inference scaling strategy, CoT-based Synthesizer, which leverages CoT reasoning to synthesize superior answers by analyzing complementary information from multiple candidate responses, even when all candidate responses are flawed. To enable a lightweight and cost-effective implementation, we introduce an automated data generation pipeline that creates diverse training data. This allows smaller LLMs trained on this data to improve the inference accuracy of larger models, including API-based LLMs. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets with seven policy models demonstrate that our method significantly enhances performance, with gains of 11.8% for Llama3-8B and 10.3% for GPT-4o on the MATH dataset.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in the medical domain, assisting with tasks like clinical note generation and patient communication. However, current LLMs are limited to text-based communication, hindering their ability to interact with diverse forms of information in clinical environments. Despite clinical agents succeeding in diverse signal interaction, they are oriented to a single clinical scenario and hence fail for broader applications. To evaluate clinical agents holistically, we propose ClinicalAgent Bench~(CAB), a comprehensive medical agent benchmark consisting of 18 tasks across five key realistic clinical dimensions. Building on this, we introduce ReflecTool, a novel framework that excels at utilizing domain-specific tools within two stages. The first optimization stage progressively enlarges a long-term memory by saving successful solving processes and tool-wise experience of agents in a tiny pre-defined training set. In the following inference stage, ReflecTool can search for supportive successful demonstrations from already built long-term memory to guide the tool selection strategy, and a verifier improves the tool usage according to the tool-wise experience with two verification methods--iterative refinement and candidate selection. Extensive experiments on ClinicalAgent Benchmark demonstrate that ReflecTool surpasses the pure LLMs with more than 10 points and the well-established agent-based methods with 3 points, highlighting its adaptability and effectiveness in solving complex clinical tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Fast-and-Frugal Text-Graph (FnF-TG) Transformers, a Transformer-based framework that unifies textual and structural information for inductive link prediction in text-attributed knowledge graphs. We demonstrate that, by effectively encoding ego-graphs (1-hop neighbourhoods), we can reduce the reliance on resource-intensive textual encoders. This makes the model both fast at training and inference time, as well as frugal in terms of cost. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on three popular datasets and show that FnF-TG can achieve superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. We also extend inductive learning to a fully inductive setting, where relations don't rely on transductive (fixed) representations, as in previous work, but are a function of their textual description. Additionally, we introduce new variants of existing datasets, specifically designed to test the performance of models on unseen relations at inference time, thus offering a new test-bench for fully inductive link prediction.

  Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools for solving complex problems can grant them human-like reasoning abilities. ReAct and its variants are popular frameworks for tool use in both single-agent and multi-agent systems. To address issues like error propagation and limited exploration in ReAct, the Deep First Search Decision Tree (DFSDT) was proposed, but it faces challenges such as rollback instability, redundant context, and premature termination in single-agent settings. We introduce "Smurfs," a novel multi-agent system (MAS) that enhances DFSDT with a modular, context-efficient, and training-free design. Smurfs surpasses baseline methods in both the open-ended StableToolBench and the closed-ended HotpotQA tasks, reducing token usage by 60.9\% compared to DFSDT and enabling Mistral-7b to perform on par with GPT-4-DFSDT. Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of Smurfs' core components, offering valuable insights for the construction and interpretation of MAS, and paving the way for future exploration.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Policy has demonstrated strong visuomotor modeling capabilities, but its high computational cost renders it impractical for real-time robotic control. Despite huge redundancy across repetitive denoising steps, existing diffusion acceleration techniques fail to generalize to Diffusion Policy due to fundamental architectural and data divergences. In this paper, we propose Block-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by caching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation acceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block level, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly across timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose the Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps by maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped features. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant error surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly within Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop the Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the upstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a training-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based Diffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference speedup for free.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adaptive Curriculum Sequencing (ACS) is essential for personalized online learning, yet current approaches struggle to balance complex educational constraints and maintain optimization stability. This paper proposes a Memetic Walrus Optimizer (MWO) that enhances optimization performance through three key innovations: (1) an expert-guided strategy with aging mechanism that improves escape from local optima; (2) an adaptive control signal framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation; and (3) a three-tier priority mechanism for generating educationally meaningful sequences. We formulate ACS as a multi-objective optimization problem considering concept coverage, time constraints, and learning style compatibility. Experiments on the OULAD dataset demonstrate MWO's superior performance, achieving 95.3% difficulty progression rate (compared to 87.2% in baseline methods) and significantly better convergence stability (standard deviation of 18.02 versus 28.29-696.97 in competing algorithms). Additional validation on benchmark functions confirms MWO's robust optimization capability across diverse scenarios. The results demonstrate MWO's effectiveness in generating personalized learning sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and solution quality.

  Recent advances in generative AI have led to remarkable interest in using systems that rely on large language models (LLMs) for practical applications. However, meaningful evaluation of these systems in real-world scenarios comes with a distinct set of challenges, which are not well-addressed by synthetic benchmarks and de-facto metrics that are often seen in the literature. We present a practical evaluation framework which outlines how to proactively curate representative datasets, select meaningful evaluation metrics, and employ meaningful evaluation methodologies that integrate well with practical development and deployment of LLM-reliant systems that must adhere to real-world requirements and meet user-facing needs.

  Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled strong chain-of-thought (CoT) generation through test-time computation. While these multi-step reasoning capabilities represent a major milestone in language model performance, they also introduce new safety risks. In this work, we present the first systematic study to revisit the problem of machine unlearning in the context of LRMs. Machine unlearning refers to the process of removing the influence of sensitive, harmful, or undesired data or knowledge from a trained model without full retraining. We show that conventional unlearning algorithms, originally designed for non-reasoning models, are inadequate for LRMs. In particular, even when final answers are successfully erased, sensitive information often persists within the intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., CoT trajectories. To address this challenge, we extend conventional unlearning and propose Reasoning-aware Representation Misdirection for Unlearning ($R^2MU$), a novel method that effectively suppresses sensitive reasoning traces and prevents the generation of associated final answers, while preserving the model's reasoning ability. Our experiments demonstrate that $R^2MU$ significantly reduces sensitive information leakage within reasoning traces and achieves strong performance across both safety and reasoning benchmarks, evaluated on state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B.

  Fact verification is essential for ensuring the reliability of LLM applications. In this study, we evaluate 12 pre-trained LLMs and one specialized fact-verifier, including frontier LLMs and open-weight reasoning LLMs, using a collection of examples from 14 fact-checking benchmarks. We share three findings intended to guide future development of more robust fact verifiers. First, we highlight the importance of addressing annotation errors and ambiguity in datasets, demonstrating that approximately 16\% of ambiguous or incorrectly labeled data substantially influences model rankings. Neglecting this issue may result in misleading conclusions during comparative evaluations, and we suggest using a systematic pipeline utilizing LLM-as-a-judge to help identify these issues at scale. Second, we discover that frontier LLMs with few-shot in-context examples, often overlooked in previous works, achieve top-tier performance. We therefore recommend future studies include comparisons with these simple yet highly effective baselines. Lastly, despite their effectiveness, frontier LLMs incur substantial costs, motivating the development of small, fine-tuned fact verifiers. We show that these small models still have room for improvement, particularly on instances that require complex reasoning. Encouragingly, we demonstrate that augmenting training with synthetic multi-hop reasoning data significantly enhances their capabilities in such instances.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal document retrieval systems enable information access across text, images, and layouts, benefiting various domains like document-based question answering, report analysis, and interactive content summarization. Rerankers improve retrieval precision by reordering retrieved candidates. However, current multimodal reranking methods remain underexplored, with significant room for improvement in both training strategies and overall effectiveness. Moreover, the lack of explicit reasoning makes it difficult to analyze and optimize these methods further. In this paper, We propose MM-R5, a MultiModal Reasoning-Enhanced ReRanker via Reinforcement Learning for Document Retrieval, aiming to provide a more effective and reliable solution for multimodal reranking tasks. MM-R5 is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we focus on improving instruction-following and guiding the model to generate complete and high-quality reasoning chains. To support this, we introduce a novel data construction strategy that produces rich, high-quality reasoning data. In the RL stage, we design a task-specific reward framework, including a reranking reward tailored for multimodal candidates and a composite template-based reward to further refine reasoning quality. We conduct extensive experiments on MMDocIR, a challenging public benchmark spanning multiple domains. MM-R5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on most metrics and delivers comparable results to much larger models on the remaining ones. Moreover, compared to the best retrieval-only method, MM-R5 improves recall@1 by over 4%. These results validate the effectiveness of our reasoning-enhanced training pipeline.

  Precision process planning in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining demands rapid, context-aware decisions on tool selection, feed-speed pairs, and multi-axis routing, placing immense cognitive and procedural burdens on engineers from design specification through final part inspection. Conventional rule-based computer-aided process planning and knowledge-engineering shells freeze domain know-how into static tables, which become limited when dealing with unseen topologies, novel material states, shifting cost-quality-sustainability weightings, or shop-floor constraints such as tool unavailability and energy caps. Large language models (LLMs) promise flexible, instruction-driven reasoning for tasks but they routinely hallucinate numeric values and provide no provenance. We present Augmented Retrieval Knowledge Network Enhanced Search & Synthesis (ARKNESS), the end-to-end framework that fuses zero-shot Knowledge Graph (KG) construction with retrieval-augmented generation to deliver verifiable, numerically exact answers for CNC process planning. ARKNESS (1) automatically distills heterogeneous machining documents, G-code annotations, and vendor datasheets into augmented triple, multi-relational graphs without manual labeling, and (2) couples any on-prem LLM with a retriever that injects the minimal, evidence-linked subgraph needed to answer a query. Benchmarked on 155 industry-curated questions spanning tool sizing and feed-speed optimization, a lightweight 3B-parameter Llama-3 augmented by ARKNESS matches GPT-4o accuracy while achieving a +25 percentage point gain in multiple-choice accuracy, +22.4 pp in F1, and 8.1x ROUGE-L on open-ended responses.

  With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, increasing attention has been given to their social interaction and strategic reasoning capabilities. However, existing Werewolf-based benchmarking platforms suffer from overly simplified game settings, incomplete evaluation metrics, and poor scalability. To address these limitations, we propose WereWolf-Plus, a multi-model, multi-dimensional, and multi-method benchmarking platform for evaluating multi-agent strategic reasoning in the Werewolf game. The platform offers strong extensibility, supporting customizable configurations for roles such as Seer, Witch, Hunter, Guard, and Sheriff, along with flexible model assignment and reasoning enhancement strategies for different roles. In addition, we introduce a comprehensive set of quantitative evaluation metrics for all special roles, werewolves, and the sheriff, and enrich the assessment dimensions for agent reasoning ability, cooperation capacity, and social influence. WereWolf-Plus provides a more flexible and reliable environment for advancing research on inference and strategic interaction within multi-agent communities.

  Large language models (LLMs) are prone to three types of hallucination: Input-Conflicting, Context-Conflicting and Fact-Conflicting hallucinations. The purpose of this study is to mitigate the different types of hallucination by exploiting the interdependence between them. For this purpose, we propose a Multi-Information Adapter for Large Language Models (MALM). This framework employs a tailored multi-graph learning approach designed to elucidate the interconnections between original inputs, contextual information, and external factual knowledge, thereby alleviating the three categories of hallucination within a cohesive framework. Experiments were carried out on four benchmarking datasets: HaluEval, TruthfulQA, Natural Questions, and TriviaQA. We evaluated the proposed framework in two aspects: (1) adaptability to different base LLMs on HaluEval and TruthfulQA, to confirm if MALM is effective when applied on 7 typical LLMs. MALM showed significant improvements over LLaMA-2; (2) generalizability to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by combining MALM with three representative retrievers (BM25, Spider and DPR) separately. Furthermore, automated and human evaluations were conducted to substantiate the correctness of experimental results, where GPT-4 and 3 human volunteers judged which response was better between LLaMA-2 and MALM. The results showed that both GPT-4 and human preferred MALM in 79.4% and 65.6% of cases respectively. The results validate that incorporating the complex interactions between the three types of hallucination through a multilayered graph attention network into the LLM generation process is effective to mitigate the them. The adapter design of the proposed approach is also proven flexible and robust across different base LLMs.

  Travel planning is a complex task requiring the integration of diverse real-world information and user preferences. While LLMs show promise, existing methods with long-horizon thinking struggle with handling multifaceted constraints and preferences in the context, leading to suboptimal itineraries. We formulate this as an $L^3$ planning problem, emphasizing long context, long instruction, and long output. To tackle this, we introduce Multiple Aspects of Planning (MAoP), enabling LLMs to conduct wide-horizon thinking to solve complex planning problems. Instead of direct planning, MAoP leverages the strategist to conduct pre-planning from various aspects and provide the planning blueprint for planning models, enabling strong inference-time scalability for better performance. In addition, current benchmarks overlook travel's dynamic nature, where past events impact subsequent journeys, failing to reflect real-world feasibility. To address this, we propose Travel-Sim, an agent-based benchmark assessing plans via real-world travel simulation. This work advances LLM capabilities in complex planning and offers novel insights for evaluating sophisticated scenarios through agent-based simulation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating consistency in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring reliability, particularly in complex, multi-step interactions between humans and LLMs. Traditional self-consistency methods often miss subtle semantic changes in natural language and functional shifts in code or equations, which can accumulate over multiple transformations. To address this, we propose ConsistencyChecker, a tree-based evaluation framework designed to measure consistency through sequences of reversible transformations, including machine translation tasks and AI-assisted programming tasks. In our framework, nodes represent distinct text states, while edges correspond to pairs of inverse operations. Dynamic and LLM-generated benchmarks ensure a fair assessment of the model's generalization ability and eliminate benchmark leakage. Consistency is quantified based on similarity across different depths of the transformation tree. Experiments on eight models from various families and sizes show that ConsistencyChecker can distinguish the performance of different models. Notably, our consistency scores-computed entirely without using WMT paired data-correlate strongly (r > 0.7) with WMT 2024 auto-ranking, demonstrating the validity of our benchmark-free approach. Our implementation is available at:this https URL.

  The reasoning steps generated by LLMs might be incomplete, as they mimic logical leaps common in everyday communication found in their pre-training data: underlying rationales are frequently left implicit (unstated). To address this challenge, we introduce RATIONALYST, a model for process-supervision of reasoning based on pre-training on a vast collection of rationale annotations extracted from unlabeled data. We extract 79k rationales from web-scale unlabelled dataset (the Pile) and a combination of reasoning datasets with minimal human intervention. This web-scale pre-training for reasoning allows RATIONALYST to consistently generalize across diverse reasoning tasks, including mathematical, commonsense, scientific, and logical reasoning. Fine-tuned from LLaMa-3-8B, RATIONALYST improves the accuracy of reasoning by an average of 3.9% on 7 representative reasoning benchmarks. It also demonstrates superior performance compared to significantly larger verifiers like GPT-4 and similarly sized models fine-tuned on matching training sets.

  The Da Vinci Code, a game of logical deduction and imperfect information, presents unique challenges for artificial intelligence, demanding nuanced reasoning beyond simple pattern recognition. This paper investigates the efficacy of various AI paradigms in mastering this game. We develop and evaluate three distinct agent architectures: a Transformer-based baseline model with limited historical context, several Large Language Model (LLM) agents (including Gemini, DeepSeek, and GPT variants) guided by structured prompts, and an agent based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) employing a Transformer encoder for comprehensive game history processing. Performance is benchmarked against the baseline, with the PPO-based agent demonstrating superior win rates ($58.5\% \pm 1.0\%$), significantly outperforming the LLM counterparts. Our analysis highlights the strengths of deep reinforcement learning in policy refinement for complex deductive tasks, particularly in learning implicit strategies from self-play. We also examine the capabilities and inherent limitations of current LLMs in maintaining strict logical consistency and strategic depth over extended gameplay, despite sophisticated prompting. This study contributes to the broader understanding of AI in recreational games involving hidden information and multi-step logical reasoning, offering insights into effective agent design and the comparative advantages of different AI approaches.

  Humans engage in lifelong social interactions through interacting with different people under different scenarios for different social goals. This requires social intelligence to gather information through a long time span and use it to navigate various social contexts effectively. Whether AI systems are also capable of this is understudied in the existing research. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark, LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, to perform a comprehensive evaluation of language agents by simulating multi-episode interactions. In each episode, the language agents role-play characters to achieve their respective social goals in randomly sampled social tasks. With LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, we find that goal achievement and believability of all of the language models that we test decline through the whole interaction. Although using an advanced memory method improves the agents' performance, the best agents still achieve a significantly lower goal completion rate than humans on scenarios requiring an explicit understanding of interaction history. These findings show that we can use LIFELONG-SOTOPIA to evaluate the social intelligence of language agents over lifelong social interactions.

  Verifying the reliability of complex, multi-step reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge, as existing methods often lack both faithfulness and precision. To address this issue, we propose the Graph of Verification (GoV) framework. GoV offers three key contributions: First, it explicitly models the underlying deductive process as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), whether this structure is implicit or explicitly constructed. Second, it enforces a topological order over the DAG to guide stepwise verification. Third, GoV introduces the notion of customizable node blocks, which flexibly define the verification granularity, from atomic propositions to full paragraphs, while ensuring that all requisite premises derived from the graph are provided as contextual input for each verification unit. We evaluate GoV on the Number Triangle Summation task and the ProcessBench benchmark with varying levels of reasoning complexity. Experimental results show that GoV substantially improves verification accuracy, faithfulness, and error localization when compared to conventional end-to-end verification approaches.

  Recent advances in agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in solving complex tasks. However, most current methods lack mechanisms for coordinating specialized agents and have limited ability to generalize to new or diverse domains. We introduce \projectname, a hierarchical multi-agent framework for general-purpose task solving that integrates high-level planning with modular agent collaboration. Inspired by the way a conductor orchestrates a symphony and guided by the principles of \textit{extensibility}, \textit{multimodality}, \textit{modularity}, and \textit{coordination}, \projectname features a central planning agent that decomposes complex objectives and delegates sub-tasks to a team of specialized agents. Each sub-agent is equipped with general programming and analytical tools, as well as abilities to tackle a wide range of real-world specific tasks, including data analysis, file operations, web navigation, and interactive reasoning in dynamic multimodal environments. \projectname supports flexible orchestration through explicit sub-goal formulation, inter-agent communication, and adaptive role allocation. We evaluate the framework on three widely used benchmark datasets covering various real-world tasks, searching web pages, reasoning over heterogeneous modalities, etc. Experimental results demonstrate that \projectname consistently outperforms flat-agent and monolithic baselines in task success rate and adaptability. These findings highlight the effectiveness of hierarchical organization and role specialization in building scalable and general-purpose LLM-based agent systems.

  Children's emotional development fundamentally relies on secure attachment relationships, yet current AI companions lack the theoretical foundation to provide developmentally appropriate emotional support. We introduce DinoCompanion, the first attachment-theory-grounded multimodal robot for emotionally responsive child-AI interaction. We address three critical challenges in child-AI systems: the absence of developmentally-informed AI architectures, the need to balance engagement with safety, and the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks for attachment-based capabilities. Our contributions include: (i) a multimodal dataset of 128 caregiver-child dyads containing 125,382 annotated clips with paired preference-risk labels, (ii) CARPO (Child-Aware Risk-calibrated Preference Optimization), a novel training objective that maximizes engagement while applying epistemic-uncertainty-weighted risk penalties, and (iii) AttachSecure-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering ten attachment-centric competencies with strong expert consensus (\k{appa}=0.81). DinoCompanion achieves state-of-the-art performance (57.15%), outperforming GPT-4o (50.29%) and Claude-3.7-Sonnet (53.43%), with exceptional secure base behaviors (72.99%, approaching human expert levels of 78.4%) and superior attachment risk detection (69.73%). Ablations validate the critical importance of multimodal fusion, uncertainty-aware risk modeling, and hierarchical memory for coherent, emotionally attuned interactions.

To address this, we propose Tiered Agentic Oversight (TAO), a hierarchical multi-agent framework that enhances AI safety through layered, automated supervision. Inspired by clinical hierarchies (e.g., nurse, physician, specialist), TAO conducts agent routing based on task complexity and agent roles. Leveraging automated inter- and intra-tier collaboration and role-playing, TAO creates a robust safety framework. Ablation studies reveal that TAO's superior performance is driven by its adaptive tiered architecture, which improves safety by over 3.2% compared to static single-tier configurations; the critical role of its lower tiers, particularly tier 1, whose removal most significantly impacts safety; and the strategic assignment of more advanced LLM to these initial tiers, which boosts performance by over 2% compared to less optimal allocations while achieving near-peak safety efficiently. These mechanisms enable TAO to outperform single-agent and multi-agent frameworks in 4 out of 5 healthcare safety benchmarks, showing up to an 8.2% improvement over the next-best methods in these evaluations. Finally, we validate TAO via an auxiliary clinician-in-the-loop study where integrating expert feedback improved TAO's accuracy in medical triage from 40% to 60%.

  To effectively engage in human society, the ability to adapt, filter information, and make informed decisions in ever-changing situations is critical. As robots and intelligent agents become more integrated into human life, there is a growing opportunity-and need-to offload the cognitive burden on humans to these systems, particularly in dynamic, information-rich scenarios.To fill this critical need, we present Multi-RAG, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation system designed to provide adaptive assistance to humans in information-intensive circumstances. Our system aims to improve situational understanding and reduce cognitive load by integrating and reasoning over multi-source information streams, including video, audio, and text. As an enabling step toward long-term human-robot partnerships, Multi-RAG explores how multimodal information understanding can serve as a foundation for adaptive robotic assistance in dynamic, human-centered situations. To evaluate its capability in a realistic human-assistance proxy task, we benchmarked Multi-RAG on the MMBench-Video dataset, a challenging multimodal video understanding benchmark. Our system achieves superior performance compared to existing open-source video large language models (Video-LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs), while utilizing fewer resources and less input data. The results demonstrate Multi- RAG's potential as a practical and efficient foundation for future human-robot adaptive assistance systems in dynamic, real-world contexts.

  While large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning excel in mathematics and coding, their potential for systematic reasoning in chemistry, a domain demanding rigorous structural analysis for real-world tasks like drug design and reaction engineering, remains untapped. Current benchmarks focus on simple knowledge retrieval, neglecting step-by-step reasoning required for complex tasks such as molecular optimization and reaction prediction. To address this, we introduce ChemCoTBench, a reasoning framework that bridges molecular structure understanding with arithmetic-inspired operations, including addition, deletion, and substitution, to formalize chemical problem-solving into transparent, step-by-step workflows. By treating molecular transformations as modular "chemical operations", the framework enables slow-thinking reasoning, mirroring the logic of mathematical proofs while grounding solutions in real-world chemical constraints. We evaluate models on two high-impact tasks: Molecular Property Optimization and Chemical Reaction Prediction. These tasks mirror real-world challenges while providing structured evaluability. By providing annotated datasets, a reasoning taxonomy, and baseline evaluations, ChemCoTBench bridges the gap between abstract reasoning methods and practical chemical discovery, establishing a foundation for advancing LLMs as tools for AI-driven scientific innovation.

  Achieving human-level intelligence requires refining the transition from the fast, intuitive System 1 to the slower, more deliberate System 2 reasoning. While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \href{this https URL}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and drive progress in this rapidly evolving field.
